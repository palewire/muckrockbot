Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863 (2015).\r\n\r\nNISSEN AFFIDAVIT AND ALL DEVICE SEARCH REQUIRED\r\n\r\nPursuant to Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863 (2015), and its progeny, this request specifically includes all responsive public records contained on personal devices or personal accounts (including personal cell phones, text/SMS/MMS, personal email accounts, cloud storage, instant messaging apps, and social media accounts) of any agency employee, official, or contractor where public business may have been conducted.\r\n\r\nTo comply with this requirement, please:\r\n\r\nConduct a comprehensive all-device search, including both agency-issued and personally owned devices/accounts used for public business.\r\n\r\nRequire each potentially responsive custodian to execute a Nissen affidavit or sworn certification affirming:\r\n\r\nThat they conducted a diligent search of all personal and agency devices/accounts reasonably likely to contain responsive records;\r\n\r\nThe methods used to conduct the search (e.g., search terms, accounts checked, device types); and\r\n\r\nWhether any responsive records were located, preserved, and produced.\r\n\r\nProduce all responsive records located in such searches along with the executed affidavits.\r\n\r\nFailure to obtain and provide sworn Nissen affidavits or equivalent certifications from custodians may constitute an incomplete search in violation of RCW 42.56.520 (requirement for a reasonable and adequate search) and may expose the agency to relief under RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nFORMAT OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPlease provide the video recordings in their original, native digital format (e.g., .mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, .wmv, .webm, or platform-native format).\r\n\r\nFiles should be delivered unedited and uncut, preserving all metadata (timestamps, file properties, source identifiers).\r\n\r\nDeliver the records by direct electronic means: either (a) direct email attachment where feasible, or (b) a direct, no-password, no-registration-required download link hosted by your agency.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDIGITAL COMPRESSION AND FILE MINIMIZATION REQUESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.080(2), please provide all responsive electronic records in the fewest number of individual files, preserving native formats wherever possible. Where appropriate, please use free digital compression (.zip or equivalent) to consolidate responsive records into the smallest number of installments for efficiency and economy.\r\n\r\nThis approach reduces agency burden, promotes prompt disclosure, and minimizes potential costs to the requestor, consistent with the Public Records Act\u2019s directive that agencies provide records in the most \u201creasonably locatable form\u201d and \u201cfullest assistance to requestors.\u201d See RCW 42.56.100 (agency duty to adopt reasonable rules for providing fullest assistance); RCW 42.56.120(2)(b) (fees must reflect actual costs, not used to discourage access).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have consistently held that agencies must facilitate access in a practical, non-burdensome manner. See Fisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014) (agencies must provide records in a usable format when reasonably feasible); Mechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009) (PRA is to be liberally construed in favor of disclosure). Producing consolidated, digitally compressed files satisfies these obligations by reducing unnecessary fragmentation and excess per-page charges.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I request that each installment be produced as a single compressed .zip file (or as few as technically necessary), containing all responsive records in native format, to ensure both compliance with RCW 42.56 and an economical calculation of any applicable public records fees.\r\n\r\nUSE OF THIRD PARTY PORTALS NOT MANDATORY\r\n\r\nPlease note that under Washington\u2019s Public Records Act, use of a third-party \u201cportal\u201d is not mandatory for requestors. Agencies may not condition access to records on the creation of an account, the use of a login, or the acceptance of third-party vendor terms.\r\n\r\nThird-party portals (such as GovQA, NextRequest, JustFOIA, or similar systems) often:\r\n\r\nRequire account creation or login credentials;\r\n\r\nRestrict downloads, viewing times, or re-access;\r\n\r\nRemove or disable links after a limited period;\r\n\r\nPlace records behind commercial platforms operated by for-profit corporations.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions unlawfully burden and condition access to public records. The Public Records Act forbids agencies from imposing access barriers beyond those authorized by statute.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080(2): An agency \u201cshall not deny a request for identifiable public records solely on the basis that the request is overbroad.\u201d Agencies must provide the \u201cfullest assistance\u201d and \u201cmost timely possible action\u201d to requestors.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.550(1): Courts are directed to liberally construe the PRA to ensure access and strictly construe exemptions against withholding.\r\n\r\nFisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014): Agencies must produce records in a \u201creasonably usable format when feasible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009): PRA is to be liberally construed in favor of disclosure and cannot be restricted by agency practices.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I respectfully decline use of any third-party portal. Please provide all responsive records via:\r\n\r\nDirect electronic email attachment to this requestor\u2019s address, or\r\n\r\nA direct, open (no password, no registration required) cloud-based download link hosted by your agency.\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION ON THIRD PARTY VENDORS\r\n\r\nDo not register this requestor with, nor direct this requestor to, any third-party commercial portal, including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA (a Granicus Corporation), NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA, FOIADirect, or any similar online service.\r\n\r\nDo not transmit any portion of this request, or responsive records, to any for-profit vendor or portal. Doing so would unlawfully condition access to public records and contravene both RCW 42.56.080 and RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being submitted via email, consistent with Washington\u2019s Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080(2) provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\u201cAgencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency\u2019s normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency-provided form or web page.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nA request submitted by email is a valid, enforceable method of making a PRA request.\r\n\r\nAgencies may recommend, but cannot require, the use of an online portal or official form.\r\n\r\nAny refusal to honor this request as submitted would directly conflict with RCW 42.56.080 and the agency\u2019s duty under RCW 42.56.100 to provide the \u201cfullest assistance to requestors\u201d and adopt reasonable rules that do not \u201cunreasonably hinder or delay\u201d access.\r\n\r\nWashington courts have emphasized that the PRA must be liberally construed in favor of disclosure and access, and that agencies cannot impose unauthorized barriers:\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009) (\u201cThe PRA is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure of public records.\u201d).\r\n\r\nFisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014) (records must be produced in a reasonably usable format when feasible).\r\n\r\nNissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863, 875 (2015) (the PRA is to be interpreted liberally to promote access and accountability).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this request is to be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email, as submitted. Should the agency fail to process this request in compliance with statute, relief will be sought pursuant to RCW 42.56.550 in the form of judicial review, penalties, and attorney\u2019s fees.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log.\r\n\r\nThe log must:\r\n\r\n* Identify the valid legal reason (statutory citation) for each exemption;\r\n* Specify the location of each redaction within the record produced (via footnote, coded reference, or margin notation);\r\n* State the number of pages or records withheld in their entirety, if any; and\r\n* Demonstrate that only the **minimal exempt portion** of any record has been withheld, as required by law.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Public Records Act requires agencies to justify each withholding or redaction:\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.210(3): \u201cAgency responses refusing, in whole or in part, inspection of any public record shall include a statement of the specific exemption authorizing the withholding of the record (or part) and a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record withheld.\u201d\r\nRCW 42.56.210(1): Exemptions must be narrowly construed.\r\n\r\nWashington courts have repeatedly enforced this duty:\r\n\r\nRental Housing Ass\u2019n of Puget Sound v. City of Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 538 (2009): Agencies must provide specific explanations for each exemption; conclusory or vague justifications are insufficient.\r\nSanders v. State*, 169 Wn.2d 827, 845 (2010): \u201cThe burden of proof is on the agency to establish that refusal to permit public inspection and copying is in accordance with a statute.\u201d\r\nResident Action Council v. Seattle Housing Auth.* 177 Wn.2d 417, 433 (2013): Agencies must disclose the non-exempt portions*of records and cannot withhold more than necessary.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request that your agency provide an itemized exemption log with each installment of records produced, in compliance with RCW 42.56.210(3) and the above case law, ensuring transparency and accountability in the redaction process.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nCommercial Purpose Declaration\r\n\r\nThis public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose. The Washington State Public Records Act (PRA) prohibits agencies from disclosing \u201clists of individuals\u201d for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.070(8) states:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency to give, sell, or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nThis request does not seek a \u201clist of individuals.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is not made for any commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThis declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56.070(8) regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nWarning: The PRA does not authorize agencies to require requestors to complete additional \u201ccommercial purpose declarations\u201d when the request does not seek a list of individuals. Such requirements improperly condition access to public records in violation of RCW 42.56.080(2) (requests must be honored by mail or email, no official format required) and RCW 42.56.100 (agencies must provide the fullest assistance to requestors and may not adopt rules that unreasonably hinder or delay access).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have consistently rejected agency attempts to impose conditions not found in statute:\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009): The PRA is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure; agencies cannot erect unauthorized barriers.\r\n\r\nSEIU 925 v. University of Washington, 193 Wn.2d 860, 875 (2019): The PRA is to be liberally construed to promote access, and exemptions must be narrowly applied.\r\n\r\nTherefore, no additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this request. Any attempt to impose such a requirement would be an unlawful restriction of rights under RCW 42.56.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 (Retention of Public Records) makes clear that public records are subject to retention schedules, and that unlawful destruction can constitute a crime.\r\n\r\nRCW 40.16.010 and RCW 40.16.020 criminalize the unlawful mutilation, destruction, or concealment of public records.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.100 expressly prohibits an agency from destroying any public record after a public records request has been made for that record, even if the record would otherwise be scheduled for lawful destruction.\r\n\r\nIn addition, agencies have heightened retention obligations when litigation is reasonably anticipated. Records potentially relevant to actual or anticipated litigation must be preserved until both the public records request and the litigation have been fully resolved.\r\n\r\nLegal Consequences of Premature Destruction\r\n\r\nIn Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989), the Court of Appeals held that an agency violates the Public Records Act and is subject to attorneys\u2019 fees and statutory penalties when it destroys responsive records after receiving a public records request.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, it is not a PRA violation if a record was destroyed prior to the agency\u2019s receipt of a request, provided the destruction was lawful under retention schedules. See Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have emphasized that the Public Records Act (RCW 42.56) and the state\u2019s records retention laws (RCW 40.14) are separate but complementary. Agencies must comply with both.\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nYour agency must preserve all potentially responsive records immediately upon receipt of this request.\r\n\r\nNo responsive records may be altered, deleted, or destroyed until this request has been fully resolved and any related litigation has been lifted.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful destruction of responsive records may expose the agency and its officials to criminal liability (RCW 40.16), civil penalties, and mandatory attorneys\u2019 fees (RCW 42.56.550(4)).\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Please do not use third-party portals that require creating an account or logging in. A single or series of .zip files is fine.\r\n\r\nIf any records cannot be produced in the above formats, please produce them in their native format with associated metadata intact.\r\n\r\n3) Metadata Requested\r\n\r\nWhere reasonably available, please include customary metadata fields such as: From, To, CC, BCC, Subject, Sent/Received Date-Time (with timezone/UTC), Message-ID, Conversation/Thread-ID, file names, file sizes, hash values (if held), and folder/location paths.\r\n\r\n4) Search Details & Preservation\r\n\r\nPlease identify the systems searched (Exchange/Outlook/Office 365, Teams, mobile devices, MDM archives, JustFOIA/CivicPlus admin, helpdesk, file shares) and the custodians.\r\n\r\nPlease describe the search methods/terms used.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive sources were not searched or are no longer available, please explain why and what preservation steps were taken.\r\n\r\n5) Withholding, Redaction, and Exemptions\r\n\r\nIf you withhold or redact anything, identify the specific exemption under RCW 42.56 and provide a brief written explanation of how it applies to each withheld/redacted portion (RCW 42.56.210(3)). Please produce all segregable portions. For any records withheld in full, please provide an exemption/withholding log describing: date, author/recipient (to the extent disclosable), subject or general description, format, page count, and the precise exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\n6) Installments & Estimates\r\n\r\nPlease provide:\r\n\r\nAn initial acknowledgment within five business days (RCW 42.56.520) with a reasonable time estimate for each installment, and\r\n\r\nA cost estimate if fees are anticipated (please itemize and explain).\r\n\r\nNISSEN AFFIDAVIT AND ALL DEVICE SEARCH REQUIRED\r\n\r\nPursuant to Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863 (2015), and its progeny, this request specifically includes all responsive public records contained on personal devices or personal accounts (including personal cell phones, text/SMS/MMS, personal email accounts, cloud storage, instant messaging apps, and social media accounts) of any agency employee, official, or contractor where public business may have been conducted.\r\n\r\nTo comply with this requirement, please:\r\n\r\nConduct a comprehensive all-device search, including both agency-issued and personally owned devices/accounts used for public business.\r\n\r\nRequire each potentially responsive custodian to execute a Nissen affidavit or sworn certification affirming:\r\n\r\nThat they conducted a diligent search of all personal and agency devices/accounts reasonably likely to contain responsive records;\r\n\r\nThe methods used to conduct the search (e.g., search terms, accounts checked, device types); and\r\n\r\nWhether any responsive records were located, preserved, and produced.\r\n\r\nProduce all responsive records located in such searches along with the executed affidavits.\r\n\r\nFailure to obtain and provide sworn Nissen affidavits or equivalent certifications from custodians may constitute an incomplete search in violation of RCW 42.56.520 (requirement for a reasonable and adequate search) and may expose the agency to relief under RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDIGITAL COMPRESSION AND FILE MINIMIZATION REQUESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.080(2), please provide all responsive electronic records in the fewest number of individual files, preserving native formats wherever possible. Where appropriate, please use free digital compression (.zip or equivalent) to consolidate responsive records into the smallest number of installments for efficiency and economy.\r\n\r\nThis approach reduces agency burden, promotes prompt disclosure, and minimizes potential costs to the requestor, consistent with the Public Records Act\u2019s directive that agencies provide records in the most \u201creasonably locatable form\u201d and \u201cfullest assistance to requestors.\u201d See RCW 42.56.100 (agency duty to adopt reasonable rules for providing fullest assistance); RCW 42.56.120(2)(b) (fees must reflect actual costs, not used to discourage access).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have consistently held that agencies must facilitate access in a practical, non-burdensome manner. See Fisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014) (agencies must provide records in a usable format when reasonably feasible); Mechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009) (PRA is to be liberally construed in favor of disclosure). Producing consolidated, digitally compressed files satisfies these obligations by reducing unnecessary fragmentation and excess per-page charges.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I request that each installment be produced as a single compressed .zip file (or as few as technically necessary), containing all responsive records in native format, to ensure both compliance with RCW 42.56 and an economical calculation of any applicable public records fees.\r\n\r\nUSE OF THIRD PARTY PORTALS NOT MANDATORY\r\n\r\nPlease note that under Washington\u2019s Public Records Act, use of a third-party \u201cportal\u201d is not mandatory for requestors. Agencies may not condition access to records on the creation of an account, the use of a login, or the acceptance of third-party vendor terms.\r\n\r\nThird-party portals (such as GovQA, NextRequest, JustFOIA, or similar systems) often:\r\n\r\nRequire account creation or login credentials;\r\n\r\nRestrict downloads, viewing times, or re-access;\r\n\r\nRemove or disable links after a limited period;\r\n\r\nPlace records behind commercial platforms operated by for-profit corporations.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions unlawfully burden and condition access to public records. The Public Records Act forbids agencies from imposing access barriers beyond those authorized by statute.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080(2): An agency \u201cshall not deny a request for identifiable public records solely on the basis that the request is overbroad.\u201d Agencies must provide the \u201cfullest assistance\u201d and \u201cmost timely possible action\u201d to requestors.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.550(1): Courts are directed to liberally construe the PRA to ensure access and strictly construe exemptions against withholding.\r\n\r\nFisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014): Agencies must produce records in a \u201creasonably usable format when feasible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009): PRA is to be liberally construed in favor of disclosure and cannot be restricted by agency practices.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I respectfully decline use of any third-party portal. Please provide all responsive records via:\r\n\r\nDirect electronic email attachment to this requestor\u2019s address, or\r\n\r\nA direct, open (no password, no registration required) cloud-based download link hosted by your agency.\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION ON THIRD PARTY VENDORS\r\n\r\nDo not register this requestor with, nor direct this requestor to, any third-party commercial portal, including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA (a Granicus Corporation), NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA, FOIADirect, or any similar online service.\r\n\r\nDo not transmit any portion of this request, or responsive records, to any for-profit vendor or portal. Doing so would unlawfully condition access to public records and contravene both RCW 42.56.080 and RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being submitted via email, consistent with Washington\u2019s Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080(2) provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\u201cAgencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency\u2019s normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency-provided form or web page.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nA request submitted by email is a valid, enforceable method of making a PRA request.\r\n\r\nAgencies may recommend, but cannot require, the use of an online portal or official form.\r\n\r\nAny refusal to honor this request as submitted would directly conflict with RCW 42.56.080 and the agency\u2019s duty under RCW 42.56.100 to provide the \u201cfullest assistance to requestors\u201d and adopt reasonable rules that do not \u201cunreasonably hinder or delay\u201d access.\r\n\r\nWashington courts have emphasized that the PRA must be liberally construed in favor of disclosure and access, and that agencies cannot impose unauthorized barriers:\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009) (\u201cThe PRA is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure of public records.\u201d).\r\n\r\nFisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014) (records must be produced in a reasonably usable format when feasible).\r\n\r\nNissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863, 875 (2015) (the PRA is to be interpreted liberally to promote access and accountability).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this request is to be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email, as submitted. Should the agency fail to process this request in compliance with statute, relief will be sought pursuant to RCW 42.56.550 in the form of judicial review, penalties, and attorney\u2019s fees.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log. \r\n\r\nThe log must:\r\n\r\n* Identify the valid legal reason (statutory citation) for each exemption;\r\n* Specify the location of each redaction within the record produced (via footnote, coded reference, or margin notation);\r\n* State the number of pages or records withheld in their entirety, if any; and\r\n* Demonstrate that only the **minimal exempt portion** of any record has been withheld, as required by law.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Public Records Act requires agencies to justify each withholding or redaction:\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.210(3): \u201cAgency responses refusing, in whole or in part, inspection of any public record shall include a statement of the specific exemption authorizing the withholding of the record (or part) and a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record withheld.\u201d\r\nRCW 42.56.210(1): Exemptions must be narrowly construed.\r\n\r\nWashington courts have repeatedly enforced this duty:\r\n\r\nRental Housing Ass\u2019n of Puget Sound v. City of Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 538 (2009): Agencies must provide specific explanations for each exemption; conclusory or vague justifications are insufficient.\r\nSanders v. State*, 169 Wn.2d 827, 845 (2010): \u201cThe burden of proof is on the agency to establish that refusal to permit public inspection and copying is in accordance with a statute.\u201d\r\nResident Action Council v. Seattle Housing Auth.* 177 Wn.2d 417, 433 (2013): Agencies must disclose the non-exempt portions*of records and cannot withhold more than necessary.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request that your agency provide an itemized exemption log with each installment of records produced, in compliance with RCW 42.56.210(3) and the above case law, ensuring transparency and accountability in the redaction process.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nCommercial Purpose Declaration\r\n\r\nThis public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose. The Washington State Public Records Act (PRA) prohibits agencies from disclosing \u201clists of individuals\u201d for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.070(8) states:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency to give, sell, or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nThis request does not seek a \u201clist of individuals.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is not made for any commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThis declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56.070(8) regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nWarning: The PRA does not authorize agencies to require requestors to complete additional \u201ccommercial purpose declarations\u201d when the request does not seek a list of individuals. Such requirements improperly condition access to public records in violation of RCW 42.56.080(2) (requests must be honored by mail or email, no official format required) and RCW 42.56.100 (agencies must provide the fullest assistance to requestors and may not adopt rules that unreasonably hinder or delay access).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have consistently rejected agency attempts to impose conditions not found in statute:\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009): The PRA is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure; agencies cannot erect unauthorized barriers.\r\n\r\nSEIU 925 v. University of Washington, 193 Wn.2d 860, 875 (2019): The PRA is to be liberally construed to promote access, and exemptions must be narrowly applied.\r\n\r\nTherefore, no additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this request. Any attempt to impose such a requirement would be an unlawful restriction of rights under RCW 42.56.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 (Retention of Public Records) makes clear that public records are subject to retention schedules, and that unlawful destruction can constitute a crime.\r\n\r\nRCW 40.16.010 and RCW 40.16.020 criminalize the unlawful mutilation, destruction, or concealment of public records.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.100 expressly prohibits an agency from destroying any public record after a public records request has been made for that record, even if the record would otherwise be scheduled for lawful destruction.\r\n\r\nIn addition, agencies have heightened retention obligations when litigation is reasonably anticipated. Records potentially relevant to actual or anticipated litigation must be preserved until both the public records request and the litigation have been fully resolved.\r\n\r\nLegal Consequences of Premature Destruction\r\n\r\nIn Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989), the Court of Appeals held that an agency violates the Public Records Act and is subject to attorneys\u2019 fees and statutory penalties when it destroys responsive records after receiving a public records request.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, it is not a PRA violation if a record was destroyed prior to the agency\u2019s receipt of a request, provided the destruction was lawful under retention schedules. See Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have emphasized that the Public Records Act (RCW 42.56) and the state\u2019s records retention laws (RCW 40.14) are separate but complementary. Agencies must comply with both.\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nYour agency must preserve all potentially responsive records immediately upon receipt of this request.\r\n\r\nNo responsive records may be altered, deleted, or destroyed until this request has been fully resolved and any related litigation has been lifted.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful destruction of responsive records may expose the agency and its officials to criminal liability (RCW 40.16), civil penalties, and mandatory attorneys\u2019 fees (RCW 42.56.550(4)).\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Any records pertaining to a patrol between August 11-15, 2025, at Lamont St. NW and Mt. Pleasant St. SW, in Washington, D.C., which is depicted in these videos: https://bsky.app/profile/alexkoma.bsky.social/post/3lwhguqpsb22r and https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828.\r\n\r\n2. Any photographs, audio, or video captured by the law enforcement officials or employees during the above-mentioned patrol. This includes all raw and unedited video recorded by the device used to record this video (https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828) on the date that video (i.e., https://x.com/icegov/status/1957210426111930828) was recorded.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(ii) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the federal government's removal of a banner in a public park during a patrol of Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest, as exemplified by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's decision to publicize the video on its official social media account and by news coverage of the event.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/dmv-immigration/mount-pleasant-ice-immigration-federal-takeover-trump-donald-dc-washington/65-b6bfbde6-030d-41e7-8c46-4f0b96944a3a\r\nb. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/dmv-immigration/ice-immigration-dc-washington-mount-pleasant/65-d3517d58-d9e1-4f47-974b-e8ad4575a4d4\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by law enforcement officers with the approval of officials at the Department of Homeland Security and/or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

Oregon law provides that a public body may provide a full or partial fee waiver for information provided in response to a public records request if fulfilling the request would serve the public interest by primarily benefiting the general public. Lane County considers all factors set out in the Attorney General's Public Records and Meetings Manual and relevant legal authorities in reviewing individual requests for fee waivers, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n* The extent of time, expense, and interference with the Department's regular business, including financial hardship on the County;\r\n\r\n* The volume of the record(s) requested;\r\n\r\n* The necessity to segregate exempt from non-exempt materials; and/or\r\n\r\n* The extent to which the record requested does not further the public interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease provide answers to the following questions to assist us in evaluating your fee waiver/reduction request. If your request contains sub-parts, respond to the questions below with respect to each sub-part, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Provide general background/mission information on the requesting individual/group/organization as this information relates to public records requests from the County.\r\n\r\n* Describe the purpose for which you intend to use the information/records requested.\r\n\r\n* Describe your plans and ability to disseminate the information to the general public.\r\n\r\n* Explain how your use of the records requested will benefit the general public.\r\n\r\n* Explain any individual and/or private benefit derived from the disclosure of the records.\r\n\r\n* Explain how disclosure of the records would serve a commercial purpose, if any.\r\n\r\n* Provide any information that would help us evaluate your ability to pay any fees for fulfilling this request.\r\n\r\n* Provide any other information you feel would be valuable in evaluating this fee reduction/waiver request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLane County Public Records\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at Lane County, OR.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>\n",

Scope: I request records sufficient to identify all surveillance technologies, products, and services acquired, licensed, or subscribed to by the Eugene Police Department (EPD) or on EPD\u2019s behalf, whether funded by EPD or other City departments or grants. Definitions: Surveillance technology: Any device, system, software, or service primarily used to monitor, collect, analyze, or share information about individuals, vehicles, or their activities. This includes fixed or mobile systems, cloud services, analytics, and data-sharing platforms. Examples (non-exhaustive): - Automated license plate readers (ALPR) and related analytics; - Fixed CCTV and video management systems; vehicle/in-car and body-worn cameras and any automated analysis modules (e.g., object/face/weapon detection, transcription); - Drones/UAS and payloads; pole or trailer-mounted cameras; mobile surveillance platforms; - Facial recognition or other biometric systems (fingerprint/AFIS, iris, voice); image/video analytics; \u201creal-time crime center\u201d platforms; - Audio/acoustic systems (e.g., gunshot detection) and other sensor networks; - Social media monitoring/OSINT tools; web scraping; keyword/geo-fencing analytics; - Cell-site simulators and related tooling; device location tracking services; forensic extraction/analysis tools (e.g., mobile device/computer forensics); - Data broker and investigative intelligence subscriptions (e.g., commercial person-locator, vehicle, or identity data); information-sharing systems with external agencies; portals that aggregate criminal justice data. Exclusions (to narrow burden): Routine office IT and productivity tools (e.g., email, word processing, endpoint antivirus) are excluded unless they include surveillance-specific modules or analytics used as described above. Scope: 1) Technology and software inventories 1.1) Any current or historical inventories, registries, or lists that identify EPD\u2019s hardware, software, platforms, or cloud services, including: - Software/subscription inventories or SaaS/license lists; - Fixed-asset registers for surveillance or public safety equipment; - Camera registries or maps (fixed, mobile, trailer-mounted, or vendor-hosted); - \u201cSystem of record\u201d or application portfolio lists maintained by EPD or City IT. 1.2) For each entry, please include, where maintained: system name, vendor, product/module, deployment dates, quantity, status (active/inactive), data types collected, internal owner/custodian, and funding source. Preferred format: CSV/Excel. 2) Policies and inventories prepared for oversight that describe surveillance-related systems including: - Technology inventories - \u201cSurveillance impact reports\u201d - Privacy impact assessments - Data protection impact assessments (DPIA) - Data governance catalogs - CJIS system listings Custodians and forwarding: - This request likely involves EPD, City IT, City Procurement/Finance (contracts, POs, and vendor payments), and the City Attorney (agreements and data-sharing). - If EPD does not hold all records, please forward this request to the appropriate custodians and advise.

Preferred Format: - Please provide records electronically via email or secure download. - Lists and ledgers in CSV/Excel. - Contracts and documents in searchable PDF. Fee Waiver Request: I request a fee waiver under ORS 192.324(5) because disclosure primarily benefits the public by informing community understanding of surveillance-based enforcement and public impact. I am requesting these records for noncommercial purposes and intend to make the results publicly available. These records will be actively shared and used by community groups throughout Eugene. If fees will exceed $50, please provide a written cost estimate and do not proceed without confirmation. If any portions are withheld or redacted, please produce all segregable nonexempt material and cite the specific statutory basis for each withholding. If no records exist for a category, please say so. If any part of this request is considered overly broad, please contact me to discuss reasonable narrowing. Please contact me if you have questions Sincerely, Seth May \r\n  \r\n We are still reviewing your request to determine if we have responsive records and whether there will be fees associated with this request. City staff will be in contact with you within the next two weeks. \r\n  \r\n Thank you, \r\n  \r\n Eugene Police Department\r\n300 Country Club Rd\r\nEugene, Oregon 97401\r\n541-682-5185\r\nEPD_PUBLIC_RECORDS_OFFICE@ci.eugene.or.us \r\n  \r\n _______________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nPowered by",
