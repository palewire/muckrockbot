These email addresses recently appeared on a publicly disclosed email thread that included the Arizona Secretary of State's staff and a CISA employee, requesting the censorship of several Tweets.  The fact that CISA appears to be involved in this behavior is concerning, and raises questions about government integrity.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAFL",
