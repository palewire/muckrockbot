The contact information of enrolled students (including their cell phone numbers and email addresses) is a matter of public record. Under FERPA, it is considered \u201cdirectory information,\u201d along with other basic information like the student\u2019s email, major, dates of attendance and enrollment status. It is common for entities that want to advertise to students to request this publicly available contact information \u2014 everything from apartment complexes, to credit cards, to political candidates and so there is no exemption that will prevent release of this information unless individual cadets specifically sign a statement to have their information \u201cwithheld.\u201d Under federal law, directory information is not considered private unless students opt to withhold it from public disclosure.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",
