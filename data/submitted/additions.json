I am 68 years old and I am unemployed an in a dire economic situation. I lost $80,000.00 via a cyber crime given my vulnerabilities. I immediately reported this scam to the FBI via their IC3 website. I never had the courtesy of a single response from the FBI since I filed that case of online theft. Not a single response. It's fairly obvious to me that absolutely nothing was investigated. I now suffer from memory loss and cardio vascular disease. I have identified a private company which is willing to investigate this scam on my behalf. I am not optimistic that I will recover any funds given the elapsed timeframe. However, I need to try. I really thought the FBI will act given the amount of money I lost.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEarl James Gobin",
