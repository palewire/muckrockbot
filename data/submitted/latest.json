The death was profiled in a BuzzFeed article titled: \"The Strange Case of the Russian Diplomat Who Got His Head Smashed In On Election Day.\" News coverage implied that the circumstances around this individual and the death were more mysterious than the Russian government claimed and that it resembled other deaths of Russian individuals in the same time frame. \r\n\r\nThe election day 2016 death of Sergei Kirvov received limited and measured news coverage from mainstream news sources. It additionally spread in a more conspiratorial manner on social media in the weeks after the 2016 election. Most of the news coverage of the death was in the months following election day. Please limit the search, naturally, to between November 8th 2016 and January 20th of 2017. \r\n\r\nSearch terms:\r\n\"Sergei Kirvov\"\r\n\"Sergey Kirvov\"\r\n\"Cergej Kirvov\"\r\n\"Russian consular employee death\"\r\n\r\nIf there is not NSC Correspondence about this death or news coverage or social media chatter about the death, then publicly say so and close the request. \r\n\r\nNews coverage for context: \r\nhttps://nypost.com/2016/11/08/dead-man-with-head-trauma-found-at-russian-consulate/\r\nhttps://zakonbase.ru/content/part/293588\r\nhttps://www.rferl.org/a/russian-embassy-guard-found-dead-new-york-no-foul-play-suspected/28105096.html\r\n\r\nThank you for the Obama Presidential library for the commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The other schools we\u2019re contacting for data to use in the trends analysis found that helpful as when we get the data from multiple sources it needs to end up being \u201capples to apples\u201d.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe overall purpose of the project is to do a comparative analysis of admissions for Peer or near-peer colleges and university to identify trends that may impact planning and execution of admissions strategies and goals. To that end we need not only the student demographics, but the application and admissions timelines.\r\n\r\nFor example. If the majority of applicants do not make their decision on completing the application or accepting the offer to attend until shortly before a matriculation date that creates a serious planning issue for Institutions like VMI who have to plan for a wide range and do not have sufficient reaction time to implement mitigations strategies. This would be of benefit to many colleges as we do not believe such analysis is ongoing.\r\n\r\nIn VMI\u2019s case there was one year where it appears due to COVID and other factors enrollment (those who matriculated) was extremely low. If the perspective students did not notify VMI until shortly before (or just did not show up) it puts the school in a bind to provide opportunities to others and, more importantly, may have left some good potential students without sufficient time to react and arrive to matriculate.\r\n\r\nIt is one goal to see what the trend is for today\u2019s freshmen on when they make the decisions and what visibility schools have of that.\r\n\r\nAcademic years covered:\r\n\r\n2015 - 2016\r\n2016 - 2017\r\n2017 - 2018\r\n2018 - 2019\r\n2019 - 2020\r\n2020 - 2021\r\n2021 - 2022\r\n2022 - 2023\r\n2023 - 2024\r\n2024 - 2025\r\n\r\nREQUEST 1: An excel or .CSV file of the entire SSR database (report) as provided in the last FOIA with all fields, except for PII and an explanation of the field codes.\r\n\r\nThis would be the best as it would require little to no level of effort on VMI\u2019s part to simply export the entire file(s) without any PII fields. \r\n\r\nWe respectfully request this as it may have some fields we do not know exist in the report/database that could be valuable in our research.\r\n\r\nALETRNATE: If it is not possible to just provide files of the entire database (minus PII) we request the following.\r\n\r\n1.\tA list of all SSR codes and their meaning for all fields in the SSR Database.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe breakout of ALL applicants to VMI by race, ethnicity, gender, and within each of those, which were athletes and non-athletes:\r\n\r\na.\tDate of initial contact\r\nb.\tDate of Initial Application\r\nc.\tDate of full application competition\r\nd.\tDate Accepted or Declined by VMI (i.e. Appointment or denied appointment)\r\ne.\tDate of partial deposit\r\nf.\tDate of full deposit\r\ng.\tDate CAD- cancelled after paying the deposit (but before becoming a full reservation)\r\nh.\tDate CBD- cancelled before paying the deposit\r\ni.\tDate CR- cancelled after becoming a full reservation (deposit paid and medicals approved)\r\nj.\tDate TDMD- appointed but medically disqualified\r\nk.\tDate MT- matriculated\r\nl.\tOther fields that will allow developing trends and profiles of the timeline between cadets applying to VMI and final disposition if they attend or not.\r\n\r\n3. The number and dollar value of each scholarship or tuition assistance for each MT cadet by race, ethnicity, gender, and within each of those, which were athletes and non-athletes, with the source of funding (e.g., VMI Agencies, Federal Government, VMI internal funds, other).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G. Callahan \r\nCustodian of Records \r\n \r\nLogin Link: https://mshp.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/Login.aspx",
