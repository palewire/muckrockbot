        "communication": "Dear Federal Aviation Administration:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. \r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nI am seeking records related to FAA's aviation education mascot, Air Bear.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design of the Air Bear mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to FWS's decision to create a mascot in the first place. (According to FAA records (attached), Air Bear was conceived of by Janice Draper of the Illinois Division of Aeronautics, and FAA adopted Air Bear as its official aviation education mascot in early 1989.) \r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Air Bear-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, videos, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books). (According to FAA records (attached), these records include coloring books, classroom materials, and a video called \"Air Bear Goes On A Trip.\")\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any life-size Air Bear costume (pictured in the attached FAA records). Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Air Bear.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all correspondence related to Air Bear (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn may have sent some responsive correspondence around 2007.\r\n\r\n6. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision by FAA to stop using Air Bear as part of its public outreach.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

        "communication": "Dear Records Access Officer:\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal of DOCCS's determination regarding FOIL request DOCCS-22-11-028 on May 25, 2023, as well as its determinations on April 11, 2023; March 6, 2023; January 19, 2023; and November 29, 2022. All of the determinations extended the time to respond to my request. According to the determinations, records \"potentially responsive to my request\" were identified at least as early as November 29, 2022, but have been \"under review for applicable exemptions, legal privileges and responsiveness.\"\r\n\r\nDOCCS has constructively denied my request. The repeated delays, which have now extended for more than seven months after I submitted the request on November 1, 2022, are unreasonable given the narrow scope of the request.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, OOM is required by law to provide specific reasons within 10 business days explaining why this request cannot be fulfilled in a timely manner, or else, must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by the specific date given beyond 20 business days, or if the specific date given is unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied (see \u00a789[4][a]). In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you either fulfill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial, as required by law, of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit\r\n\r\nView request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpuyallup-school-district-24536%252Fpuyallup-school-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2015-2021-120944%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicrecords%252540puyallup.k12.wa.us&url_auth_token=AAEh3NUBNXQtivDnsWNRI6OhLoI%3A1oHUUY%3AVb-6NK25tnkESluOrb0XN2wPb342XnNjDPWGaqJRUAQ\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nPJHCCWHC\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\u2022 2022-07-29_11_11_21-Sharing_Link_Validation__Mozilla_Firefox.png\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 120944-61229246@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120944\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit\r\n\r\nView request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpuyallup-school-district-24536%252Fpuyallup-school-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2015-2021-120944%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicrecords%252540puyallup.k12.wa.us&url_auth_token=AAEh3NUBNXQtivDnsWNRI6OhLoI%3A1oHUUY%3AVb-6NK25tnkESluOrb0XN2wPb342XnNjDPWGaqJRUAQ\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nPJHCCWHC\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\u2022 2022-07-29_11_11_21-Sharing_Link_Validation__Mozilla_Firefox.png\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 120944-61229246@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120944\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

In an email dated August 21, 2023, you agreed to accept copies of fiscal year 2021 and 2022 COPS Office FOIA Request logs. The logs will include (1) requester name; (2) date of request; (3) date request was closed; and (4) request disposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe completed our search for records responsive to your request.  We located 15 pages that may be responsive to your request.  I have determined that the enclosed pages are appropriate for release without redactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may contact the COPS Office FOIA Public Liaison at 202-514-1873 to discuss any aspect of your request. Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with my determination in response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website: https://www.justice.gov/oip/submit-and-track-request-or-appeal.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request.  If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like further information about the COPS Office, please visit our Internet site at https://www.cops.usdoj.gov.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNicole Lee\r\n\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\n",

        "communication": "Good morning Mr. Welsh,\r\n\r\nI am writing to you regarding the scope of your request. I have completed my review of DOI-OS-2023-001109. The responsive records consist of excel documents, some of which contain columns of PII (personally identifiable information). Because the PII columns contain some names and email addresses belonging to law enforcement officials, they must be redacted and sent to the Solicitor's office for further review, which could significantly increase the wait time for these records.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you are amenable to excluding the columns with PII from the responsive records, we could then release them to you immediately. The make, model, year, and identifiers of each drone would still be available in the responsive records. Would you be willing to exclude the columns of PII? Please let me know at your convenience so that I can move to either release the records (should you agree to remove columns with PII) or send the records for further review (if you wish to keep the columns with PII).\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D92BE6.FABDDE80]\r\nTim Turner\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nU.S. Department of the Interior\r\nOffice of the Secretary",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

The courts have been consistent that name, address, telephone number, and email addresses of public records requestors are NOT EXEMPT from disclosure. \r\n \r\n 1.\tYou have provided no exemption logs. Why are you redacting information? What exemptions are you claiming under the PRA?\r\n \r\n 2. You have transformed and modified these original records requested into new records with new filenames. You have created new records which was not requested. \r\n \r\n For instance, file \"LWSD-Muckrock_000163.pdf\" refers to a request including the following:\r\n \r\n \"Dear Mr. Boyd:\r\n \r\n Attached please find the records responsive for your May 11, 2015 request for:\r\n \r\n Access to and a copy of all data related to concussion incidents for high school athletes at all high schools in the district but at least Lake Washington High School for sports years 2004-2014. All data with columns related to date, sport, season, age, gender, days kept out, and any records associated with district recording related to the Lystedt Law CRCW.28A.600. 190.\"\r\n \r\n However no responsive records are attached. Another .pdf file in the installment does refer to concussion incident reports, however as a requestor I am not obligated to assume, guess, or infer that this file which was attached to a response to Mr. Bord's request, a file which you have extracted and renamed from the originally requested PRA response if it is in fact the original attachment. \r\n \r\n Additionally, missing  is Mr. Boyd's original public records request as well as others, however we are not given enough context to understand what is missing and what is not.\r\n\r\n3. What records does this \"installment 1\" represent? You provide no context, meanwhile Lake Washington School District has already provided multiple installments of records. This is certainly not \"Installment One.\" Please explain in detail. \r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records again as requested, unredacted or with the proper exemption logs and explanations of what records are being provided, what records are being withheld, and why. \r\n\r\n4. We understand that now the District is for the 4th time giving a new \"final\"  estimated completion date for this request as 02-28-2023 (modified from the original missed final estimated completion date of 07-15-2022 Originally Provided by the District on 11-21-21).\r\n\r\nThank you.",

So we can begin processing, please confirm for us what your requester category is - i.e., whether you are a commercial requester, news media, or individual.\r\n\r\nNote:  There are three categories of requesters: 1) Commercial; 2) educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, and representatives of the news media; and 3) all other requesters, including members of the general public.  The requester category bears on the amount of fees that might be assessed in processing your request.\r\n\r\nDefinitions of each requester category, and information on what fees (i.e., for search, review, and duplication) would be charged depending on the requester category can be found in our revised fee regulations found here:  https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f97c375521e692fad78c1a5f62893518&mc=true&node=se16.2.1015_19&rgn=div8\r\n\r\nPlease reply directly to me via email confirming your requester category, and provide sufficient information supporting your identification of the applicable requester category.

        "communication": "June 03, 2021 RE:\u00a0 USAID FOIA No. F-00189-21 (FOIA Specialist Assignment Email) Dear Mr. Boguslaw: This acknowledges receipt of your\u00a0June 02, 2021, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request\u00a0to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). \u00a0Specifically, you requested records concerning the last 200 pages of emails sent to, from, or copied to Samantha Power. You also requested a fee waiver. \r\nFee Waiver \r\nThe FOIA provides that fees should be waived or reduced if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u00a0 As a member of the media, the only applicable fee is duplication.\u00a0 Duplication is $0.10 per page, but the first 100 pages are free.\u00a0 After review of the fee waiver criteria, your fee waiver request is moot.\u00a0 Since the only applicable fee is duplication, and USAID routinely furnishes responsive records to FOIA requesters in electronic format, it's most likely there will be no duplication fees to assess. \r\nFOIA Specialist \r\nYour request has been assigned to Theresa Morris, Senior FOIA Specialist.\u00a0 You may contact Theresa Morris\u00a0by email at thmorris@usaid.gov or by phone on 202-921-5003. \u00a0Please reference the tracking number cited above in any future correspondence. \r\nExtending the FOIA\u2019s Time Limits due to Unusual Circumstances The FOIA provides that an agency \u00a0may extend its time limits when \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d occur\u00a0in the processing of a request. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i) (2016).  Those \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d are set forth in the statute, 5 U.S.C \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii), and are described as: 1) The need to search for records from field facilities or other locations separate from the office processing the request; 2) The need to search, collect and examine voluminous records; and 3) The need for consultation with another agency. Based upon the records you have requested, we have determined that one or more unusual circumstances will occur during the processing of your request.  Accordingly, your response time-limit has been extended beyond the 20 days required by statute; therefore, 10 additional processing days have been added to your request. To mitigate this action, you may limit the scope of the request so that it can be processed more quickly or to arrange an alternative time to respond. If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact the assigned FOIA Specialist noted above. You may also contact USAID\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, Christopher Colbow, at foia@usaid.gov. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services offered: Office of Government Information Services National Archives and Records Administration 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001 E-mail: ogis@nara.gov Telephone: 202-741-5770; Toll Free: 1-877-684-6448 Fax: 202-741-5769 Thank you for your interest in USAID.

I'm not in need of the individual documents associated with these corrections, just the penalty data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I am emailing today to request a correction related to published documents on this MuckRack database site in reference to Medical Facility Enforcement Actions from the Department of Health and Social Services:   https://www.muckrock.com/foi/delaware-236/medical-facility-enforcement-actions-144993/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe published file, titled \"FOIA Request CMP's Imposed\" contains inaccurate information. DHSS regretfully provided incorrect information in response to the FOIA request that led to the publication of a excel file listing facilities fined by the Delaware Division of Health Care Quality.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. McCall,\r\n\r\nThis is in response to your Freedom of Information Act request (23-11470)\r\nregarding any and all photos of the Surveyor 5 lunar lander. Your request\r\nwas received by our office on December 7, 2022.  Your request was also sent\r\nto the Still Pictures Branch; their office will respond separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request consists of a stated topic rather than describing specific\r\ndocuments, and therefore is not reasonably specific enough for us to be in\r\na position to easily locate documents responsive to your request.  Although\r\nour facility holds records created by NASA, they are not described at a\r\nlevel that would reasonably lead us to a particular series that would\r\ninclude the photographs you seek.  We recommend browsing the series that\r\nmention Surveyor here: Search Results for Surveyor in RG 255.\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/search?q=Surveyor&recordGroupNumber=255&levelOfDescription=series>\r\nIf you find records of interest, please reach out to\r\nArchives2Reference@nara.gov for information relating to availability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may also be helpful to reach out to the Records Officer for NASA to\r\ndetermine if Surveyor photographs were accessioned to a particular National\r\nArchives facility.  In your request, we recommend asking for both transfer\r\nand accession numbers.  Here is their contact information:\r\n\r\nPatti Stockman\r\n\r\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\r\n\r\nMail Code AO\r\n\r\n300 E Street SW\r\n\r\nWashington, DC 20546-0001\r\n\r\npatti.stockman@nasa.gov\r\n\r\n202-358-4787\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may also want to contact the NASA History Division\r\n<https://history.nasa.gov/> and the JPL Archives\r\n<https://jpl-nasa.libguides.com/archives>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this response a denial under the Freedom of Information\r\nAct because we cannot determine without more specific information whether\r\nthe records you have requested exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have the right to file an administrative appeal in writing via regular\r\nU.S. mail or email.

Your request\r\nwas received by our office on December 7, 2022.  Your request was also sent\r\nto the Still Pictures Branch; their office will respond separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request consists of a stated topic rather than describing specific\r\ndocuments, and therefore is not reasonably specific enough for us to be in\r\na position to easily locate documents responsive to your request.  Although\r\nour facility holds records created by NASA, they are not described at a\r\nlevel that would reasonably lead us to a particular series that would\r\ninclude the photographs you seek.  We recommend browsing the series that\r\nmention Surveyor here: Search Results for Surveyor in RG 255.\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/search?q=Surveyor&recordGroupNumber=255&levelOfDescription=series>\r\nIf you find records of interest, please reach out to\r\nArchives2Reference@nara.gov for information relating to availability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may also be helpful to reach out to the Records Officer for NASA to\r\ndetermine if Surveyor photographs were accessioned to a particular National\r\nArchives facility.  In your request, we recommend asking for both transfer\r\nand accession numbers.  Here is their contact information:\r\n\r\nPatti Stockman\r\n\r\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\r\n\r\nMail Code AO\r\n\r\n300 E Street SW\r\n\r\nWashington, DC 20546-0001\r\n\r\npatti.stockman@nasa.gov\r\n\r\n202-358-4787\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may also want to contact the NASA History Division\r\n<https://history.nasa.gov/> and the JPL Archives\r\n<https://jpl-nasa.libguides.com/archives>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this response a denial under the Freedom of Information\r\nAct because we cannot determine without more specific information whether\r\nthe records you have requested exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have the right to file an administrative appeal in writing via regular\r\nU.S. mail or email.  Your appeal should be received within ninety (90)\r\ncalendar days from the date of this letter and it should explain why you\r\nbelieve this response does not meet the requirements of the Freedom of\r\nInformation Act.  Please address it to the Deputy Archivist of the United\r\nStates (ND), National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi\r\nRoad, College Park, Maryland 20740.
