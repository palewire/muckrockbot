        "communication": "Dear Tinker Air Force Base:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nI am seeking records related to \"Captain Sentry,\" the mascot of the 552nd Air Control Wing.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design of Captain Sentry. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to the Air Force's decision to create the mascot in the first place.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Captain Sentry-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes that take the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, photographs, videos, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any wearable Captain Sentry Sentry costumes, such as the one depicted in the attached photo and at the following links: \r\nhttps://www.507arw.afrc.af.mil/News/Photos/igphoto/2003245926/ \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/552acw/posts/363945359110596/. \r\nResponsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Captain Sentry.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all correspondence related to Captain Sentry (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any Congressional member, office, committee, or staff. U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) may have sent some responsive correspondence around 2019.\r\n\r\n6. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision to stop using the Captain Sentry mascot.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically, by email attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",
