You seek the following: \r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny documents pertaining to collaboration between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the production of the 2009 movie \"Space Buddies,\" directed by Robert Vince and distributed by Disney. I request any and all documents pertaining to NASA support for \"Space Buddies.\" Such documents may include but should not be limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of NASA and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Space Buddies,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply.\r\n\r\nAttached to this request are three documents: (1) a list of NASA-supported TV and films productions spanning the years 2006-2015 (a list which includes \"Space Buddies\"); (2) a letter with the DCF letterhead for purposes of fee waiver; and (3) the 501c3 application and approval for the DCF.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I am requesting access to the following records in the possession of the National Archives and Record Administration (NARA):\r\n\r\nAll records related to Project Fantasia. Project Fantasia was a collaboration between the Office of Strategic Services (record group 226) and the Office of Scientific Research and Development (record group 227), and was assigned a project number of SAC-26. A 2016 article published by NARA in Prologue Magazine, titled \"Secret Weapons, Forgotten Sacrifices,\" contains a description of Project Fantasia and identifies some of the records as being in record group 227. It can be found here: https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2016/spring/office-scientific-research-development-world-war-ii\r\n\r\nPlease restrict your search for any records to record groups 226 and 227.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to review these records in-person, at your location in College Park, Maryland. If any of these records are being held at a facility other than the one in College Park, please notify me of this before processing the request.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please advise which tier of processing queue this request falls under and an estimated time frame for processing.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said destruction or transfer, to include but not be limited to confirmation that NARA has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
