Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

It is a requisite that the City Clerk's bond be duly filed with the Office of the Mayor. The current delay in the presentation of your bond raises substantial concerns. Under the prevailing municipal regulations, the absence of a properly executed and filed bond disqualifies an individual from holding the office of City Clerk. Persisting in occupying this position without the requisite bond may be construed as an unauthorized assumption of office, an act which carries serious legal implications. Immediate attention to this matter is strongly advised to ensure compliance with relevant statutory requirements and to uphold the integrity of the office.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nSeptember Baron\r\n\r\nSent from [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail/home) for iOS",

This role inherently positions you as a servant to the constituents you are sworn to serve, thereby establishing a relationship where the constituents are, in effect, the principals in this dynamic.\r\n\r\nThe premature termination of our call not only raises concerns regarding your commitment to these obligations but also poses a potential jeopardy to your tenure in office. It is imperative to highlight the necessity of immediate accessibility to the surety bonds, which, as per legal requirement, must be maintained on file for all city officials at all times. Failure to promptly furnish these documents upon request could potentially expose you, and by extension, the entire City Council, to significant legal repercussions.\r\n\r\nIt is critical to underscore that the operational framework of municipal governance, including the requirement for surety bonds, is grounded in the Constitution of the United States. This foundational document supersedes any state laws to the contrary, ensuring that no deviation from its mandates is permissible. The insistence on accessing these bonds is not subject to discretionary delay and must be addressed forthwith.\r\n\r\nAny attempt to rationalize a delay or non-compliance is unacceptable and necessitates immediate scrutiny. Should there be any failure to comply with these constitutional requirements, it may be requisite to bring this matter to the attention of higher judicial authorities, including the Supreme Court, to review the practices of the City of Aliso Viejo. Such actions are necessary to ensure adherence to the constitutional directives governing the conduct and obligations of city officials at all levels.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nSeptember Baron\r\n\r\nSent from [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail/home) for iOS",

        "communication": "Dear Mitzi,\r\n\r\nI am writing to address a matter concerning the same letter I received nearly two years ago, which pertains to my public records request. I am perplexed as to why this letter was referenced in response to my recent inquiry for all city officials' oaths and bonds. My understanding is that there is no limitation on the number of public records requests I am entitled to submit. Therefore, I seek to clarify and expand my current request under the relevant public records law.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I wish to express my concerns regarding the prolonged period it has taken to fulfill my existing request, which has now extended over a year and a half. Given this delay, I believe it is within my rights to amend my request to include additional documents, specifically the bonds of all city officials and sheriff\u2019s. Which was not part of my original submission. In my original request #15 is where I\u2019ve requested all city officials Oaths.\r\n\r\nI would like to formally request that the aforementioned documents included. It is my hope that this matter can be resolved promptly and efficiently, in accordance with the law governing public records requests.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nSeptember Baron\r\n\r\nSent from [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail/home) for iOS",

As as a long-standing resident of Aliso Viejo since its foundation.  I have the right to inform you that its imperative, given your tenure that you be apprised of these exchanges and the grave concerns they encapsulate, which could potentially implicate the entire City Council of Aliso Viejo.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to acknowledge the illicit conduct currently permeating our city, notably involving personnel from the local sheriff's department. I urge you to consider the gravity of my assertions with utmost seriousness, as any further disregard for my petitions may precipitate severe legal consequences for the municipality, including yourself as the Mayor. My prior attempts to communicate through voicemail and email have been met with an unsettling silence, devoid of any recognition or response. This lack of engagement does not befit the responsibilities assumed by those who have pledged to serve the public interest.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the city council to engage with the citizenry, who provide the financial support for their positions, starkly contradicts the ethos of public service. As the Mayor and other municipal officials, you have sworn an oath to serve\u2014 a commitment I, as a citizen, have not undertaken. This oath entails a duty to the populace, a duty flagrantly breached when my attempts to exercise my constitutional rights are dismissed or ignored by city staff, including the receptionist and the city clerk.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I demand immediate action to address these concerns, which not only merit but may necessitate judicial scrutiny at the highest level, including potential review by the Supreme Court, to assess the city's adherence to the Constitution of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, \r\nSeptember Baron\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember Baron\r\n\r\n\r\nSent from Proton Mail for iOS\"",

As as a long-standing resident of Aliso Viejo since its foundation.  I have the right to inform you that its imperative, given your tenure that you be apprised of these exchanges and the grave concerns they encapsulate, which could potentially implicate the entire City Council of Aliso Viejo.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to acknowledge the illicit conduct currently permeating our city, notably involving personnel from the local sheriff's department. I urge you to consider the gravity of my assertions with utmost seriousness, as any further disregard for my petitions may precipitate severe legal consequences for the municipality, including yourself as the Mayor. My prior attempts to communicate through voicemail and email have been met with an unsettling silence, devoid of any recognition or response. This lack of engagement does not befit the responsibilities assumed by those who have pledged to serve the public interest.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the city council to engage with the citizenry, who provide the financial support for their positions, starkly contradicts the ethos of public service. As the Mayor and other municipal officials, you have sworn an oath to serve\u2014 a commitment I, as a citizen, have not undertaken. This oath entails a duty to the populace, a duty flagrantly breached when my attempts to exercise my constitutional rights are dismissed or ignored by city staff, including the receptionist and the city clerk.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I demand immediate action to address these concerns, which not only merit but may necessitate judicial scrutiny at the highest level, including potential review by the Supreme Court, to assess the city's adherence to the Constitution of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, \r\nSeptember Baron\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember Baron\"",

        "communication": "Attached is information you requested from the Clark County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner. Please note this list will only include cases where the decedent has been identified and their legal next of kin has been notified. It is important to note that this report is based on preliminary information received by the Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner and will only include deaths the coroner\u2019s office investigated in which we could not identify a place of residence for the decedent. For this reason, the report could include individuals who were not homeless. Also, this report does not include deaths that were not investigated by the coroner\u2019s office. For example, a homeless individual who was hospitalized for some time before his or her death, and so was under the care of a doctor, would not be on this list. You may want to check with the Southern Nevada Health District if you haven\u2019t done so already to see what additional data it may be able to provide. Additionally, your request for autopsy records of all individuals who passed away from 2018-2022, poses significant challenges for our office. It would entail staff having to manually pull over a thousand reports and then redacting confidential information that is not subject to state public records laws. Such a request would take us many months to process. Please let me know if the attached information satisfies your request. If there are some specific cases you are interested in receiving more information about, please let me know which ones and I will check with the Coroner\u2019s Office on an estimated time to provide the records and any related costs.",

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Gallagher,\r\n\r\nPlease forgive my delay in replying to your November 2 response (attached) to my Pubic Records Act request. I was considering how best to respond.\r\n\r\nRegarding #3 of my request, which was for deployment records, we understand that \"deployment\" may be defined differently in different contexts. We are seeking records of when the equipment was brought out into the public or in an operation (i.e., not for training). \r\n\r\nWe also understand that some agencies only keep records of such deployment when there is a use of force involved, in which case any other type of deployment would have a \"no responsive records\" finding. \r\n\r\nRegarding #1 and #2 of my request, which were for purchase records of certain equipment used by Modesto PD, I would like to amend my request to seek the following:\r\nInventory records of equipment in Modesto PD's possession, if any, for the following types of equipment, for which new state legislation requires publication of information:\r\n\r\n(1) Unmanned, remotely piloted, powered aerial or ground vehicles.\r\n(2) Mine-resistant ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicles or armored personnel carriers. However, police versions of standard consumer vehicles are specifically excluded from this subdivision.\r\n(3) High mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles (HMMWV), commonly referred to as Humvees, two and one-half-ton trucks, five-ton trucks, or wheeled vehicles that have a breaching or entry apparatus attached. However, unarmored all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and motorized dirt bikes are specifically excluded from this subdivision.\r\n(4) Tracked armored vehicles that provide ballistic protection to their occupants and utilize a tracked system instead of wheels for forward motion.\r\n(5) Command and control vehicles that are either built or modified to facilitate the operational control and direction of public safety units.\r\n(6) Weaponized aircraft, vessels, or vehicles of any kind.\r\n(7) Battering rams, slugs, and breaching apparatuses that are explosive in nature. However, items designed to remove a lock, such as bolt cutters, or a handheld ram designed to be operated by one person, are specifically excluded from this subdivision.\r\n(8) Firearms of .50 caliber or greater. However, standard issue shotguns are specifically excluded from this subdivision.\r\n(9) Ammunition of .50 caliber or greater. However, standard issue shotgun ammunition is specifically excluded from this subdivision.\r\n(10) Specialized firearms and ammunition of less than .50 caliber, including assault weapons as defined in Sections 30510 and 30515 of the Penal Code, with the exception of standard issue service weapons and ammunition of less than .50 caliber that are issued to officers, agents, or employees of a law enforcement agency or a state agency.\r\n(11) Any firearm or firearm accessory that is designed to launch explosive projectiles.\r\n(12) \u201cFlashbang\u201d grenades and explosive breaching tools, \u201ctear gas,\u201d and \u201cpepper balls,\u201d excluding standard, service-issued handheld pepper spray.\r\n(13) Taser Shockwave, microwave weapons, water cannons, and the Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD).\r\n(14) The following projectile launch platforms and their associated munitions: 40mm projectile launchers, \u201cbean bag,\u201d rubber bullet, and specialty impact munition (SIM) weapons.\r\n\r\nPlease include equipment that may be assigned to or designated for use by special units or jails.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the above list of types of equipment is taken verbatim from legislation enacted on September 30, 2021 (AB 481, see https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB481). This legislation will require all police departments and sheriff offices in California to publish use policies by May 1, 2022 that include, for each type of equipment named above that the agency has acquired and seeks to continue to use, \"a description of each type of military equipment, the quantity [acquired], its capabilities, expected lifespan, and product descriptions from the manufacturer of the military equipment.\" The legislation requires that agencies publish this information on their web sites and submit the information to local city councils or boards of supervisors.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the legislature has determined that information on the number and description of these articles possessed by law enforcement agencies in California is not exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act. While responding to this request may require some staff time, we understand that AB 481 will require this and other work from the department in the coming months. \r\n\r\nI appreciate your efforts in response to this request. \r\n\r\nbest,\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland\r\n\r\n",

In response to number 2 of your request, the FOIA Office was able to locate 5 letters out of the list of schools you provided. Those letters are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Please be advised that certain student and parent/guardian information was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(j)(iii) exempts from release information concerning a school or university\u2019s adjudication of student disciplinary cases, but only to the extent that disclosure would unavoidably reveal the identity of the student. Section 7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) FOIA office received your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, dated 01/05/2023, and assigned it control number DOI-FWS-2023-001711. Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request. The FOIA requires that requests describe the records sought with sufficient detail to allow an agency employee familiar with the subject area of the request to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort.\u202f The FWS does not have a central record repository. As such your request would require each office in the FWS to conduct a manual search for records you have requested. This type of search would place inordinate burden on the FWS's resources. If you wish to pursue your request, please include specific information about the records sought, including the office (s) you believe may have responsive records. In general, the more specific the request describes the records sought, the greater likelihood we will be able to locate those records. According to our regulations, if we do not receive your written response clarifying what records you are looking for within 20 workdays from the date of this letter, we will presume that you are no longer interested in pursuing your request, we will not be able to comply with your request, and we will close our file on it. See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.5(d).\u202f You may seek assistance from us or the Department's FOIA Public Liaison as described below. Mediation/Dispute Resolution  You may contact us at fwhq_foia@fws.gov for assistance with your request.\u00a0 If after contacting us, you need further information or assistance with your request, you may wish to seek dispute resolution services from the Department\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, Natasha Jones by email at doifoiapublicliaison@sol.doi.gov.  If you need further information or assistance after contacting the Department\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, you may wish to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS). The 2007 FOIA amendments created the OGIS to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.\u202f Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.\u202f You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways: Office of Government Information Services National Archives and Records Administration 8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS College Park, MD 20740-6001 E-mail: ogis@nara.gov Web: https://www.archives.gov/ogis  Telephone: 202-741-5770 Fax: 202-741-5769 Toll-free: 1-877-684-6448 Please note that using OGIS services does not affect the timing of filing an appeal with the Department\u2019s FOIA & Privacy Act Appeals Officer. Appeal Rights You may also file an appeal with the Department\u2019s FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer regarding this response. If you choose to appeal, the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer must receive your FOIA appeal no later than 90 workdays from the date of this communication.\u202f Appeals arriving or delivered after 5 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, will be deemed received on the next workday. Your appeal must be made in writing.\u202f You may submit your appeal and accompanying materials to the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer by mail, courier service, fax, or email.\u202f All communications concerning your appeal should be clearly marked with the words: \"FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL.\"\u202f You must include an explanation of why you believe this response is in error.\u202f You must also include with your appeal copies of all correspondence between you and FWS concerning your FOIA request, including your original FOIA request and this response.\u202f Failure to include with your appeal all correspondence between you and FWS will result in the Department's rejection of your appeal, unless the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer determines (in the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer\u2019s sole discretion) that good cause exists to accept the defective appeal. Please include your name and daytime telephone number (or the name and telephone number of an appropriate contact), email address and fax number (if available) in case the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer needs additional information or clarification of your appeal.

Fee Category and Fee \r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the news media.\u00a0 As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free. See .\u00a0 If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.

Specifically, I am interested in any technology documentation (including but not limited to manuals, tutorials, or presentations) on how the sensors detect noises.

If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 80 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 281 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 774 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 879 days.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) FBI-Records Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4593\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391/4997\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Be advised, email addresses and personal telephone numbers have been redacted from the attached records pursuant to 7(1)(b) of FOIA, which provides that public bodies may redact information that is considered private. \u00a05 ILCS 2(c-5) of FOIA defines private information as follows: \"Private information\" means unique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers and email addresses. \u00a0Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. Additionally, L.E.A.D.S. hit responses, patient condition, unique identifiers, residential addresses, license plate numbers, driver's license numbers and personal telephone numbers have been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) which authorizes a public body to redact: Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would\u00a0constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \"Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" means the disclosure of information that is\u00a0highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. To the extent a portion of your FOIA request has been denied, you have a right of review by the Illinois Attorney General's Public Access Counselor who can be contacted at 500 S. Second St., Springfield, IL 62706 or by telephone at (877)-299-FOIA. Email: public.access@ilag.gov. You may also seek\u00a0judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. Sincerely, M.

        "communication": "On December 19, the department of education sent an email regarding this request (#F22,727,FOIL-2023-040-00555) to 154445-13358908@requests.muckrock.com. That's incorrect. The correct email address is 154447-94133837@requests.muckrock.com. It appears that a responsive document was similarly shared to the wrong address.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the production of a single responsive document. Though it is exceptionally confusing that it was delivered to the wrong address.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear to me why this continues, I have informed the department of education multiple times that MuckRock is designed to improve the FOIL experience for citizens and records access agencies in part by assigning unique email addresses to each filed request. Sending communications about requests to addresses other than the unique email address assigned to each request obfuscates and confuses the process greatly. Please fix this. I believe this to be an honest mistake, but if it continues I will start to question that assumption. I do not wish to argue or fight over this. It's just making things unnecessarily difficult for both of us.\r\n\r\nIn the December 19 communication, the agency first quoted the DOE regulations as such:\r\n\r\n----\r\nPursuant to Section VI.C of New York City Department of Education (DOE) Chancellor\u2019s Regulation D-110 (CR D-110), factors to be considered under CR D-110 in determining whether there exist circumstances necessitating more \r\ntime to respond to a request may include, but are not limited to:\r\n\u201c[1] the volume of a request, [2] the ease or difficulty in locating, retrieving or generating records, [3] the complexity of the request, [4] the need to review records to determine the extent to which they must be disclosed, [and 5] the number of requests received by the agency.\u201d1\r\n----\r\n...and then addresses the number of requests in progress:\r\n\"With respect to factor 5, at the time you made \r\nyour request, many other FOIL requests were already pending, many of which involved multiple factors, or all the factors cited above. A response to your request is expected by January 22, 2024.\"\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what I am addressing. \r\n\r\nThe text of the law and the case law I have reviewed shows the agency has obvious authority to extend the time to respond to a request. This also has been shown in court to apply when agencies have numerous requests to handle.\r\n\r\nHowever, it appears that the agency is acknowledging awareness of factors that might reasonably delay the fulfillment of the request by December 19, 2023.\r\n\r\nAt no point prior to the deadline was the estimated completion date updated.\r\n\r\nSeveral times, I have dealt with city agencies repeating the delay of fulfillment in increments of 1-3 months for up to two years at a time. At no point did any of them provide an accurate estimation of the completion date.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that records access officers are competent at their jobs and intelligent individuals, thus it strains my sense of credulity to accept that delays are so consistently unforseen and unforeseeable to the point where completion dates must routinely and normally be extended. It has further drained my sense of patience in dealing with agencies when the obvious happens. \r\n\r\nI have no qualm with the individual records access officer about this issue. I believe they are merely stuck working with a system that undervalues FOIL, and places overworked employees in a difficult position.\r\n\r\nThat does nothing to detract from the absurdity of an agency that first understaffs the FOIL positions, initially promises completion dates that are short enough to beguile requesters (but are rarely met), and then claims a lack of foresight about the failure to meet self imposed completion dates. Surely Kafka might've mistaken it for an excerpt from his work should he be alive today!\r\n\r\nThe law requires that agencies provide: \"a date certain within a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances, when the request will be granted in whole or in part\". Viewed through the isolated lens of each individual communication and interaction, it may very well appear reasonable to delay a given request by some arbitrary amount of time. Viewed in the larger picture, it is hard to conceive of the reasonableness of the situation. The majority of FOIL requests in the state are late enough to make a mockery of the intent of the freedom of information law. This is what I intend to fight when I refuse to accept extensions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven these facts, I am requesting solid and sincere confirmation that the January 22, 2024 completion date will be met.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot commit to that date with the information that is available between November 9, 2023 and now, I will appeal on the grounds of constructive denial.\r\n\r\nIf you commit to that date and miss it, I will appeal on the grounds of constructive denial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal email addresses and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Further, redactions were applied to mask communications between a parent and their child\u2019s school district pursuant to section 7(1)(c). Parents have a personal privacy interest under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) in their identifying information when they contact their child\u2019s school to express opinions. (See Ill. Att' y Gen. PAC Req. Rev.

Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

RCW 42.56.540 states: The examination of any specific public record may be enjoined if, upon motion and affidavit by upon motion and affidavit by an agency or its representative or a person who is named in the record or to whom the record specifically pertains, the superior court for the county in which the movant resides or in which the record is maintained, finds that such examination would clearly not be in the public interest and would substantially and irreparably damage any person, or would substantially and irreparably damage vital governmental functions.\u00a0 An agency has the option of notifying persons named in the record or to whom a record specifically pertains, that release of a record has been requested. Consequently, the City is providing this notification to Barry Paris and Union Representative Detective Betts to provide reasonable opportunity to review the records and determine whether they wish to seek a court order prohibiting or restricting disclosure. You can expect further response from the City on or before July 19, 2023. In the meantime, if you should have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu.

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Stathulis,\r\n\r\n\r\nWe received your request on 1-16-24 for the following information:\r\n\r\n  *   1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. Please see number two as the information being requested is not possible in this format from our RMS (Records Management System).\r\n\r\n  *   2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n     *   The total number of ALL 'juvenile arrests' (for the City of Salem) NOT just school related (including summons) for the requested timeframe 2018-2022= 244\r\n\r\n     *\r\nTo clarify which incidents were:\r\n 1. Arrests at a school (vs another location in the city)\r\n 2. Arrests (taken into custody) vs a court summons\r\nWe would need to read the narratives for ALL juvenile arrests/incident reports for the City of Salem (for that timeframe) as our Records Management System does not segregate information by 'school arrests' only.\r\n     *   Most juvenile incidents that take place in schools (of criminal nature) have resulted in a summons and not an actual arrest as it is a very rare occurrence that a juvenile would be taken into custody by law enforcement\r\n\r\n  *   3. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\nSee attached (reference - Salem School Resource Officer MOU)\r\n\r\n  *   4. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\nSee attached (reference - Salem PD Department Manual - Juvenile Operations Chapter 48)\r\nNo records found to fulfill this request as we are not the 'Keeper of the Records'\r\n\r\n  *   5. The cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and,\r\n\r\nThe total salaries allocated for this FY (fiscal year) for SROs in the Salem School District = $282,956.29 (as it is budgeted through the SPD)\r\n\r\n  *   6. The total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\nThe total number of SRO's for the years being requested = 2 per year for the district\r\n\r\nNo records found to fulfill this request as we are not the 'Keeper of the Records'\r\n\r\n  *   7.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Daniel Ellsberg. Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

I see that in the reply that contains these previously released documents, additional records that are responsive to my request exist. I am writing to confirm within the allotted thirty day window that this material does not satisfy my request as most of the documents are more than forty years old, and many are much older. I understand that Dr. Daniel Ellsberg continued to be of interest to the FBI long after the early 1980s. I request that the additional records about my requested subject be processed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in this matter.",

Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

The specific agenda item pertains to the renewal of the automated license plate reader (ALPR) cameras contract with a private company called Flock Safety, as used by the Village of Skokie Police Department.\r\n\r\nALPR technology carries with it significant implications for privacy and civil liberties. The ability of these surveillance systems to collect and store vast amounts of data on the movement of community members raises concerns about violation on our Fourth Amendment privacy rights[2].\r\n\r\nThe agenda item cites various statistics and outcomes attributed to the use of Flock Safety's ALPR technology. For transparency and public understanding, we seek evidence supporting these claims. Specifically, we request:\r\n\r\n1) Documentation or data supporting the statement that ALPR technology \u201chas become a critical and effective tool in both the prevention and investigation of crime has become a critical and effective tool in both the prevention and investigation of crime.\" This should include evidence showing the direct impact of ALPR technology on crime prevention and resolution in Skokie.\r\n\r\n2) Records or analysis that detail how the \"cameras collect and record objective information about passing vehicles such as license plate, vehicle color and body type and deposits this data in a secure searchable database.\" including any privacy safeguards in place for this data collection and storage.\r\n\r\n3) Evidence or reports that validate the claim \"Tapping into this rapidly growing network of data is a force multiplier and has had a dramatic effect on Skokie PD's ability to prevent and solve crimes.\" This should include specific examples or statistics demonstrating this impact.\r\n\r\n4) Detailed breakdowns or reports of the \"21,029,664 plate reads, approximately 11,801 searches, approximately 105 plates added to hotlists, and approximately 136,427 hotlist alerts\" mentioned in the agenda item. This should clarify the outcomes of these reads, searches, and alerts.\r\n\r\n5) Information on the \"129 investigations\" that were assisted by Flock ALPR technology in 2023, including how the technology contributed to these investigations, the nature of the crimes involved, and the results of these investigations, such as recoveries or arrests.\r\n\r\n6) Any audits, reviews, or assessments conducted by the Village of Skokie or external entities regarding the accuracy, effectiveness, and impact of the Flock Safety ALPR system in the community.\r\n\r\nCITATIONS:\r\n[1] Skokie Board of Trustees Regular Agenda Meeting Packet Dec 18, 2023 \r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20240109175006/https://www.skokie.org/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_12182023-1991>\r\n[2] U of M Ford School of Public Policy | Automated License Plate Readers: Legal and Policy Evaluation \r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20231208112551/https://stpp.fordschool.umich.edu/sites/stpp/files/2023-02/ALPR%20Memo%20Final%20Jan%202023_0.pdf>\r\nACLU Fast-Growing Company Flock is Building a New AI-Driven Mass-Surveillance System\r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20231208034301/https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/legal-documents/flock_1.pdf>\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records responsive to Dr. Leon Festinger (May 8, 1919 - February 11, 1989). Dr. Festinger was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1945-1947), the University of Michigan (1948-1951), the University of Minnesota (1951-1955), Stanford University (1955-1968), and The New School (1968-1989). While working for these institutions, he conducted research in the area of social psychology, famously developing the concept of cognitive dissonance in the books \"When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group That Predicted the Destruction of the World\", published in 1956, and \"A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance\", published the following year.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Dr. Festinger's privacy, as he passed away in 1989. I have attached a reproduction of Dr. Festinger's obituary, published in The New York Times on February 12, 1989.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
