Records that numerically separate the complaints of discrimination by present and previous employees of Adventist Health System/Sunbelt Inc. dba AdventHealth. To clarify, I request records that numerically breakdown complaints of discrimination against AdventHealth by AdventHealth location, to be interpreted as each individual location, and that it be separated by state, type of complaint of discrimination (such as on the basis of ADA, color, race, religion, sex, mental health and so to include all forms of discrimination within the scope of the EEOC).\r\n\r\n2. To preface - the distinct difference between this and (1) is filing a charge against AdventHealth - I request records that numerically separate the complaints of discrimination by present and previous employees of Adventist Health System/Sunbelt Inc. dba AdventHealth. To clarify, I request records that numerically breakdown charges of discrimination against AdventHealth and the breakdown be by AdventHealth location, to be interpreted as each individual location, and that it be separated by state, type of complaint of discrimination that led to a charge against AdventHealth (such as on the basis of ADA, color, race, religion, sex, mental health and so to include all forms of discrimination within the scope of the EEOC). If no such notion or meaningful distinction exists, then this may be disregarded.\r\n\r\n3. Records that specify that numerically indicate the charging part having won the case, so to speak, as well as by percentage, against AdventHealth (ie, Charging Party v. AdventHealth). I separately request numerically the same as the prior sentence, but excluding cases in which Charging Parties have withdrawn, not responded, or have settled with AdventHealth. To clarify, this need not include any separation by location, state, type of discrimination, and so on. \r\n\r\n4. Records that specify that numerically indicate the Respondent Party (being AdventHealth) having won the case, so to speak, as well as by percentage, against Charging Party. To clarify, this need not include any separation by location, state, type of discrimination, and so on.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Records that detail the consequences, ramifications, or disciplinary actions that can be taken against a healthcare facility in summation and if there exists any meaningful difference in terms of potential for disciplinary action according to precise setting (ie, hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory clinics, and so on), within the context of the scope and authority of the ACHA.\r\n\r\n1b. Contingent upon there existing a meaningful difference in potential for disciplinary actions according to the precise setting (ie, a hospital setting versus a nursing home setting versus an ambulatory clinic) then I request records that separate out the disciplinary action for each type of healthcare facility.\r\n\r\n2. Records that detail the precise scope of the ACHA itself as it relates to its investigative authority, power, and methods employed when investigating healthcare facilities. Additionally, I request the persons with which possess such investigative authority by listing position titles within ACHA.\r\n\r\n3. Records, manuals, and/or guidelines that detail how the ACHA handles complaints of healthcare facilities. Additionally, I request if ACHA makes use of or employs artificial intelligence (AI) or large language models (LLMs) in the handling of either complaints or investigations into healthcare facilities.\r\n\r\n4. Records that detail the precise scope and investigatory authority, power, methods employed (in the context of an investigation) as well as the precise extent of persons with investigative authority as deemed by ACHA. Additionally, if it is the case that multiple persons (meaning greater than one position title at ACHA has investigative authority) then I request records that separate both the position titles and the meaning distinction in terms of investigative authority, power, scope, and employed employed according to each position title (if such a notion and if such records exist within ACHA). \r\n\r\n5. Records that detail the complete listing of agencies with which the ACHA [regularly] cooperates with as it relates to investigations into healthcare facilities.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest.

Records that detail if or what manner the fourth amendment may apply in the context of a private employer compelling employees to submit to reasonable suspicion testing given the direct nexus of SAMHSA, when it is known that such private employer complies with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, if such records exist within the DOJ\u2019s jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n2. Records that detail the volume (ie, numerically) of civil rights complaints in the context of employment that fall outside of the scope of the EEOC.\r\n\r\n3. Records that detail how the DOJ Civil Rights Division separates out potential civil rights violations in the context of employment if such civil rights violations fall outside the scope of the EEOC. Additionally, I request, if known to the DOJ, what agency is most appropriate if a civil rights violation occurs in the context of employment but falls outside of the scope of the EEOC.\r\n\r\n4.

Records related to the handling of fictitious or materially false statements to federal government agencies made by private employers.\r\n\r\n3. Records related to if or in what manner a private employer, if such private employer can be proven to be acting on behalf of the federal government, can conspire against rights (in oppressing an employee\u2019s civil rights) and the distinction between a civil and criminal manner pertaining to conspiracy against rights, if any such record exists.\r\n\r\n4.Records/documents that relate to a private employer and consequences, ramifications, or disciplinary actions to such private employer when intentionally abusing or defrauding the United States (ie, a Federal Government Agency) and in what manner it can be said to be so, according to the DOJ.\r\n\r\n5. Records related to remedy available to employees when civil rights can be meaningfully construed to have been violated by a private employer, if such records exist.\r\n\r\n6. The most appropriate agency for which an employee may seek remedy for civil rights violations by a private employer, if not the DOJ Civil Rights Division or DOJ Criminal Division, and if known to the DOJ.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest.

Records that detail if or what manner the fourth amendment may apply in the context of a private employer compelling employees to submit to reasonable suspicion testing given the direct nexus of SAMHSA, when it is known that such private employer complies with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, if such records exist within the DOJ\u2019s jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n2. Records that detail the volume (ie, numerically) of civil rights complaints in the context of employment that fall outside of the scope of the EEOC.\r\n\r\n3. Records that detail how the DOJ Civil Rights Division separates out potential civil rights violations in the context of employment if such civil rights violations fall outside the scope of the EEOC. Additionally, I request, if known to the DOJ, what agency is most appropriate if a civil rights violation occurs in the context of employment but falls outside of the scope of the EEOC.\r\n\r\n4.

Records related to the handling of fictitious or materially false statements to federal government agencies made by private employers.\r\n\r\n3. Records related to if or in what manner a private employer, if such private employer can be proven to be acting on behalf of the federal government, can conspire against rights (in oppressing an employee\u2019s civil rights) and the distinction between a civil and criminal manner pertaining to conspiracy against rights, if any such record exists.\r\n\r\n4.Records/documents that relate to a private employer and consequences, ramifications, or disciplinary actions to such private employer when intentionally abusing or defrauding the United States (ie, a Federal Government Agency) and in what manner it can be said to be so, according to the DOJ.\r\n\r\n5.

Records that detail if or what manner the fourth amendment may apply in the context of a private employer compelling employees to submit to reasonable suspicion testing given the direct nexus of SAMHSA, when it is known that such private employer complies with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, if such records exist within the DOJ\u2019s jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n2. Records that detail the volume (ie, numerically) of civil rights complaints in the context of employment that fall outside of the scope of the EEOC.\r\n\r\n3. Records that detail how the DOJ Civil Rights Division separates out potential civil rights violations in the context of employment if such civil rights violations fall outside the scope of the EEOC. Additionally, I request, if known to the DOJ, what agency is most appropriate if a civil rights violation occurs in the context of employment but falls outside of the scope of the EEOC.\r\n\r\n4. Records that detail how a private employer could be considered a state actor, acting on behalf of the federal government, or acting under the direction of the federal government under the pretense of reasonable suspicion testing per the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and given the direct nexus to SAMHSA under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n2. Records related to the handling of fictitious or materially false statements to federal government agencies made by private employers.\r\n\r\n3. Records related to if or in what manner a private employer, if such private employer can be proven to be acting on behalf of the federal government, can conspire against rights (in oppressing an employee\u2019s civil rights) and the distinction between a civil and criminal manner pertaining to conspiracy against rights, if any such record exists.\r\n\r\n4.Records/documents that relate to a private employer and consequences, ramifications, or disciplinary actions to such private employer when intentionally abusing or defrauding the United States (ie, a Federal Government Agency) and in what manner it can be said to be so, according to the DOJ.\r\n\r\n5. Records related to remedy available to employees when civil rights can be meaningfully construed to have been violated by a private employer, if such records exist.\r\n\r\n6. The most appropriate agency for which an employee may seek remedy for civil rights violations by a private employer, if not the DOJ Civil Rights Division, and if known to the DOJ.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and communications responsive to Mr. Robert Lowell Moore, Jr., aka Robin Moore (October 31, 1925 \u2013 February 21, 2008). He was an author of such books as The Green Berets, The French Connection, and Court Martial. All or some of this file has been released to a prior requestor(s); a portion was published by a now defunct blog, Entropic Memes, in 2008. Mr. Moore's case file number is identified by that requestor as 94-61092. Please see attached documents and the following link archived by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine: https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165610/http://www.slugsite.com/archives/897\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am requesting any parts of Mr. Moore's file that have been released previously and those not yet released.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search for Mr. Moore. This would include any files the bureau may have on the Junta Revolucionaria Cubana, or JURE (Bureau file number 105-114543; Miami file number 105-6661).\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Moore's privacy, as he passed away on February 21, 2008. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. Please see attached documents and the following link, for an obituary published by the New York Times on February 23, 2008: https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/23/books/23moore.html\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Per the bureau's prior release of Mr. Moore's file, at least one bureau memo, dated May 5, 1965, states of The Green Berets, \"classified information is contained in Moore's book.\"\r\n\r\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) monitored Mr. Moore in this period as well. Please see a clip of press coverage about The Green Berets, attached, which was archived by the CIA shortly after the May 5, 1965 bureau memo. This document can found in the CIA's CREST system and in the Reading Room on its website: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP75-00149R000700610012-8.pdf\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how the bureau and other agencies handled investigations into journalists and writers who covered or disclosed the actions of American intelligence agencies is in the public's interest.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said destruction or transfer, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the bureau has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
