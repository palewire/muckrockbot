Please ignore and just close out the window, you do not need to make an account or pay a fee through box to review the records.)\r\n\r\nYou will have until Monday, January 29th , 2024 to access the responsive records to your request.  After that time, the link will automatically be disabled.\r\n\r\nYour request is now fulfilled and is closed, please do not hesitate to reach-out to me if you have any issues accessing your responsive records or have any questions for the Records Office.\r\n\r\nI hope you have a great weekend and a happy new year!\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D9D75C.0B691760]\r\n\r\nNicole Peterson (She/Her)\r\nProgram Specialist 3\r\n1111 Israel Rd.

If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records.

Secretary Mayorkas appeared in the video as well. In this videotaped interview, the Secretary stated that DHS is looking into facilities across the nation, and that \"Stewart is one\" of these facilities. Secretary Mayorkas committed to taking action if DHS's investigation into Stewart revealed inhumane treatment. \r\n\r\nIn July 2022, four women formerly detained at Stewart filed a complaint alleging sexual abuse and harassment by a male medical provider at Stewart, and retaliation and unlawful PREA violations in the subsequent investigation ICE allowed CoreCivic to conduct into these allegations. \r\n\r\nDescription of Records Sought:\r\nPlease provide (1) any Taskers regarding the Stewart Detention Center between January 20, 2021 and the present, from the Secretary of Homeland Security's Office to ICE or DHS HQ or any other DHS agency component, and (2) the responses received by the Office of the Secretary to each Tasker. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Secretary Mayorkas appeared in the video as well. In this videotaped interview, the Secretary stated that DHS is looking into facilities across the nation, and that \"Stewart is one\" of these facilities. Secretary Mayorkas committed to taking action if DHS's investigation into Stewart revealed inhumane treatment. In July 2022, four women formerly detained at Stewart filed a complaint alleging sexual abuse and harassment by a male medical provider at Stewart, and retaliation and unlawful PREA violations in the subsequent investigation ICE allowed CoreCivic to conduct into these allegations. Description of Records Sought: Please provide (1) any Taskers regarding the Stewart Detention Center between January 20, 2021 and the present, from the Secretary of Homeland Security's Office to ICE or DHS HQ or any other DHS agency component, and (2) the responses received by the Office of the Secretary to each Tasker. Thank you, Andrew Free #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative Al Otro Lado.  Your request was received in this office on 11/13/2022.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.

We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Daniel Ellsberg. Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

I see that in the reply that contains these previously released documents, additional records that are responsive to my request exist. I am writing to confirm within the allotted thirty day window that this material does not satisfy my request as most of the documents are more than forty years old, and many are much older. I understand that Dr. Daniel Ellsberg continued to be of interest to the FBI long after the early 1980s. I request that the additional records about my requested subject be processed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in this matter.",

Note that I requested info on all films that NASA participated in the production of, in any capacity whatsoever, between 2016 and 2020. Am I to assume that, during  this period, NASA only signed such agreements with three productions? If there are additional Space Act Agreements with other productions during this period, I would appreciate those as well.\r\n\r\nAttached is a list from NASA of entertainment industry productions supported for the years 2006-2015. A similar list for the years 2017-2020 would be appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo ",

In our records search Bert Ulrich identified the films corresponding to each Space Act Agreement (SAA) as being the only movies NASA collaborated with, and provided the agreements as part of the list. I apologize for not explaining this more clearly and also not explaining that those SAAs for each movie is a complete list of movies for the time period specified in the request.\r\n\r\nI also mentioned NASA\u2019s Records Retention Schedule, which is available at following web address: https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/NPR_attachments/NRRS_1441.1.pdf. If permanent records exist they may have been sent to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in accordance with the Federal Records Act and NASA Records Record Retention Schedule. NARA\u2019s contact is available at the following website: https://www.archives.gov/foia/contacts.html.\r\n\r\nWe also talked about NASA points of contact who have their email and phone numbers listed online for media outlets and media researchers. You can find those contacts at the following website (some have email addresses and phone numbers listed) : https://www.nasa.gov/news/media-contacts/.\r\n\r\nHopefully this information is helpful.
