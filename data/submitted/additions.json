        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Arizona Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny and all documents/records referring to Bruce Hume (aka Bruce R. Hume, Bruce Huminski) or containing the name of Bruce Hume during the time period of 2010 - 2015. During this time period Bruce R. Hume was a resident of Wilton, Ct and employed by the Norwalk Police Department, Connecticut.\r\n\r\nDetective Debra Hartin of the Gilbert P.D. had multiple interfaces and communications with the Wilton Ct. PD and the Surprise, AZ PD concerning Bruce Hume's harassment allegations concerning Scott Huminski in 2011-2013.  \r\n\r\nAt the time, Scott Huminski was a resident of Gilbert and Detective Hartin was communicating with police agencies about this matter. As such, the \"Bruce Hume\" documents and materials may also be located in a record search related to Justin M. Nelson (deceased) or Scott Huminski.\r\n\r\nHere are the Wilton Connecticut reports on the Bruce Hume issue mentioned Detective Hartin of the Gilbert PD, Surprise Police and her status of being on the case. These documents are available to the public via Muckrock.\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2017/01/19/1100010541.pdf\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2017/01/19/1200009492.pdf\r\n\r\nBruce R. Hume, DOB 12/3/1956, resident Wilton CT, employed at Norwalk CT Police Dept. during the specified time period.\r\n\r\nA record search for Wilton CT, Norwalk CT, Detective Debra Hartin or the Gilbert, AZ Police Department may yield the proper records with the additional search term of Bruce Hume.   \r\n\r\nIn 2013 Detective Debra Hartin informed Scott Huminski that Bruce Hume was on a campaign to terrorize, harass and financially harm Scott Huminski regarding an estate matter related to Theodore Huminski, thus Hume's communications were considered vexatious and in the pursuit of a vendetta against his brother, Scott Huminski, and the allegations were considered as completely without merit by all police agencies involved in Arizona, Connecticut and the FBI.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nscott huminski",
