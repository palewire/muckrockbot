You seek the following: \r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA list of all non-documentary television programs which NASA supported, or with which NASA collaborated in any way, during the year 2024. NASA has previously released to me lists of feature films and documentaries the agency supported in 2024, but they did not send me a list of television programs specifically. Lists for other years released to me by NASA include TV collaborations as a separate category.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation as well as the editor-in-chief and a contributor to a research magazine published by said foundation titled \"Cultural Engineering Studies.\" These documents will be used for public education and research purposes, and I have previously used documents released by NASA via FOIA in published research articles. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/Brett-DCF/160858/FOIA_waiver_letter_9_25_24.pdf\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/Brett-DCF/160858/501c3_application_and_approval.pdf\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fnasa-224%252Frequest-to-nasa-for-all-2024-tv-collaborations-191913%252F%253Femail%253Dadmin%252540ains.com&url_auth_token=AAAXYVVxAlHxTJg0bC-PRu4-trw%3A1uqmDR%3AjHu3LcfySxWLn-ybth4uPtcMB2FnO30jn_7zN9brV3k \r\n\r\nPlease reference case number 25-01230-F-OIG in all future correspondence regarding this reequest.\r\nRegards, \r\nNASA Public Access Link",

Critically, that order must itself appear in the record, to maintain transparency about what was excluded and why.\r\n\r\nIn his appearance before the Court, Lloyd Painter testified he witnessed the deliberate machine-gunning of life rafts we had dropped over the side in anticipation of abandoning ship. This FOIA request includes his sworn statement as an attachment.\r\n\r\nAccording to CINCUSNAVEUR 181105Z JUN67 USS Liberty crewmen testified before the Court they thought the attack was deliberate. CINCUSNAVEUR 181105Z JUN67 is included as an attachment to this FOIA request.\r\n\r\nNowhere in the US Navy Court of Inquiry Report released to the public does Lloyd Painter\u2019s testimony or the crew testimony referenced above appear. \r\n\r\nNor does the authorization from the convening authority authorizing the removal of the testimony appear.\r\n\r\nWe request you release to us a copy of the order from the Convening Authority authorizing the removal of testimony given before the US Navy Court of Inquiry into the attack on the USS Liberty, including but not limited to Lloyd Painter\u2019s testimony of his witnessing the deliberate machine gunning of life rafts we had dropped over the side in anticipation of abandoning ship and authorizing the removal of USS Liberty survivor testimony that they thought the attack was deliberate.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
