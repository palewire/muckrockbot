The charges were dropped on September 5th by the District Attorney\u2019s Office, so it is assumed that the case was settled in court. Please redact any exempt information where necessary, rather than withholding the entirety of the information if possible.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoseph Pasteris",

Records are releasable in the public interest, due to Martinez's notoriety as a high-level dealer as part of a known Drug Trafficking Organization. \r\n\r\nTo identify records, the following information is known about Di Lauro:\r\n\r\nFull name: Cosimo Di Lauro\r\nNickname: o' Chiatto\r\nDate of Birth: December 8, 1973\r\nDate of Death: June 13, 2022\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

We are treating your request as a request for public records in accordance with California Government Code Section 7920.000 and following (the California Public Records Act, or \u201cthe Act\u201d). The Act requires that public agencies make reasonably identified, non-exempt public records available for inspection or provide copies upon payment of the direct costs of duplication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City is required to notify you within ten (10) days whether the requested records will be disclosed. (Gov. Code section 7922.535(a)). On August 14th, the City notified you that we would need an additional 14 days to respond pursuant to Government Code section 7922.535(b). This response fulfills the City\u2019s obligations under the Act. Responsive, non-exempt public records have been recovered and will be provided as soon as possible, after review by the City Attorney\u2019s Office. Once the review has been completed the City will release those documents in a rolling release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the City makes those responsive records available to you, it will redact all information determined to be privileged or exempt from disclosure under the CPRA or other applicable law. These redactions will include, but not be limited to: (i) Government Code section 7927.700, 7927.705 (incorporating privacy exemptions found in the United States Constitution and Article 1, section 1 of the California Constitution), which exempts certain private information from disclosure where the release of such records would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; (ii) Government code section 7927.500, which allows for \u201cpreliminary drafts, notes, or interagency or intra-agency memoranda that are not retained\u2026in the ordinary course of business\u201d to be withheld when the public interest in withholding the records clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure; (iii) Government Code Section 7922.000 \u201cdeliberative process privilege,\u201d implied by California courts from the \u201cpublic interest exception.\u201d Under this exemption, records containing information which could expose the public agency\u2019s decision making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and undermine its ability to perform its functions are exempt from disclosure; (iv) provisions of the Evidence Code related to privilege.\u201d (Gov. Code \u00a7 7927.705.) This provision incorporates records subject to Evidence Code section 954, which exempts lawyer-client communications from disclosure.

Lee\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nPlymouth County Sheriff\r\n24 Long Pond Road\r\nPlymouth, MA 02360\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Lee, \r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Massachusetts Public Record Law (M.G.L. Chapter 66, Section 10). I am requesting that I be provided a copy of the following records: \r\n\r\n1. Any policies or procedures that dictate what educational and programmatic services are offered to Federal Detainees and ICE Detainees within Plymouth Sheriff\u2019s custody.\r\n\r\n2. Records that indicate what educational services (including but not limited to K-12 education, Special Education, Vocational Education, High School Equivalency, or post-secondary education), if any, were provided to federal detainees and ICE detainees  from January 2021 through the date that this request is responded to. We request records that show the age of the detainee who received educational services, and the type of educational services provided. If no educational services were provided during this time, a statement to that effect would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Public Records law requires you to provide me with a written response within 10 business days.  I would appreciate an electronic response via email.  Thank you, in advance.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n44 School St. Suite 415,\r\nBoston, MA 02108\r\n617-338-1050",

As such, this would not fall under an exemption, as it is not a pre-decision opinion by CMS. Could this redaction be removed? This email is being forwarded by the CMS employee as an \"FYI\".\r\n\r\n2) On page 234 of the PDF, an employee of CMS has received a copy from an outside organization of an article published in The Journal of Clinical Oncology (a journal and article available to the public). The (b)(5) redaction appears to be applied to the employees opinion on the article, not on internal decision making process. As the opinion is being rendered on a public document, and after contact initiated by an outside organization, could this redaction be removed?\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the rest of the release, the other Exemption 5 redactions seem consistent, save for these two.\r\n\r\nAgain, I really appreciate this work. This was a huge number of files!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nControl Number 090820227055 and PIN T3QD",

However, in reviewing your request I do not see a date range in which you are seeking responsive records.  Please let me know what date range you are asking us to search within.  This will allow me to complete the search in a timely fashion.  Additionally, the inclusion of common names (i.e. Karen etc.) is likely to capture numerous communications that may or may not be relevant to your intended request.  To the extent you are able to provide more specific search terms it will aid in processing the request and reduce the volume of unrelated items that are pulled.  Finally, the inclusion of \"Morrisey\" as a search term will result in any emails or communications with the Attorney General's name in signature blocks.  Again, to the extent you are able to provide clarity on the information sought or let me know which search terms should be search in conjunction with each other, rather than each individually, it will aid in processing your request so that we are able to provide the information you are seeking.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to email me at this address or call me at 304-558-1482 to discuss this matter at your convenience.\r\n\r\nOnce I have received the date range, and any other clarification, I will be able to provide you with a date our response will be provided.\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSteven\r\n\r\nSteven A.

Please search all of his CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business.

RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal email addresses, parents\u2019 names, employee identification numbers, medical information, and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)).

Any policy, guidance, handbook, manual, or standard contract concerning the institution\u2019s interactions or relationship with members of the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\n2. Any policy, guidance, handbook, or manual concerning the interactions or communications of institutional employees, including faculty, administrators, staff, and student employees, with the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

As per our previous correspondence, I am considering your request fulfilled by the provided closing reports, which were redacted pursuant to FOIL. \r\nThe CCRB closing report does not represent the final agency determination of the Board; it is merely a recommendation by the investigator to the Board. Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g)(iii) permits the CCRB to deny access to records that are \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency materials which are not . . . final agency policy or determinations.\u201d\u00a0 Accordingly, we do not disclose CCRB work product, opinions, recommendations, advice, or records which reflect the consultative and deliberative process. Such records were redacted because they do not constitute final agency determinations. \r\nAdditionally, these reports contain information, such as names, addresses, ages, and dates of birth, and other personal identifying information as defined in Public Officers Law \u00a7 89. As a City agency, we are also subject to N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 23-1201 and are required to withhold personal identifying information to the extent permitted under FOIL. Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(b) permits the CCRB to deny access to records or information that \u201cif disclosed would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Such personal identifying information has been redacted. \r\nNYS Office of Court Administration records are exempt from FOIL under Public Officers Law \u00a7\u00a7 86(1), 86(3), and 86(4), which define \"judiciary,\" \"agency,\" and \"record\" and state that records from agencies that are identified as judiciary are exempt from FOIL. Additionally, the CCRB has a contract with the Office of Court Administration that conditions our ability to access their records, a necessity for our investigations, on not releasing those records except as proscribed by the contract. So as to not interfere with the contract the CCRB has with the New York State Officer of Court Administration as permitted under Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(c) and to comply with the defined terms of FOIL, any information obtained from the search of the Office of Court Administration\u2019s database have been redacted. \r\nOther redactions, such as those based on Public Officers Law \u00a7\u00a7 87(2)(a) (\"specifically exempted from disclosure by state or federal statute\u201d), 87(2)(e) (law enforcement and investigative records), 87(2)(f) (life and safety), and 87(4-b) (technical infractions) are noted as applicable within the reports. \r\n \r\nYou may appeal the decision to deny access to material that was redacted in part or withheld in entirety by contacting the agency's FOIL Appeals Officer: foil@ccrb.nyc.gov within 30 days.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

Therefore, I anticipate that there should be no additional cost associated with this revised request.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to receiving the revised information at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLanny Hartmann",

If you are able to prioritize those, we would be most appreciative.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help.\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nKatharine S. Walter",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Daniel Ellsberg. Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

I see that in the reply that contains these previously released documents, additional records that are responsive to my request exist. I am writing to confirm within the allotted thirty day window that this material does not satisfy my request as most of the documents are more than forty years old, and many are much older. I understand that Dr. Daniel Ellsberg continued to be of interest to the FBI long after the early 1980s. I request that the additional records about my requested subject be processed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in this matter.",
