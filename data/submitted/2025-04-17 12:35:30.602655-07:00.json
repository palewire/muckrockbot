        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nBy way of background: \r\n\r\nAt some point near the end of 2024, NARA published a report titled \"2024 Update for Reparative Description\" at <https://www.archives.gov/research/reparative-description/update-2024>.  (This page has since been removed.) The update states NARA \"moved reparative description work from a temporary working group to incorporating reparative description into the regular description processes of the agency\". The page makes reference to various processes and training materials, for which it is reasonable to assume there will be records. Specifically, NARA wrote:\r\n\r\n1. \"We are incorporating reparative description training into the regular agency-wide training program for the staff who work on description.\"\r\n2. \"We developed and implemented processes for terms to be identified and recommendations for updating to be submitted by staff or the public for consideration.\"\r\n3. \"We developed the process for our standards board to review submissions and provide final recommendations for the Archivist.\"\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. A copy of any \"reparative description training\" materials referenced at the above web page. If they are embedded within a larger web page, document, PDF, slide deck, or video, the entire training document is requested. This request for the version of the materials which is being referenced at the time of the publication of the undated Update above. If it cannot be determined anymore what the publication date is, December 31, 2024.\r\n\r\n2. A copy of the agency policy, guidelines, memo, or other documents which were referred to when NARA described that it had developed \"processes for terms to be identified and recommendations for updating\".\r\n\r\n3.  A copy of the agency policy, guidelines, memo, or other documents which were referred to when NARA described that it had developed \"the process for our standards board to review submissions and provide final recommendations\"\r\n\r\n4. Copies of any such recommendations made to the Archivist by the NARA Lifecycle Data Standards Board under the above cited process, both approved and rejected (if any). Or if they were tracked in a spreadsheet or similar single document with information about the recommendations and the Archivist's responses, this is preferable to conducting a search of emails.\r\n\r\n5. As pertains to the process(es) outlined in request #2 & #3 above, I also request a copy of the CURRENT authorized version of the operative agency policy, if it has changed since it was described in the statement in the 2024 Update. Or, if it was rescinded, any memo or record indicating such.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of any charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the 'Uniform Probate Court Rules' (including Rule 1. Preliminary Provisions; Rule 4. Court Records), I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1) Who is the ADA Coordinator for the Probate Court of Lamar County?\r\n2) What is the PROCESS FOR REQUESTING disability accommodations through the Probate Court of Lamar County? \r\n3) Provide a WRITTEN POLICY of the Probate Court of Lamar County's ADA/Section 504 policy on the accommodation process (as required by the 'Uniform Probate Court Rules' Rule 4. Court Records). \r\n4) What is the POLICY FOR FILING FORMAL COMPLAINTS when the Probate Court of Lamar County ignores a disabled person's request for accommodations? \r\n\r\nBased on information received from SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS, the Probate Court of Lamar County has failed to adequately respond to requests for disability accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The ADA protects ALL participants, including parties, witnesses, jurors, observers, attendees at events, and attorneys (collectively referred to as \"Parties\" going forward) (See  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101; See Prakel v. Indiana, App. F, p. 9.; See Mosier v. Kentucky, App. F, p. 10). \r\n\r\nIndividuals \"with disabilities SHALL NOT, by reason of their disability, be discriminated against, or be excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of services and programs conducted by the courts\" (See 'A Meaningful Opportunity to Participate: A Handbook for Georgia Court Officials on Courtroom Accessibility for Individuals with Disabilities'). Since early 2023, it appears multiple requests for disability accommodations have been submitted to the Probate Court of Lamar County without any further directions, guidance, or equal access. Consequently, SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS have reported being unable to gain equal access to the Probate Court of Lamar County. Several Parties requiring equal access, effective communication, and accommodations have been ignored often causing harm to those individuals. \r\n\r\nTHIS REQUIREMENT APPLIES TO ALL COMMUNICATION-RELATED COURT ACTIVITIES AND INFORMATION INCLUDING: HEARINGS, JURY DELIBERATIONS, WEBSITES, ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SUCH AS FORMS AND DOCUMENTS, ANNOUNCEMENTS, COURT DECISIONS AND ORDERS, SIGNAGE, AND OTHERS (A Meaningful Opportunity to Participate, p. 19). For example, communicating with Parties via email who cannot use a telephone, clerk or other staff members handwriting information in forms for individuals who have physical impairments, and more. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n*The Probate Court of Lamar County fails to scan documents into the online system available to all probate courts in Georgia (https://georgiaprobaterecords.com). Therefore, Parties do not have access to Lamar County Probate records. \r\n     >When the Probate Court of Lamar County provides paper records to Parties, they cannot be scanned or recognized by screen reader technology, as required by Title III of the ADA, and several other laws. \r\n\r\n*The ADA Title II regulations mandate that all US state and local government websites and mobile applications meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at Level A and AA.\r\n     >The Probate Court of Lamar County does NOT comply with the WCAG guidelines, as required by Title II of the ADA /Section 504 (https://www.lamarcountyga.com/departments/probate-court).\r\n     >This prevents Parties from being able to contact the Probate Court of Lamar County. \r\n\r\nThis is another GOOD FAITH attempt to exhaust as many potential administrative remedies to gain equal access, effective communication, and accommodations for multiple Parties that have been excluded from the Probate Court of Lamar County over the last two years on the basis of disability. \r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court decided in Tennessee v. Lane in 2004 (above, footnote 1) that states are subject to lawsuits filed in federal court under Title II for money damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief; Congress had appropriately abrogated sovereign immunity when it enacted the ADA, specifically as to \u201cjudicial services.\u201d See case description, App. F, p. 1. \r\n\r\nTO CONCLUDE AND REITERATE: \r\n\r\n1) Who is the ADA Coordinator for the Probate Court of Lamar County?\r\n2) What is the process for requesting disability accommodations through the Probate Court of Lamar County? \r\n3) Provide a written policy of the Probate Court of Lamar County's ADA/Section 504 policy on the accommodation process (as required by the 'Uniform Probate Court Rules' Rule 4. Court Records). \r\n\r\nNOTE: There should be no fees associated with fulfilling this request, as Public Entities are not allowed to place surcharges on attempts to request legal disability accommodations. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling this request to document another example of surcharges being placed on disabled Parties attempting to have equal access to the Probate Court of Lamar County. This request should preferably be fulfilled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. A response from someone within three days is expected. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nDisabled Individuals attempting to gain basic access to Lamar County Courts.",
