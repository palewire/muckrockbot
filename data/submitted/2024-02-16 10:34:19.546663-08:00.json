If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible.

By Air-force Intelligence, OSS, Army investigators, CIOS and several others. These locations were handed over to US forces on orders of General Hans Kammler on May 7, I also requesting release of ALL this documentation, the photographs, films and inventory lists created.

And I request information of the SS Generals final resting place. \r\nGiven the nature of the German research and the SS Generals expertise this information may have been decentralized to various agencies, As it appears he lived in the US under a new name multiple agencies would have files on Hans Kammler none of these have yet been declassified and it is time to do this now. \r\n\r\nThe Facilities I request ALL information to be released and de-classified on, are the following:\r\n\r\nAustria, St. Georgen Gusen (Near Linz) \r\nCode name: Bergkristall,B8 or Esche or Georgenm\u00fchle M\u00f6glegrube and the parallel underground production factory Kellerbau both run by the SS. Bergkristall was a huge underground factory and research system, producing mainly ME262 Jets and V2 Parts and other. Run by the SS with labor from local KZ camp Mauthausen. It was handed over to US Army troops in early May 1945, intact, SS General Kammler was there on May 4th. several weeks later it was handed over to the Russian army. it was surveyed, documented and filmed extensively by several US agencies, inventoried in detail. \r\nGerman organization Todt OT had it named as Object 503 and it has document file number 624 with Operational Group VI.\r\n\r\nAustria, Melk near Roggendorf and Loosdorf. \r\nCodename: Quarz I and II B8 or Melk, Organisation Todt reference number OT Nr. 505 and 519 code named Esche II it was a large underground tunnel system for production of various machinery for German and Austrian military production. \r\n\r\nGermany, Nordhausen, Niedersachswerfen, Wolffleben, Harztor. \r\nCode name: Dora Mittlebau I, Ellrich Mittlebau II, Harzungen Mittlebau III, other codenames for this underground tunnel complex: Mittlebau, Mittelwerk, Anhydrit, Kaolin, Eber, Kuckuck I, Zinnstein, Nordwerk, Hydra I, Hydra II. \r\nHuge underground tunnel system, consisting of several systems and entrances. for production of V2 rockets, V1 rockets, Jet air planes and parts. and other manufacturing. The System was captured by the US Army on 11 April 1945. It was extensively documented, photographed and video filmed, inventoried by all US and British intelligence and military intelligence, OSS, CIOS and ALSOS teams. Also congressional teams visited the site, and handed it over to Russian forces month later. after removing inventory and machinery, and documents. OT call names are: 5183, 518, 500. The location was handed over intact on orders of SS General Hans Kammler. none of this documentation have been released or declassified and I request this be done now. \r\n\r\nSeveral US CIOS reports on these subjects were released in part or not at all, these I also request in FULL unredacted, With ALL attached documents and photos.. the CIOS Report numbers requested are. XXXIII-38 and report number XXXII-17\r\n\r\nGermany, Jonastal, Ohrdruf, Arnstadt, Crawinkel, Codename SIII or Jonastal SIII.

Still much of the information, documentation, reports and photographic documentation on the General and the Tunnel factories have never been fully declassified, or released to the public. this information is 79 years old, it should have been released long ago, and the strategic or military value of what was found can no longer hold any importance.

The System was captured by the US Army on 11 April 1945.

Still much of the information, documentation, reports and photographic documentation on the General and the Tunnel factories have never been fully declassified, or released to the public. this information is 79 years old, it should have been released long ago, and the strategic or military value of what was found can no longer hold any importance. I am requesting this to be released on behalf of history and the families involved, including the Kammler Family. \r\n\r\nIf you need further documentation or report references please contact me for these. \r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nTino Struckmann\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTino Von Struckmann",

What is the timeframe for the information you are requesting? A specific timeframe (e.g., last calendar year, 2018-2020, etc.) would enable us to provide responsive information that we may have more efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. For category 2 of your request, I would like to clarify that the District Attorney's Office does not \"request\" an arraignment of the court but simply arraigns a case where appropriate.  Similarly, for category 3, the DA's office do not \"request\" diversion in a case (more on this below).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. For the categories of your request concerning diversion, I would like to clarify that there are two broad types of diversion you may be inquiring about: (1) cases where a complaint has issued against a juvenile and, upon request of the child, the juvenile court decides on the eligibility of a child for diversion that is overseen by the court; and (2) cases where the DA's office makes its own decision to divert a case prior to arraignment under our own Juvenile and Young Adult Diversion Program. Links to the statute that governs these two types of diversion is below, as is a link to our website with information about our diversion programs. Could you please clarify which type of diversion your request concerns?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXVII/Chapter119/Section54A\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.middlesexda.com/beyond-courtroom/pages/juvenile-and-young-adult-diversion-programs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Lastly, it is unclear what you mean by the distinction \"formal/informal\" diversion in categories 6 & 7 of your request. Our Office and the juvenile courts do not use this terminology. Could you please clarify the kind of information you are seeking for those categories?\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThank You,\r\n\r\nDaniel\r\n\r\nDaniel M. DeBlander\r\nAssistant District Attorney, Appeals & Training Bureau\r\nMiddlesex District Attorney's Office\r\n15 Commonwealth Avenue\r\nWoburn, MA 01801",
