Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at dillon@muckrock.com, or by phone at (267) 314-7952.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDillon Bergin",

Please note that some individuals may find the information in these reports disturbing.\r\n\r\nBe advised that certain information must be redacted from our reports. This includes:\r\n    * Medical record information obtained by a coroner or medical examiner pursuant to Civil Code \u00a756.10 (b)(8) and (c)(6), incorporated by Government Code \u00a76254 (k);\r\n    * Other medical information or similar information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy under Government Code \u00a76254 (c) and the California Constitution, article 1, section 1*;\r\n    * Personal and/or private information of individuals under Government Code \u00a76254 (k), incorporating the California Constitution, article 1, section 1*;\r\n    * Protected organ donor information pursuant to Health and Safety Code \u00a77150, et seq;\r\n    * Privileged information prohibited from disclosure pursuant to federal and/or state evidence laws, such as Evidence Code \u00a71040.\r\n\r\n*Right to Privacy: Courts have recognized the surviving family member's right to personal privacy. Therefore, even if a decedent no longer has a privacy interest, the family member(s) have a privacy interest over the disclosure of information contained within an autopsy report. For instance, a decedent may not have a right to privacy over their medical history, but the surviving family member does. Accordingly, families hold a substantive due process right under the 14th Amendment and that information should be redacted to protect their privacy interests.

Records Requested: To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAtNight Media (formerly Original Media Group) requests video, audio, and photographic files from police responses to the home of Brian Laundrie.\r\n\r\n(1) Background.\r\n\r\nThis Request for Information relates to Gabrielle \u201cGabby\u201d Petito, a 22-year-old resident of North Port, Florida, who was traveling with her boyfriend in and around Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in late August 2021.

On Tuesday, Sept. 21, the Teton County Coroner's Office announced her manner of death was determined to be homicide. \r\n\r\nOn September 22, 2021, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming issued a federal arrest warrant in connection to the murder for Brian Laundrie.\r\n\r\n(2) Request.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks material relating to police activity at the Brian Laundrie\u2019s residence (the \u201cLaundries Residence\u201d). The address is 4343 Wabasso Avenue in North Port, Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2.1) Body-cam footage from the interactions with Brian, Christopher and/or Roberta Laundrie (collectively the \u201cLaundries Family\u201d) from May 25, 2021 to Present Day at the Laundrie Residence.\r\n\r\n(2.2) Reports, written notes, or photos taken at both calls for service from September 1, 2021 to Present Day from the Laundry Residence. \r\n\r\n(2.3) Audio recordings of any 911 calls from the Laundry Residence from September 1, 2021 to Present Day.\r\n(2.4) Video or audio (i.e. recorded phone calls, body-cam, etc.) of any members of the Laundrie Family taken by members of the North Port Police Department from September 1, 2021 to Present Day.\r\n\r\nIf more audio, video or photographs than what was initially released exists, we kindly ask for those to be included.\r\n\r\nIf this request is unclear, please contact me to allow revisions rather than deny the request. Similarly, if the requested data are available only in part, please fulfill the portion of the request that is available rather than denying it in full. For example, notes or reports are available/subject to release but personal identifying information are not, reply with the report summary and omit sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\nJune 17, 2024 Miriam Bhimani RE: Chicago Public Schools FOIA Request N015357-060124 \r\nDear Ms. Bhimani: \r\nThis letter is in reply to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking the following information: Pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\nProvide records sufficient to show from May 01, 2024 to May 31, 2024: \r\n1. The number of Application for Transportation Service requests, aka \"White Forms\", submitted; \r\n2. The number of students who have accepted transportation reimbursement stipends; \r\n3. Special Education Students Missing Active Transportation Request - anonymized aggregated students including type of transportation. RESPONSE: Documents responsive to parts one (1) and two (2) of your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests. Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPart three (3) of this request fails to cite an existing record for review. Note that the district does not maintain data reflecting counts of \u201cSpecial Education Students Missing Active Transporting Request\u201d in the same record or database as data reflecting \u201ctype of transportation\u201d. In order to respond to that portion of the request, the district would be required to pull data from multiple sources maintained by different departments, conduct original research and analysis to join to the two datasets, and then manually combine them in order to create a new record, not maintained in the normal course of business and outside the scope of the FOIA. \r\nThe requirements of the FOIA apply to public records \u201chaving been prepared by or for, or having been or being used by, received by, or in the possession of, or under the control of any public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/2(c)]. Accordingly, and as determined in Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989), the FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. \r\nAdditionally, a FOIA request must reasonably identify a record(s) for review and not \u201ca general request for data, information and statistics to be gleaned generally from documents which have not been created and which the agency does not generally create or require.\u201d [ Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989)]. Additionally, \u201cA requester is entitled only to records that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.\u201d [ Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1922)] Additionally, Section 1\u00a0of the\u00a0FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part\u00a0of\u00a0any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\"\u00a0In accordance with Section 1\u00a0of\u00a0Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. Personally identifiable student record information is exempt from release in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Ana Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

But as you might guess, the request references a large number of records.

The simulation would involve \u201cfake firearms in a mock shooting,\u201d the department said it wrote to school staff on May 23. \r\n\r\nI am looking for:\r\n\r\n- planning documents, memos, emails or other communications about the planning of the described demonstration\r\n- emails between the department and the school staff about the scheduled demonstration. Please include the May 23rd email to school staff \r\n- after action reports or communications within the department after the incident.\r\n- surveillance footage of the incident or recordings of the incident\r\n\r\nAs required under the law, I request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically. If you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory exemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to only a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and provide the remainder of the record, as required under the statute.\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

        "communication": "Dear FBI:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act. Please produce all records related to Esther Cooper Jackson, a self-proclaimed Black communist revolutionary. Ms. Jackson was born in Arlington, Virginia on Aug. 21, 1917 and died on August 23, 2022 in Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nOTHER NAMES USED: The subject's maiden name was Esther Victoria Cooper. \r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH: \r\n\r\nIn addition to standard practices, please search the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices.\r\n\r\nPlease include a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and things to see if they contain additional records related to Ms. Jackson: (1) James E. Jackson Jr., the subject's husband, (2) Freedomways magazine, which the subject edited, and (3) the Southern Negro Youth Congress, with which the subject was affiliated.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks information that, to my knowledge, is not already in the public domain. Of course, without already knowing what records the Bureau has, I can't say for sure whether those records are already in the public domain or what the public would learn from them; however, because Ms. Jackson has recently died, the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Ms. Jackson was a public figure. News obituaries for Ms. Jackson appeared in the Washington Post and the New York Times, among other publications. According to her obituary in the Washington Post (attached): \r\n\r\n\"Ms. Jackson spent decades on the forefront of the movement for racial justice \u2014 and decades more as a repository of knowledge about the social, political and intellectual movements that helped shape the United States in the 20th century. 'Esther Cooper Jackson\u2019s activism in the Black freedom movement spans over [70 years], and her contributions are nearly impossible to quantify,' Sara Rzeszutek, a professor of history at St. Francis College in Brooklyn and the author of a book about Ms. Jackson\u2019s activism, said in an email.\" \r\n\r\nThus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. \r\n\r\nI am also making this request via MuckRock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that will allow anyone in the world to access all responsive records online for free.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Ms. Jackson has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released before. Again, I cannot be 100% sure if factor is satisfied without already knowing what records the Bureau has. However, given Ms. Jackson's status as a public figure, the Bureau should deem this factor satisfied.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government's surveillance of its critics. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nI would prefer that you produce responsive records electronically if possible: by email attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

According to her obituary in the Washington Post (attached):\r\n    \r\n    \"Ms. Jackson spent decades on the forefront of the movement for racial\r\n    justice \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and decades more as a repository of knowledge about the social,\r\n    political and intellectual movements that helped shape the United States in\r\n    the 20th century. 'Esther Cooper Jackson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activism in the Black freedom\r\n    movement spans over [70 years], and her contributions are nearly impossible\r\n    to quantify,' Sara Rzeszutek, a professor of history at St. Francis College\r\n    in Brooklyn and the author of a book about Ms. Jackson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activism, said in\r\n    an email.\"\r\n    \r\n    Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I\r\n    seek.\r\n    \r\n    I am also making this request via MuckRock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site\r\n    that will allow anyone in the world to access all responsive records online\r\n    for free.\r\n    \r\n    4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a\r\n    significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Ms.\r\n    Jackson has recently died\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmeaning that the Bureau can now release responsive\r\n    records that it could not have released before. Again, I cannot be 100% sure\r\n    if factor is satisfied without already knowing what records the Bureau has.\r\n    However, given Ms. Jackson's status as a public figure, the Bureau should\r\n    deem this factor satisfied.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Please See attachment for description.\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation **\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress.

The Bureau states that my request failed to meet at least one of the four public interest factors, but it does not say which factor or factors I failed to satisfy or why. This alone is reason enough to reverse the Bureau's decision, because it makes it impossible for the requestor to meaningfully respond to the denial\u2014rendering the denial arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and a denial of due process.\r\n\r\n2.  My request meets the legal standard for a fee waiver. The subject of the request was a public figure, with news obituaries of her death appearing in major newspapers. Responsive records will be of great interest to historians, political activists, scholars, and all who care about the government's surveillance of political dissidents. I am making this request via MuckRock.com, which will automatically make all responsive records available to the general public for free. There is simply no reason to deny this fee waiver.  \r\n\r\n3. I incorporate by reference the additional arguments I made in my initial request for a fee waiver.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this appeal.\r\n\r\nMost sincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

CBP-FO-2023-115940 \r\nCBP FOIA attempted to call you on 10/12/2023 to discuss your cases, however, the number did not work and kept getting a busy signal. You did not provide custodians for your email searches and to continue processing your request this information is needed. However, CBP FOIA used the top three leadership names in the Rio Grande sector as your custodians so we can continue your search.Provisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations.

Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). Please note that due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, and a current backlog, it may take 6-9 months to receive a response to your FOIA request.

This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information.

This event, part of the Free Palestine and Resistance Movement against Israeli aggression, is referenced in your press release titled \"HCSO Assists USF Police Department Following Unsanctioned Protest.\"\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\r\nDigital Documents:\r\nBody Camera Footage: Complete recordings from body-worn cameras of all officers engaged from the beginning to the end of their deployment at the protest. Legal support: ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012) affirms the public\u2019s right to record public officials in public settings, which supports the disclosure of body camera footage.\r\nRadio Transmissions: All audio recordings and transcripts of radio communications involving law enforcement personnel during the protest. Legal support: Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978) indicates the public interest in accessing law enforcement communications for transparency.\r\nText Communications: All SMS and instant messages sent to and from officers concerning the enforcement activities at the protest. Legal support: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998) supports the release of communications to ensure transparency in governmental operations.\r\nAerial Footage: All video recordings from helicopters, drones, or any other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used during the protest. Legal support: Electronic Frontier Foundation v. Department of Transportation, 2015 (finding that aerial surveillance footage is subject to disclosure under FOIA to allow public analysis of governmental surveillance practices).\r\nPhysical Documents:\r\nIncident Reports and Briefings: All written reports, memos, and briefing documents pertaining to the law enforcement activities during the protest. Legal support: Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989) supports the disclosure of law enforcement records for public scrutiny.\r\nOperational Plans: Documents detailing the strategies and guidelines used for managing the protest. Legal support: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978) demonstrates the public's right to understand the strategic operations of public authorities.\r\nLegal Precedents and Public Interest Justification:\r\n\r\nThe requested information is of significant public interest, particularly concerning government operations at public protests and the specific enforcement tactics employed against movements advocating for international human rights and resistance against oppression. The release of these records will enhance public understanding and facilitate informed community oversight.\r\n\r\nFees and Document Delivery:\r\n\r\nPlease inform me of any potential fees associated with the processing of this request. I request a waiver of all fees as this disclosure is primarily in the public interest, contributing substantially to the understanding of government operations and is not for commercial purposes. I prefer to receive the documents electronically, via email or on a CD-ROM if electronic transfer is impractical.\r\n\r\nResponse Time and Contact:\r\n\r\nI anticipate your response within the statutory timeframe prescribed by law.

The status is still the same as mentioned on September 13, 2023.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour request is now #17 in the queue. I have approximately 148 pages responsive to your request.  This number may change after I finish my review. Please note, I work on requests on a first come first processed basis.  However, I will send you a partial response to you; hopefully, in the next two weeks. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMs. Michelle Moreno\r\n\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\n\r\nShe / Her / Hers\r\n\r\nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service\r\n\r\nLegislative and Public Affairs\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act and Privacy Act\r\n\r\n4700 River Road / Riverdale, MD 20737\r\n\r\nEmail: Michelle.Moreno@USDA.GOV\r\n\r\nPhone: (301) 851-4084\"",

        "communication": "Hi Samantha.\r\n\r\nWe are continuing to process your request. However, we are seeking some clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  You requested Production Support Requests (PSRs) created from 1/1/2023 to 12/31/2023.\r\nThe contract defines PSRs as service requests originating from issues reported by end users required to correct TIERS Suite of Applications data utilizing SQL scripts on the database. Based on this definition, the record count is more than 10,000 records which contain client Personally Identifiable Information/Protected Health Information and must be redacted.\r\n\r\nThe total estimated time to redact the records is over 500 hours, which would require a cost estimate of over $7,000. You can reduce the amount of review time and cost by narrowing your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  You requested Deloitte invoices for contract HHS000045800001 received from 1/1/2023 to 12/31/2023.\r\nSome invoices may include Deloitte's proprietary financial information which would need to be redacted. Would you be amenable to accepting redactions of Deloitte's proprietary financials? If so, you can review the redacted invoices and decide how you'd like to proceed.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to move forward without redacting Deloitte's proprietary financials, we would need to send the documents to the Office of Attorney General for a third party ruling, which generally takes 60-business days.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request for clarification extends the 10-business day deadline by 10 more business days, starting the day after we receive your clarification response. Your open records request will be considered withdrawn if we do not receive a clarification response from you within 61 days from the date of this email.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJennifer Ruffcorn\r\nHHS Office of Communications\r\nPress Officer\r\nPress Hotline: 512-424-6951\r\n\r\n[cid:image009.gif@01DA59E1.9C7E2F80]\r\n\r\n[cid:image010.png@01DA59E1.9C7E2F80]<http://www.facebook.com/TexasHHSC/>   [cid:image011.png@01DA59E1.9C7E2F80] <http://twitter.com/TexasHHSC>    [cid:image012.png@01DA59E1.9C7E2F80] <http://www.instagram.com/texashhsc/>    [cid:image013.png@01DA59E1.9C7E2F80] <http://www.youtube.com/user/TexasHHSC>    [cid:image014.png@01DA59E1.9C7E2F80] <https://www.facebook.com/txhhscenespanol/>    (en espa\u00f1ol)\n",

The calculation is based on standard prescribed by Texas Attorney General with the Public Information Cost Estimate Model<https://www2.texasattorneygeneral.gov/open/cost_calculator.php>.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request for clarification extends the 10-business day deadline by 10 more business days, starting the day after we receive your clarification response. Your open records request will be considered withdrawn if we do not receive a clarification response from you within 61 days from the date of this email.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJennifer Ruffcorn\r\nHHS Office of Communications\r\nPress Officer\r\nPress Hotline: 512-424-6951\r\n\r\n[cid:image008.gif@01DA76D2.0A320170]\r\n\r\n[cid:image009.png@01DA76D2.0A320170]<http://www.facebook.com/TexasHHSC/>   [cid:image010.png@01DA76D2.0A320170] <http://twitter.com/TexasHHSC>    [cid:image011.png@01DA76D2.0A320170] <http://www.instagram.com/texashhsc/>    [cid:image012.png@01DA76D2.0A320170] <http://www.youtube.com/user/TexasHHSC>    [cid:image013.png@01DA76D2.0A320170] <https://www.facebook.com/txhhscenespanol/>    (en espa\u00f1ol)\n",

TEA received a public information request on May 23, regarding  documents and contracts with GoGuardian or Liminex that were active between 1/1/2018 and 5/23/2024. To the extent it exists, the requested information is provided to you with this letter and includes a copy of the original request.\r\n\r\nAttached are spreadsheets reflecting transactions of school district purchases where the districts requested a disbursement of their Instructional Materials and Technology Allotment. Note, TEA does not  maintain records at the state level beyond these transactions.  The contracts are between the school districts or local education agencies and the vendors.\r\n\r\nDistricts and open-enrollment charter schools can use their Instructional Materials and Technology Allotment<https://tea.texas.gov/academics/instructional-materials/2024-2025-instructional-materials-technology-allotment.pdf> (PDF) to order materials through EMAT. The funds can be accessed in two ways: through a requisition for state-adopted materials or through a disbursement request for materials ordered directly from the vendor.\r\nRequisition Process\r\n\r\n  1.  A local education agency (LEA) logs in to EMAT to submit a requisition for state-adopted materials.\r\n  2.  Funds are deducted from the LEA's allotment in EMAT.\r\n  3.  TEA reviews the requisition.\r\n  4.  If approved, TEA sends the order to the publisher. The publisher fulfills the order. TEA pays the publisher.\r\nDisbursement Process\r\n\r\n  1.  LEA logs into EMAT to submit a disbursement request.\r\n  2.  Funds are deducted from the LEA's allotment in EMAT.\r\n  3.  TEA reviews the request and contacts the LEA for additional information if needed.\r\n  4.  If approved, TEA sends the funds to the LEA. The LEA orders directly from the vendor and pays the vendor directly.\r\nTEA pays for interstate and intrastate shipping of instructional materials. Refer to the Freight Information page for shipping details.\r\nThese records represent a \"Disbursement Process\" by an LEA therefore no contact exists between TEA and the vendors.\r\nReferral to another governmental body: The district administrative offices, may have contract information related to your request.  A listing of school district contact information is available in the Texas Education Directory, linked here: http://tea4avholly.tea.state.tx.us/tea.askted.web/Forms/Home.aspx.\r\nThere are no charges for fulfilling this request and PIR # 69130 is considered closed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further, please contact me at (512) 463-3464 or by email at PIR@tea.texas.gov<mailto:PIR@tea.texas.gov>.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Logo  Description automatically generated]\r\nSherry Mansell\r\nPublic Information Coordinator\r\nOffice of General Counsel\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DABCD1.C0B64B50]\r\n512-463-3464\r\n[cid:image003.png@01DABCD1.C0B64B50]\r\npir@tea.texas.gov<mailto:pir@tea.texas.gov>\r\n[Icon  Description automatically generated]\r\nwww.tea.texas.gov<http://www.tea.texas.gov>\r\n\r\nSherry Mansell\r\nPublic Information Coordinator\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\n Original Request\r\n\r\n TEA Responsive Documents\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMacKenzie Orcutt",

        "communication": "Good day,\r\n\r\nThis is in regards to your TSA FOIA request, 2021-TSFO-00418 (see attached). To search for records for this request, it would take a combined search time of 162 hours. We estimate costs of $4,536 for the continued processing of your request. In accordance with the DHS implementing regulations, 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11, fee estimates that exceed $250 may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. If you agree to this fee assessment, we are requesting an advance payment of fifty percent (50%) of the entire current anticipated fee which is $4,536.\r\n\r\nFee Estimate Breakdown:\r\nSearch time at $28 per hour (first two hours are free): $4,536\r\nProfessional review time at $28 per hour: no cost estimate at this time\r\nDuplication is .10 per page: no charge for electronic records\r\n\r\nThis is just an estimate. The final invoice will reflect the actual time expended which could be less than the estimate. If we expect the estimate amount to increase, we will contact you directly before incurring any additional fees. We will provide you with the final invoice with our final release of records.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, you may:\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Provide us with written assurance of your willingness to pay $4,536 for the processing of your request, or\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Agree in writing to pay some additional amount that is lower than our estimate of $4,536 for the processing of your request, and/or\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Reduce the scope of your request, so as to limit the amount of time that would be required to process your request, such that your fee does not exceed the amount that you have agreed to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive your fee agreement within 30 business days of the date of this email, which is June 28, 2021, we will administratively close out your requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like help reformulating your request, please contact me directly at Michael.tobias@tsa.dhs.gov<mailto:Michael.tobias@tsa.dhs.gov>. I am also available for phone meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response regarding your fee agreement by March 24, 2021.\r\n\r\nThank you and have a great day!\r\n\nMichael Tobias\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\r\nTransportation Security Administration (TSA)\r\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) Branch\r\nCRL/OTE/TED",

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\n\u00d6zal was born in Turkey and worked for the State Electrical Power Planning Administration from 1950 to 1952. He studied electrical energy and engineering management in the United States from 1952 to 1953, and returned to Turkey to work for the same government organization until 1958. \u00d6zal worked at the World Bank from 1971 to 1973, served as undersecretary to Prime Minister S\u00fcleyman Demirel from 1979 to 1980 and was appointed state minister and deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs from 1980 to 1982.\r\n\r\n\u1e26e founded the Motherland Party (Turkish: Anavatan Partisi) in 1983. \u00d6zal was elected Prime Minister of Turkey later that year, and served in that office until he became President of Turkey in 1989, later dying in office. \u00d6zal maintained close relations with U.S. President George H.W. Bush throughout the end of the Cold War and the beginning of the post Cold War era.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an investigative journalist who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",

Response:  An initial search indicates that well over three thousand documents may be responsive to this request, which it is estimated will take at least ten hours of staff time to retrieve and review to ensure that no statutory exceptions exist preventing the release or requiring the redaction of documents.  Pursuant to CORA, the first hour is free, and every hour thereafter is charged at $33.58 per hour, for an estimated minimum fee of $302.22.  Please provide payment to the City Clerk\u2019s Office of 50% of the estimated fee, or $151.11 to allow the City to begin processing your request.  The City is extending the time to respond to this request due to the extenuating circumstances, including the City having to devote all or substantially all of its resources to meeting an impending deadline concerning another CORA request, and the large volume of documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinda L.

        "communication": "Thank you for your response. \r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost. \r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate. \r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified. \r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into considideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter",

When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.   You reference \u201canother FOIA request,\u201d and I am advising you that The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (FOIA) applies only to federal agencies and does not create a right of access to records held by local government agencies.  The City is processing your records request pursuant to the Colorado Open Records Act, C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-200.1, et seq. (CORA).  Please note that pursuant to C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-205(3), the City may charge a fee not in excess of the original fee charged to a previous person requesting the same or similar records.  The City\u2019s fees are set by a resolution approved by the City Council and all CORA requests are charged the same fee rate.\r\n\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.  The City\u2019s fees are set by a resolution approved by the City Council and all CORA requests are charged the same fee rate.  The City Council policy does not provide staff with discretion to charge a different fee for different requesting parties.  Electronic copies of records are not charged per page or per record, but rather the fee is based upon the time it takes the staff to research and retrieve the record, which fee is standard and is determined by the City Council by resolution.\r\n\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.  Neither CORA nor the City CORA policy require the City to consider the economic circumstances of the requesting party, and the City does not consider the use to which the requesting party will make of the requested records.\r\n\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified. As stated previously, FOIA is not applicable to the City of Cortez.  The City does not consider the use to which the requesting party will make of the requested records.\r\n\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into considideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.  The City CORA policy and the fees charged are specified by resolution of the City Council, and the staff does not have the discretion to deviate from the fees required in the resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinda L.

Request:  All external and internal documents, emails, minutes that reply to carpenter81321@protnmail.com<mailto:carpenter81321@protnmail.com> or contain the text \u2018Zu Gallery\u2019 from any staff, council or otherwise are subject to the Colorado Open Records Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Response:  An initial search indicates that over fourteen hundred documents may be responsive to this request, and it is estimated it will take City Staff at least nine hours of staff time to retrieve and review to ensure that no statutory exceptions exist preventing the release or requiring the redaction of documents.  Pursuant to CORA, the first hour is free, and every hour thereafter is charged at $33.58 per hour, for an estimated minimum fee for eight hours of $268.64.  If you still desire to have the City process this CORA request, please provide payment to the City Clerk\u2019s Office of 50% of the estimated fee, or $134.32 to allow the City to begin processing your request.  The City has extended the time to respond to this request due to the extenuating circumstances, including the City having to devote all or substantially all of its resources to meeting an impending deadline concerning another CORA request, and the large volume of documents involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinda L.
