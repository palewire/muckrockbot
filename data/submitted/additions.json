        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am requesting information from fourteen years ago regarding DPD records relating to two purported gangs--the \"Hustle Boys\" and the \"Knock Out Boys\" that the Detroit Police Department was in possession of in 2010. This request includes all \"List DPD Narrative\" reports containing these two search terms, as well as the underlying reports from those events contained in that search. For instance, we know the search term \"Hustle Boys\" appears in a 6/18/2009 homicide narrative bearing CRISNET number 0906180015.6 (Supplement 6). We would like the full list of searches, as well as the underlying reports. We are also requesting any Detroit Police Intelligence Data information, to include photos and lists of suspected members of the \"Hustle Boys\" and \"Knock Out Boys\" and any information justifying inclusion of those individual in the organizational chart. For instance, we are aware of a chart containing the names Delmerey Morris and Deonta Morris photos that appears to be a roster of people the Detroit Police believed to be in \"Hustle Boys.\" We are asking for any other versions of that chart and all charts relating to the \"Knock Out Boys\" \r\n\r\nWe are requesting any information regarding the gang affiliations of Tyree Washington, JB Watson, Elmer Allwood, and William Beal, if not included in the materials requested above. \r\n\r\nWe request any intelligence reports or information regarding the date of formation, the gangs' goals, any list of crimes perpetrated by members of, or in furtherance of, the gangs' enterprise, or other information pertaining to these two purported gangs.\r\n\r\nIf any information is not available or has been purged, we request the date of the information purge and other information regarding the identity or the entity purging these documents, or the order to purge this information.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBlase Schmid",
