If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files, memos, emails and other records mentioning or describing John \"Sonny\"\r\n    Franzese Sr. (February 6, 1917 \u2013 February 24, 2020), who was an\r\n    Italian-American mobster who was a longtime member of the Colombo crime\r\n    family.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am a member of the news media as a reporter for Business Insider, and the requested documents are in the public interest and not being made for commercial purposes. Therefore, I ask that all fees are waived in the processing of my request. If fees associated with this request will be in excess of $25, kindly notify me in advance of fulfilling this request. As I am making this request as a journalist and this information is timely, I would appreciate your communicating with me if you have questions regarding this request.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and if there are any questions about my request, can provide any clarification that will help expedite the processing of my request, please contact me at email address. I am also happy to hop on the phone.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your reply within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires and an even more prompt reply if you can make a determination without having to review the records in question.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nCaroline",

While I will not be using these records for commercial purposes as stated in my initial request, I requested copies of notices issued by the City and did not request a list of names. Your interpretation led you to creating a list of names presumably because the original records are not available. Following how you interpret RCW 42.56.070 to apply to my request for City-issued notices, I would expect all public records requests that yield records containing multiple names to be subject to this law. If I were to ask for emails sent by the Mayor's Office (which I have many times without being required to sign an affidavit), you would argue that because multiple senders and recipients appear in the records, I must sign your affidavit. May I remind you that the PRA is to be \"liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed\".\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the law you cite (RCW 42.56.070(8)) only applies to \"lists of individuals\". As seen depicted in this article, the letter is addressed to \"Fortuna Sequitur LLC\" which is the entity that runs the Bait Shop business. Nowhere in this letter do I see the name of any individual listed, so I do not see why the list you are creating would be deemed \"a list of individuals\".\r\nhttps://www.kuow.org/stories/graffiti-was-carved-into-their-windows-the-city-wants-these-seattle-bars-to-fix-it-or-pay-up\r\n\r\nI respectfully ask that I be provided the full breadth of requested information, as is my right under the PRA.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRose",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nIn November of 2016, the Department of Homeland Security amended the agency's Freedom of Information Act regulations under the guise of inter alia, \"streamlining the language of several procedural provisions\". See 81 Fed. Reg. 83625 (Nov. 22, 2016).  The new regulations impose requirements on requestors with respect to describing the records sought that are not found in the text of the Freedom of Information Act. They also allow ICE to administratively close FOIA requests where requestors fail to respond to the agency's assertion that the request is too broad. The regulations provide for no right of appeal of the administratively closure decision. \r\n\r\nFunctionally, these regulatory changes allow ICE to unilaterally assert that a request is too broad or not described with sufficient specificity to allow the agency to conduct a search for records, and then place the burden on the requestor to promptly respond or else have their request shunted into a bureaucratic limbo. In the event the administrative appeal is sustained and the request remanded back to ICE for processing, the agency's FOIA office essentially buys itself a second bite at the Act's timing requirements, with which it is already serially and egregiously non-compliant.\r\n\r\nThe experience of FOIA requestors post-November 2016 has been that the agency's updated regulations offered ICE's FOIA office a pretext to deny or administratively close request that the agency incorrectly and unlawfully characterizes as being \"too broad\".  When requestors have appealed the initial \"too broad\" determination, this determinations are almost uniformly reversed -- calling into question the process by which ICE FOIA makes the determination in the first place. Illustrative examples of this practice, with FOIA case numbers, are attached to this request. \r\n\r\nIn the context of a prior request for any ICE training materials or guidance for determining when a request is too broad, 2017-ICFO-29691, the agency simply directed the requestor to the text of the Freedom of Information Act and DHS's implementing regulations. \r\n\r\nDHS has not publicly disclosed the numbers of \"administratively closed\" requests in its annual reporting to DOJ and Congress. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of several media clients and non-profit organizations, I therefore request the following records: \r\n\r\n1. Any record showing the total number of initial \"too broad\" determination letters ICE FOIA sent to requestors during FY16-19. \r\n2. Any record showing the total number of responses by requestors within the 30-day timeframe set forth in ICE FOIA's \"too broad\" determination letters during FY16-19. \r\n3. Any record showing the total number of FOIA requests ICE administratively closed based on a requestor's failure to respond to the agency's \"too broad\" determinations during FY16-19. \r\n4. Any record showing the total number of administrative appeals  ICE FOIA received challenging the agency's \"too broad\" determinations during FY16-19. \r\n5. Any record showing the total number of remands of administrative appeals of ICE FOIA \"too broad\" determination during FY16-19. \r\n6. Any record showing the total number of FOIA lawsuits filed since November 22, 2016, challenging the agency's \"too broad\" determination, or its decision to administratively close a case for failure to respond to such a letter. \r\n7. Any training, guidance, checklist, template, or other document used by ICE FOIA to document the language in the FOIA request that falls short of the requirements set forth by DHS in 6 C.F.R. 5.3(b). \r\n8. Any communications, reports, dashboards, or modules demonstrating the total number of administratively closed FOIA requests currently pending before ICE based on a \"too broad\" determination.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.\u00a0 As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.\u00a0 We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible.

        "communication": "I hereby appeal the adequacy of the agency's search, and the legality of the agency's withholdings. \r\n\r\nFirst, ICE FOIA claims, incredibly, that it does not maintain records guiding FOIA officers on when a request is \"too broad\" under 6 CFR 5.3(b). This claim, if true, would establish a serious failure in the agency's training and supervision of its FOIA office, and is completely inconsistent with the agency's obligations under the Act. \r\n\r\nSecond, ICE FOIA contends that its 29-page response to Item 3 constitutes the only responsive record it has to this request. As an initial matter, ICE's failure to produce the records in native format (likely a .csv or .xls file) violates the Act. Substantively however, the agency's production of some 1100 requests it says the FOIA office closed as \"too broad\" under 6 C.F.R. 5.3(b) demonstrates why the agency's refusal to search for and produce records responsive to Items 1-2 and 4-8 cannot possibly be true. That's because the 29-page pdf does not contain the terms 'too broad\" or \"5.3(b)\", or any other term that would explain how these particular ~1100 records came to be designated as responsive to Item 3. Clearly, they were printouts from a system of records that ICE FOIA presumably queried. What was the basis for that query? How did that query produce these results? If ICE FOIA is to be believed that it doesn't track or maintain records responsive to Items 1-2 and 4-8, and that these 29 pages are the ONLY responsive documents that would be returned by a search reasonably calculated to lead to all responsive records, how can ICE FOIA explain the lack of any reference to the actual terms of Item 3 in the pdf if produced? \r\n\r\nPlease process this appeal within the period allowed by law and remand to the agency for re-tasking and re-processing consistent with the Act.",

You are seeking appealing the adequacy of the search and withholdings of records regarding several points concerning request deemed as \"too broad\" during FY 2016-2019. \n\nThese documents are on the ICE FOIA library  at https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/policy/manual-ICEFOIAIntakeSOP.pdf \n\nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA Office \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nFreedom of Information Act Office \n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\n\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.  I hereby request the following records:\n\na copy of all emails from the domain EOP.gov to senior managers encompassed within the required agency system for retaining emails of senior officials.  Frequently this records management policy/system is described by the name Capstone.\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs/grs06-1-faqs.html\r\n\r\nIf the agency has not yet established NARA-compliant email retention procedures, then I instead request an electronic search of the mailboxes of agency senior managers for all emails that include the EOP.gov phrase in the FROM address.\r\n\r\nI limit this request to the time period January 20, 2017 to the present.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael Best",

Doing so would remove approximately 1685 pages.

We would be happy to make this reduction for you, but would ask that you consider making a further reduction to move the request into one of the faster tracks. Would you possibly be willing to reduce the request to up to 950 pages to move the request into the medium track? You are always welcome to request additional material once a release has been made. We could take the first 950 pages, the last 950, or split between the beginning and end of the file if you would like.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to move forward.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFBI FOIA Negotiation Team\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nfbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n540-868-1695",

Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak",

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10 \r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan",

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798%252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850%252F%253Femail%253DEEA.RAO%252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE%3A1sTaIV%3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https*3A*2F*2Fwww.muckrock.com*2Faccounts*2Flogin*2F*3Fnext*3D*252Faccounts*252Fagency_login*252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798*252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850*252F*253Femail*253DEEA.RAO*252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE*3A1sTaIV*3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUl!!CPANwP4y!SgvkplBeCbj7sYOw4pqQGHG73O1NerrphpwAUSubANJm6y4K2_gMxaYflq7D4NERhsWt0PP0gngAJgd9fEAY_dSs1AvBu_6syUk$>\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nMMCVXYVJ\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 151850\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798%252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850%252F%253Femail%253DEEA.RAO%252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE%3A1sTaIV%3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https*3A*2F*2Fwww.muckrock.com*2Faccounts*2Flogin*2F*3Fnext*3D*252Faccounts*252Fagency_login*252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798*252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850*252F*253Femail*253DEEA.RAO*252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE*3A1sTaIV*3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUl!!CPANwP4y!SgvkplBeCbj7sYOw4pqQGHG73O1NerrphpwAUSubANJm6y4K2_gMxaYflq7D4NERhsWt0PP0gngAJgd9fEAY_dSs1AvBu_6syUk$>\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nMMCVXYVJ\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 151850\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798%252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850%252F%253Femail%253DEEA.RAO%252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE%3A1sTaIV%3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https*3A*2F*2Fwww.muckrock.com*2Faccounts*2Flogin*2F*3Fnext*3D*252Faccounts*252Fagency_login*252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798*252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850*252F*253Femail*253DEEA.RAO*252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE*3A1sTaIV*3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUl!!CPANwP4y!SgvkplBeCbj7sYOw4pqQGHG73O1NerrphpwAUSubANJm6y4K2_gMxaYflq7D4NERhsWt0PP0gngAJgd9fEAY_dSs1AvBu_6syUk$><https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https*3A*2F*2Fwww.muckrock.com*2Faccounts*2Flogin*2F*3Fnext*3D*252Faccounts*252Fagency_login*252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798*252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850*252F*253Femail*253DEEA.RAO*252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE*3A1sTaIV*3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k*3Chttps:**Aurldefense.com*v3*__https:*accounts.muckrock.com*accounts*login**Anext=https*3A*2F*2Fwww.muckrock.com*2Faccounts*2Flogin*2F*3Fnext*3D*252Faccounts*252Fagency_login*252Fexecutive-office-energy-and-environmental-affairs-798*252Fmemorial-drive-aftermath-151850*252F*253Femail*253DEEA.RAO*252540mass.gov&url_auth_token=AAAKp_WMLseQvhZNhZvI3sF11JE*3A1sTaIV*3AN6wweyJ95prcdCK0dyR9rVcoGgTwiKpasSgVu9qzC4k__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUl!!CPANwP4y!SgvkplBeCbj7sYOw4pqQGHG73O1NerrphpwAUSubANJm6y4K2_gMxaYflq7D4NERhsWt0PP0gngAJgd9fEAY_dSs1AvBu_6syUk$*3E__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJSUlJS8vLy8vLy8vPyoqKioqKioqKioqKioqKioqKiU!!CPANwP4y!UBixvChSzZuUs5KFozrknGGJ4UqV52lUKWbcYKLLr8QHeo8_2ISfFLwgSJ_9Zh0_J0Iw6qfhSY4t4hsTrU6ikJMM45bCFdUaIqw$>\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nMMCVXYVJ\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com%3cmailto:151850-69656655@requests.muckrock.com>>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 151850\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

Are you intending to start a new search or to use the results of these previous searches?\r\n\r\nI appreciate that it takes time to review records, so I remain happy to discuss modifications of search terms.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th.

Lacking a response I plan on initiating an appeal next week. This on the basis of the public records law, which, as you may know requires that:\r\n\r\n\"If the RAO intends to produce records and is able to do so within 10 business days, it must \u201cat reasonable times and without unreasonable delay\u201d permit inspection or furnish a copy of any public record not later than 10 business days following the receipt of the request.9 The RAO must do so provided that:\r\n(i) the request reasonably describes the public record sought;\r\n(ii) the public record is within the possession, custody or control of the agency or municipality that the records access officer serves; and\r\n(iii) the records access officer receives payment of a reasonable fee as set forth in subsection (d) of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.10\r\n\r\nIf the agency or municipality does not intend to produce records, or if it is unable to produce records within 10 business because the magnitude or difficulty of the request or if multiple requests from the same requestor unduly burdens the other responsibilities of the agency or municipality, the agency or municipality must provide a written response to the requestor within 10 business days of receiving the request.\r\n\r\n(from https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/public-records/download/guide.pdf)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nIan\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2023:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Memorial Drive Aftermath\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n- Emails sent or received between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive) containing the any of the following search terms (with any capitalization and without quotes): \"Marjorie\", \"Decker\", \"Memorial\", \"Riverbend\", \"DCR\"\r\n- Emails sent to or received from State Rep Marjorie Decker or her aides between July 24, 2023 to August 1, 2023 (inclusive)\r\n- Logs of calls made or received by Secretary Tepper on July 24, 25th, and 26th. Including: The date and time the call occurred, call length and the phone number that called or was called. Including calls that were received by a general line or aide that were then transferred or otherwise passed to Secretary Tepper\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Hunt-Isaak\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive

Below is the email of the request you submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Records Access Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law (Public Officers Law \u00a7\u00a7 84-90), I hereby request access to the following records related to the Town of Fishkill's handling of FOIL requests and exemption determinations:\r\n\r\nRequested Information:\r\n\r\n1. Policies and Procedures:\r\n* All documents detailing the policies and procedures used by the Town of Fishkill to determine FOIL exemptions, including any internal guidelines, manuals, or training materials provided to staff responsible for processing FOIL requests.\r\n2. Exemption Criteria:\r\n* Any documentation outlining the criteria and standards applied when deciding whether a particular record or portion of a record qualifies for an exemption under FOIL.\r\n3. Training Records:\r\n* Records of any training sessions or workshops conducted for staff on the topic of FOIL request handling and exemption determination, including dates, agendas, and materials used or distributed during such training.\r\n4. Decision Records:\r\n* Any internal communications, memoranda, or meeting notes discussing specific FOIL requests and the decision-making process regarding the application of exemptions. This includes communications involving the Records Access Officer, legal counsel, or other relevant officials.\r\n5. Precedent Records:\r\n* Copies of previous FOIL request responses where exemptions were applied, including the justifications provided for each exemption, to understand how similar requests have been handled historically.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nIn accordance with the New York Freedom of Information Law, I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request. The disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest as it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities and is not primarily in my commercial interest.\r\n\r\nThis information is essential to understand the Town of Fishkill's approach to transparency and public access to information. It will contribute to the public's ability to assess the fairness and consistency of FOIL request handling. Should there be any fees associated with this request, despite the waiver request, please inform me of the total charges in advance. I would prefer the request to be fulfilled electronically via email, but I am also open to receiving the information in other formats if necessary.\r\n\r\nI anticipate your response within the statutory timeframe prescribed by law. Should you require any clarification or have questions regarding this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided phone number or email address.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention and cooperation. I look forward to your prompt and thorough handling of this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nBecki Tompkins, MMC, RMC, CTO\r\nTown of Fishkill\r\nTown Clerk\r\n845-831-7800 ext. 3333 | btompkins@fishkill-ny.gov<mailto:btompkins@fishkill-ny.gov>\n807 Route 52, Fishkill, NY 12524\r\nwww.fishkill-ny.gov<http://www.fishkill-ny.gov/>\r\n[180F9896]<facebook.com/fishkilltownny>",

Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action. \r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force. \r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes: \r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm]. \r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 360 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Spigner was a politician in Queens, New York who served in the New York City Council from 1974 through 2001.\r\n\r\nSpigner's death was widely reported in 2020 (see attachment). I assert that the privacy interests recognized under FOIA Exemption 6, 7(C) as well as the Privacy Act are diminished, and are outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of records pertaining to Spigner as a public figure. \r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Mr. Hefner was born in Chicago, Illinois. He served in the U.S. Army from 1944 to 1946 and achieved the rank of private first class (PFC). The requested records include performance reports, job assessments, disciplinary records, training received, discharge papers, and any other releasable records.\r\n\r\nThe public interest in Mr. Hefner, the founder of \"Playboy\" magazine, should favor disclosure of many of these records, particularly in relation to any disciplinary records, should those records exist.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to review and release any segregable information, even if certain documents or portions of documents are withheld.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not a next of kin of this servicemember, and thus do not know Mr. Hefner\u2019s Social Security Number. Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s relevant provisions. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

That is, the OMPF has been transferred by\r\nthe originating military service department to the legal custody of the\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration (NARA).\r\n\r\nAmong these are the OMPFs of many prominent individuals such as military\r\nheroes, political leaders, cultural figures, celebrities, and entertainers.\r\nThese records, designated as files of Persons of Exceptional Prominence, or\r\nPEPs, are some of the most intrinsically valuable holdings in the NARA\r\nsystem today.\r\n\r\nThe requested PEP OMPF is now a public record.  You may gain access to this\r\nrecord and its contents by purchasing high-resolution scans of the file.\r\nThe NARA staff does not respond to requests for archival records by\r\nfurnishing selected documents or extracts of information such as the\r\ninformation typically provided through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\r\nrequest.\r\nYou will receive an email from Pay.gov regarding access to your bill\r\nonline.  Simply go to the link provided and enter the Access Code listed in\r\nthe email.  You will be prompted to answer a security question.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the security question is: 4267\r\n\r\nPlease submit your payment within 30 days.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions regarding Pay.gov, please contact their customer\r\nservice at 800-624-1373 or pay.gov.clev@clev.frb.org.  If you have\r\nquestions regarding your records order, please contact the National\r\nArchives at St. Louis.\r\n\r\nOnce payment is received, a high-resolution PDF scan of the record will be\r\nmade (Please allow 30 days for the scanning and uploading process to be\r\ncompleted), and a link to access the digital copy of the record will be\r\nemailed to you at 167829-21634267@requests.muckrock.com.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

It is a complex and time-consuming process.\r\n\r\nI am confident that we will have documents ready to provide on or before the December 6th, 2023, date noted in our recent communication.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience!\r\nRegards,\r\nRenee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA121F.C2136CB0]",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (CPRA) to the  Fresno County Probation Department  from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) for records related to AB 2448 (CA Welf & Inst Code \u00a7 851.1. Online:  https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/welfare-and-institutions-code/wic-sect-851-1/), a 2018 law that requires juvenile detention facilities to provide youth in custody with internet access.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this law establishes the following requirements for juvenile detention facilities: \r\n\r\n\u201cMinors detained in or committed to a juvenile hall shall be provided with access to computer technology and the Internet for the purposes of education.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe law also allows juvenile halls to provide access to computers and the internet for \u201cmaintaining relationships with family.\u201d The Chief Probation Officer, or their designee, may \u201climit or deny access to computer technology or the Internet for safety and security or staffing reasons.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe request the following Fresno County Probation Department records: \r\n\r\n1. All policies, procedures, practices, manuals, memorandums, orders or related documents that discuss providing minors in juvenile hall with access to computer technology and the internet for educational purposes; \r\n2. All policies, procedures, practices, manuals, memorandums, orders or related documents that discuss providing minors in juvenile hall with access to computer technology and the internet for maintaining familial relationships; \r\n3. All handbooks or similar documents provided to teachers and other instructors that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet in juvenile hall; \r\n4. All handbooks or similar documents provided to minors in juvenile hall that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet; \r\n5. All procurement records, such as RFPs, RFIs, solicitations, successful bids, and contracts/agreements with vendors for technology systems to provide minors in juvenile hall with access to computing and internet-connected technology; \r\n6. Examples of any consent, permission, and similar documents provided to parents and guardians of minors in juvenile hall related to access to computer technology and the internet;\r\n7. Any quarterly, annual, or other periodic reports that summarize the implementation of programs to comply with AB 2448 generated since 2018;\r\n8. Logs, records, or orders related to suspension of internet access, for any amount of time, \u201cfor safety and security or staffing reasons\u201d since 2018; and\r\n9. Aggregate data on the number of juvenile users of computer technology and internet systems for the period 2022 and 2023.\r\n\r\nShould these records not exist, we would appreciate a statement as to whether the agency is in compliance with AB 2448. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we request the following information and assistance, as required under CPRA: \r\n- Assistance in identifying additional records and information that will assist us in understanding the state of the agency\u2019s compliance with AB 2448;\r\n- A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist; and\r\n- Suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records and information sought. \r\n\r\nThe CPRA also requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available.\r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $50.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $50.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the Muckrock.com email above or my direct email, dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy St. San Francisco, CA, 94109, or leave a voicemail message at 415-436-9333 x151.                                          \r\nSincerely,\r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The fourth federal law, 18 U.S.C. 1918 provides penalties for violation of oath office described in 5 U.S.C. 7311 which include: (1) removal from office and; (2) confinement or a fine.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
