EDCs are estimates and subject to change.  If this request can be completed before   the EDC, a response will be sent sooner.\r\n\r\nAs you were previously advised, the Department currently has a backlog of FOIA requests.

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find his New York Times obituary at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/obituaries/howard-fineman-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files.

I am an investigative journalist who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

That bulletin advised local agencies to be prepared in the event the calls target Nebraska schools.\r\n\r\n- I am looking for a copy of this bulletin\r\n- emails, communications, internal memos or directives about false reports of active shootings or swattings in the last year.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

This would give me the license number for that dealer, in this\r\ncase 44485.  I would then search for any complaints we have associated with\r\nthat license number.  I would then go into OnBase and search for\r\ninvestigations based on that license number.  I would cross reference the\r\ncomplaints from MLO with the results in OnBase to make sure they agree.  I\r\nthen printed all of the reports associated with the cases with the\r\nexception of the case that was presented to the Motor Vehicle Dealer\r\nBoard.  For that case I provided the affidavit of probable cause instead of\r\nthe report.  I then provided all of these reports and the affidavit to the\r\nCORA staff in order for them to be redacted and provided to the requestor*.\r\n\r\n\r\n Muckrock ORA comms Redacted\r\n<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ico0cVAh_xQxxQRqSO1_UVLQsayGwmzE>\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMelissa\r\n*Department of Revenue CORA Manager/Administrator*\r\nwww.colorado.gov/revenue/cora",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Barbara Thomas Judge.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I ask that all fields \u2014 including the date, requester, description and disposition \u2014 are included. Based on our initial review, we believe we cannot process your request within the statutory 20 workdays because our organization has a significant number of pending FOIA requests.\u00a0 To ensure all requesters are properly served in the order their requests were received, we have instituted multitrack processing of requests.\u00a0 Based on the information you provided, we have placed your request in the complex track. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) provides for the collection of fees based on the costs of processing a FOIA request and your fee category.\u00a0 Based upon the information provided in your request, we have placed you in the Other category. We have assigned number 2023-00941-F to identify your request; should you need to contact us about your request.\u00a0 Please direct your questions to the HAF FOIA team at SAF.AA.HAF.FOIA.Workflow@us.af.mil and use this assigned number to assist us in responding more promptly. We will strive to provide an update between 90 and 120 days.\u00a0 Our policy is to process requests within their respective tracks in the order in which they were received in accordance with 32 CFR, Part 286.8.\u00a0 We will notify you in writing if additional processing time is required.\u00a0 We do process each FOIA request as quickly as possible, however delayed responses can be expected.

Please be advised that this correspondence will serve to close this record with our office as permitted by law.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery Truly Yours,\r\n\r\n/s/ Mary Ellen Ramage\r\n\r\nMary Ellen Ramage, Secretary-Manager\r\nBorough of Etna\r\n437 Butler Street\r\nPittsburgh, PA 15223\r\n412-781-0569\r\n\r\nBenjamin E.

The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Gerald Shur.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nEFOIA Request\r\n\r\nI was seeking the release of all files related to the Historic 'Sharebeast' case as highlighted by the quoted press release from the Department of Justice.\r\n\r\nOwner of Sharebeast.com sentenced for copyright infringement\r\n\r\nATLANTA - Artur Sargsyan has been sentenced for the crime of criminal copyright infringement for private financial gain while operating a massive file-sharing infrastructure that distributed approximately 1 billion copies of copyrighted musical works through Internet downloads.  Sargsyan\u2019s file-sharing websites, which contained numerous pop-up advertisements, generated significant profit for him when visitors accessed the websites to illegally download copyrighted works.\r\n\r\n\u201cSargsyan operated one of the most successful illegal music sharing websites on the Internet,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak.  \u201cHis reproduction of copyrighted musical works were made available only to generate undeserved profits for himself.  The incredible work done by our law enforcement partners and prosecutors in light of the complexity of Sargsyan\u2019s operation demonstrates that we will employ all of our resources to stop this kind of theft.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sargsyan was warned several times that he was violating the law by illegally sharing copyrighted works, but chose to ignore those warnings,\u201d said David J. LaValley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. \u201cHis sentence sends a message that no matter how complex the operation, the FBI, its federal partners and law enforcement partners around the globe will go to every length to protect the property of hard working artists and the companies that produce their art.\u201d  \r\n\r\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges and other information presented in court: Artur Sargsyan owned and operated a number of websites including Sharebeast.com, Newjams.net, and Albumjams.com.  From at least 2012 through 2015, Sargsyan illegally distributed and reproduced copyrighted works through Sharebeast.com.  Using a network of websites that he owned and operated, including Newjams.net and Albumjams.com, Sargsyan created links to a wide swath of copyright-protected music that was stored on Sharebeast.com.  Sharebeast illegally stored and distributed works from scores of artists, including Bruno Mars, Linkin Park, Pitbull, Pharrell Williams, Gwen Stefani, Maroon 5, Ariana Grande, Destiny\u2019s Child, Ciara, Katy Perry, Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, Kanye West, and Justin Bieber.  Meanwhile, Sargsyan profited from the distribution of the copies of these copyrighted works.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America (\u201cRIAA\u201d), Sharebeast.com was the largest online file-sharing website specializing in the reproduction and distribution of infringing copies of copyrighted music operating out of the United States.  From 2012 to 2015, the RIAA sent Sargsyan over 100 e-mails notifying him that Sharebeast.com was illegally hosting and sharing copyright-infringing works.  Sargsyan continued, however, to make the copyright-infringing files available for download, disregarding the many warnings that he received.  The RIAA conservatively estimated the total monetary loss to its member companies at $6.3 billion.\r\n\r\nArtur Sargsyan, 30, of Glendale, California, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr., to five years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $458,200.  He was also ordered to forfeit $184,768.87.  Sargsyan was convicted on these charges on September 1, 2017, after he pleaded guilty.\r\n\r\nThis case was investigated by the FBI.\r\n\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Samir Kaushal and Kamal Ghali prosecuted the case.  John Zacharia, formerly the Deputy Chief for Litigation for the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, previously prosecuted the case.  The prosecution reflects a coordinated effort by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS), the Office of International Affairs, the FBI\u2019s field offices in Atlanta, Denver, Chicago, and Los Angeles, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California.  Substantial assistance was provided by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency and the Ministry of Security and Justice in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nFor further information please contact the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Public Affairs Office at USAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.gov or (404) 581-6016.  The Internet address for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia is http://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga.\r\n\r\nVAUGHN Index requested for any materials cited in exemption.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWilliam Fernandes",

Sargsyan\u2019s file-sharing websites, which contained numerous pop-up advertisements, generated significant profit for him when visitors accessed the websites to illegally download copyrighted works.\r\n\r\n\u201cSargsyan operated one of the most successful illegal music sharing websites on the Internet,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak. \u201cHis reproduction of copyrighted musical works were made available only to generate undeserved profits for himself. The incredible work done by our law enforcement partners and prosecutors in light of the complexity of Sargsyan\u2019s operation demonstrates that we will employ all of our resources to stop this kind of theft.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sargsyan was warned several times that he was violating the law by illegally sharing copyrighted works, but chose to ignore those warnings,\u201d said David J. LaValley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. \u201cHis sentence sends a message that no matter how complex the operation, the FBI, its federal partners and law enforcement partners around the globe will go to every length to protect the property of hard working artists and the companies that produce their art.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges and other information presented in court: Artur Sargsyan owned and operated a number of websites including Sharebeast.com, Newjams.net, and Albumjams.com. From at least 2012 through 2015, Sargsyan illegally distributed and reproduced copyrighted works through Sharebeast.com. Using a network of websites that he owned and operated, including Newjams.net and Albumjams.com, Sargsyan created links to a wide swath of copyright-protected music that was stored on Sharebeast.com. Sharebeast illegally stored and distributed works from scores of artists, including Bruno Mars, Linkin Park, Pitbull, Pharrell Williams, Gwen Stefani, Maroon 5, Ariana Grande, Destiny\u2019s Child, Ciara, Katy Perry, Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, Kanye West, and Justin Bieber. Meanwhile, Sargsyan profited from the distribution of the copies of these copyrighted works.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America (\u201cRIAA\u201d), Sharebeast.com was the largest online file-sharing website specializing in the reproduction and distribution of infringing copies of copyrighted music operating out of the United States. From 2012 to 2015, the RIAA sent Sargsyan over 100 e-mails notifying him that Sharebeast.com was illegally hosting and sharing copyright-infringing works. Sargsyan continued, however, to make the copyright-infringing files available for download, disregarding the many warnings that he received. The RIAA conservatively estimated the total monetary loss to its member companies at $6.3 billion.\r\n\r\nArtur Sargsyan, 30, of Glendale, California, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr., to five years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $458,200. He was also ordered to forfeit $184,768.87. Sargsyan was convicted on these charges on September 1, 2017, after he pleaded guilty.\r\n\r\nThis case was investigated by the FBI.\r\n\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Samir Kaushal and Kamal Ghali prosecuted the case. John Zacharia, formerly the Deputy Chief for Litigation for the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, previously prosecuted the case. The prosecution reflects a coordinated effort by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS), the Office of International Affairs, the FBI\u2019s field offices in Atlanta, Denver, Chicago, and Los Angeles, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California. Substantial assistance was provided by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency and the Ministry of Security and Justice in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nFor further information please contact the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Public Affairs Office at USAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.gov or (404) 581-6016. The Internet address for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia is http://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga.\r\n\r\nVAUGHN Index requested for any materials cited in exemption.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWilliam Fernandes\r\n///////",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. All agency records pertaining to the decision by the Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) for the Middle District of Georgia (MDGa), to decline the recommended prosecution of former CoreCivic employee Freddy Wims for making false statements under oath in connection with the investigation of the death of Jeancarlo Alfonso Jimenez Joseph at the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, GA, on May 15, 2017, including, but not limited to, the Declination Memo created by the USAO MDGa. \r\n\r\n2. All agency records created or reviewed in connection with the following FOIA requests: \"CRM-3006-97176\"; EOUSA-2019-002865; A-2020-01304. \r\n\r\nPlease note the following history of the agency's failure to task an adequate search in response to similar previous requests: \r\nA. First, on May 8, 2019, I requested records from the DOJ Criminal Division pertaining to the declination of prosecution by the USAO for the MDGa. (See: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/doj-records-of-the-dhs-oigs-criminal-investigation-of-jean-jimenezs-death-department-of-justice-criminal-division-72898/#comms). DOJ acknowledged receiving this request on May 22, 2019, and assigned it a tracking number of CRM-3006-97176. In its May 22, 2019, acknowledgement letter, DOJ FOIA requested clarification as to the records requested. I provided the requested clarification the same day, indicating that because prosecution was declined, no case number was publicly available. Consequently, on July 5, 2019, DOJ-CRIM concluded my original request was \"misdirected\" and transferred that request to the Executive Office of United States Attorneys (EOUSA) and informed me it was treating the response as final and the case closed. I did not administratively appeal that determination because it appeared that DOJ-CRIM did not have responsive records, EOUSA did, and that EOUSA would commence a search for these records after it received DOJ-CRIM's intra-agency referral. To the best of my knowledge, I have never received an acknowledgement or individualized tracking number from EOUSA following DOJ-CRIM's July 5, 2019, referral of my May 8, 2019, \"misdirected\" request to EOUSA. \r\n\r\n2. Second, on May 8, 2019, I requested records from the EOUSA (independently from the referral by DOJ-CRIM). That request is available here: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/doj-records-of-the-dhs-oigs-criminal-investigation-of-jean-jimenezs-death-department-of-justice-executive-office-for-united-states-attorneys-72899/. On May 16, 2019, EOUSA acknowledged receipt of this request and assigned it tracking number EOUSA-2019-002865. On July 8, 2019, EOUSA informed me that it had conducted a search of the USAO for the Northern District of Georgia and located no responsive records. I replied on July 17, 2019,  by pointing out that the USAO MDGa had not been searched. EOUSA provided no response. On June 3, 2020, I administratively appealed the constructive denial of my FOIA request, which EOUSA assigned tracking number A-2020-01304. On July 20, 2020, EOUSA denied the appeal, determining it was untimely, because it was not filed within the 90-day period after EOUSA's July 8, 2019 decision. \r\n\r\nBased on the above, a currently-pending referral from DOJ-Crim to EOUSA of my \"misdirected\" request, which DOJ-CRIM initiated no later than July 5, 2019, remains unacknowledged and pending within EOUSA's FOIA files. I seek records responsive to that referral on an expedited basis, given that DOJ FOIA has failed to properly acknowledged the intra-agency transfer for nearly 3 years. \r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me at Andrew@DetentionKills.org if I can provide any clarification or additional information regarding this time-sensitive request. \r\n\r\nI make this request on behalf of the #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative, a project of Al Otro Lado. Its purpose is to inform the public of actual and alleged criminal wrongdoing by government contractors which DOJ officials have declined to prosecute. \r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this time-sensitive matter. \r\n\r\nBest regards, \r\n\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Please retask an adequate search that proceeds iteratively and addresses these positive indicia of overlooked materials. \r\n\r\nThe redactions under Exemption 5 of factual information, such as the acronym \u201cROI\u201d, and the redactions under Exemptions 6 and 7C are not supported by a legal and factual analysis of these records. \r\n\r\nFinally no cognizable foreseeable harm applies to the release of this information. \r\n\r\nYour office previously denied an administrative appeal on the basis that we had been given the 62-page release on October 5, 2022. We messaged you repeatedly because we never received these records. Instead of providing them, you asserted for the first time that they were not released to us, but rather, referred to DHS-OIG. Please reopen our prior appeal and reverse the affirmance. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Redacted is private information and unique identifiers contained within public records that could identify or de-identify a student pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b) and 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) (quoted above). Student records are exempt from disclosure pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5(r) Information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act. Additionally, identifiable student information included within records are exempt from disclosure pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5(r) in accordance with Illinois Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at its direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored. 105 ILCS 10/(d): Release of a minor\u2019s record may only be authorized by the parent or guardian in accordance with the Illinois student Records Act (105 ILCS 10/1 et seq.). Pursuant to 20 U.S. Code \u00a7 1232g (b)(1) and (b)(2)(A): The parent or eligible student shall provide a signed and dated written consent before an educational agency or institution discloses personally identifiable information from the student\u2019s education records, except as provided in \u00a799.31. (b) The written consent must: (1) Specify the records that may be disclosed; (2) State the purpose of the disclosure; and (3) Identify the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure may be made. In case of denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706 . You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

        "communication": "I appreciate the update. However, I object to the excessive delay (90 business days) in responding to my request. At least some of the records I am requesting were previously posted on the Department's website (https://web.archive.org/web/20160530052744/http://labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/wageboard2015.shtm). Although this page has since been removed, I believe that the Department still holds these records. Indeed, I confirmed with the New York State Archives that they have not received any documents relating to the Fast Food Wage Board.\r\n\r\nI ask that you expedite at least the release of the recordings of the 2015 Fast Food Wage Board meetings. Again, these recordings were previously posted on the Department's website, which suggests that they are of considerable interest to the public and do not require any review or redactions by your staff. Your own FOIL guidelines state that the timeline for responding to a request depends on \"the number of documents you request, their format, their availability, the time it takes to redact any information that cannot be disclosed pursuant to FOIL, the time it takes to assemble the documents, and other factors.\" (Quoted from the Process section of https://dol.ny.gov/freedom-information-law-foil-requests). These request-specific factors bely the claim in your extension message that you have an \"obligation to treat each request equally.\" Since the previously public Fast Food Wage Board documents do not need redactions or reformatting, it seems reasonable to expect that you can release them with a minimum of staff time.

Your request mentioned: \u201cTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nAll documents provided to Randy Mastro of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, LLP in response to FOIL requests he submitted in 2015. I do not know the tracking number(s), but one such request was submitted to the Office of the Governor on 7/29/2015 for documents pertaining to the Fast Food Wage Board. The requested records include \"all documents relating to the selection of the members of the Fast Food Wage Board\" and \"all documents relating to any Fast Food Wage Board meeting, hearing, or event.\" \r\n\r\nNote that I am also submitting my request to the New York State Department of Labor since some of the responsive records may be maintained by that agency rather than the Governor's Office. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

First I was told 20 business days, then 90, then 30, now (another) 90. Is it too much to ask for a single accurate estimate? How many months did it take you to respond to the requests you closed most recently?

The requested records include recordings of\r\npublic hearings and testimony previously available on the DOL website\r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20160530052744/http://labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/wageboard2015.shtm>.\r\nThe\r\ntracking number for my request is R001184-092523.\r\n\r\nI submitted my request on September 25, 2023 but have yet to receive any\r\nrecords or reasonable estimate of when the records will be available\r\n(again). I was initially given an estimate of 20 business days. A month\r\nlater, the estimate was extended by 90 days. After 90 days, it was pushed\r\nback by 30 days. Most recently, I was given another estimate of 90 business\r\ndays. I have attached the full message history related to this request.\r\n\r\nI do not consider the estimates provided to me reasonable under the\r\ncircumstances of the request. It has been over six months since I submitted\r\nmy request and three estimates have expired with no explanation. Please\r\nnote that no redactions or reformatting should be required for records\r\npreviously released in response to Randy Mastro's 2015 FOIL request or\r\npublished to a public webpage. I kindly ask that you provide me with a\r\nreasonable estimate taking into account the nature of my request and the\r\ntime it took the Department to respond to similar recent requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n*Peter Fugiel, PhD* | Postdoctoral Research Fellow\r\n\r\nDepartment of Labor Studies and Employment Relations\r\n\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations\n",

The search parameters you provided yielded an initial count of approximately 2,440 emails and attachments.

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPlease be advised that certain student and parent/guardian information was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(j)(iii) exempts from release information concerning a school or university\u2019s adjudication of student disciplinary cases, but only to the extent that disclosure would unavoidably reveal the identity of the student. \r\nSection 7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).
