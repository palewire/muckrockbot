FOIA does not impose an unbounded obligation to create requested information in a way that is usable or convenient for the requester. ACUS always attempts to provide records in the requested format, but that is not always possible. This reply is our best effort to provide you with the information without having to pay contractors to manipulate or present the information in your desired format.  There are no in-house IT personnel at our micro agency.\r\n\r\nYou will find attached two Outlook files-both sent to you yesterday in .pdf format. One file was modified to remove PII (after forwarding the document to myself so that it could be redacted). All links and such should be active. The redacted .pdf attachment to the redacted email was sent to you yesterday.\r\n\r\nAs for item 4, you specifically noted that ACUS could reply in a statement, which we did. ACUS has zero FTEs.  I attached the information about the FOIA.gov webpage as a convenience to you. If you have questions about that webpage, you should contact the Office of Information Policy at DOJ since they maintain the webpage.\r\n\r\nFinally, you requested that the documents be uploaded to some sort of database for which you provided a link.  It is a security risk to click on links from unknown sources. In any event, FOIA does not require agencies to plug their responses into a requester's database.\r\n\r\n\r\nShawne C.

To the extent that\r\nthe County\u2019s Purchasing Department has responsive documents, I will review\r\neach document and determine if there is confidential commercial or\r\nfinancial information from the vendor(s) that needs to be withheld or\r\nredacted from production pursuant to MPIA \u00a74-335. This includes certain\r\npricing data and information regarding a vendor\u2019s equipment or processes. A\r\nvendor would customarily not release such information to the public. I\r\nwould produce any responsive contractual documents with such confidential\r\ncommercial or financial information either withheld or redacted. With\r\nregard to the time it is taking to make the records available to you, we\r\nshall first notify the contractor of your request as a courtesy to them and\r\nto allow them a reasonable amount of time to determine what they believe is\r\nproprietary information in their proposal.\r\n\r\nYou may contact the Public Access Ombudsman per MPIA \u00a7 4-1B-04 regarding an\r\nissue you have with this response.

Your reply objects to the City's denial of access pursuant to OPRA's security exemption and based upon protecting the citizens' reasonable expectation of privacy who attended the Teaneck demonstration held on March 10, 2024.  The City evaluated its prior response in light of your reply, and its position remains that you are not legally entitled to access the requested materials.  In addition to the reasons set forth in the City's March 14, 2024 response, an additional reason that the requested materials are exempt from public access is that the underlying footage constitutes law enforcement records relating to citizens who were neither arrested nor charged.  See Fuster v. Twp. of Chatham, 477 N.J. Super. 477 (App. Div. 2023) (determining that government records involving a person who has not been arrested or charged with an offense are entitled to confidentiality based upon long-established judicial precedent).  As such, the City is legally precluded from releasing any footage of citizens generated during the March 10th demonstration.  We trust that this correspondence satisfies your concerns, and we again note that the City is closing out your OPRA request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor O'Brien (she/her)\r\nCity Clerk's Office - OPRA Clerk\r\n65 Central Avenue, 3rd Floor\r\nHackensack, NJ 07601\r\n(P): 201-646-3940\r\n(F): 201-457-1466\r\ntobrien@hackensack.org<mailto:tobrien@hackensack.org>",

There is no obligation for us to continue producing records that are not being collected by a requester. \r\nRCW 42.56.120(4) states that if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. \r\nWAC 44-14-04006(1) states that a records request has been fulfilled and can be closed if an entirely unclear request has not been clarified, a request or installment has not been claimed or reviewed, or the requestor cancels the request.

I also request any communications between the Port of Seattle and CBP pertaining to such OMB approvals, OMB control numbers, or PRA notices \nCBP is granting your request under the FOIA, Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.  Upon initial review of your request, we have determined that the following documents can be found on the internet at the following link: \nFacial Recognition Technology | U.S. Customs and Border Protection (https://www.cbp.gov/document/foia-record/facial-recognition-technology) \n\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account], mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. \nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \n\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \n\nPlease notate file number CBP-2020-041145 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \n\nSincerely, \n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 853 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,786 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,500 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Galante,\r\n\r\nThis is in reference to your FOIPA request # 1433170-000 for FBI records concerning 065-HQ-57411. We are reaching out to you to determine if you are still interested in these records, or, if at this time, you would consider reducing the size of your request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis. Requests are divided into two primary tracks -simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents). Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-500 pages), large (501-4,999 pages), and extra-large (5,000 and over pages) sub-tracks are based upon request size.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the large track and reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us with regards to this inquiry to let us know if you are still interested in receiving records for this request either in full (the remaining records), or reducing the request to a faster processing track.\r\nIf you reduce the size, you may request remaining, additional records by submitting a new FOIPA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<http://www.fbi.gov/foia> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DA2456.D092CD00][Logo, company name  Description automatically generated]",

Martinez was on July 8, 1922. He died on January 30, 2021. \r\n\r\nSee \"Eugenion Martinez,\" WIkipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Mart%C3%ADnez.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events \r\n\r\nAs a career journalist and regular contributor to national news sites like Just Security, Counterpunch, and The Intercept,  I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the CIA and FBI and its activities for the Washington Post, Slate, Salon, the New Republic, and the Nation, so I have a reasonable expectation of publication.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the released files available to the public. I therefore request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJeff Morley\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Martinez was on July\r\n    8, 1922.

I have previously written about\r\n    the CIA and FBI and its activities for the Washington Post, Slate, Salon,\r\n    the New Republic, and the Nation, so I have a reasonable expectation of\r\n    publication.\r\n    \r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the\r\n    request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7\r\n    552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).

A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u2018Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u2019 link. Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks-simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into small, medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track extra-small requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days, medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,370 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the [complex] request [large] processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is [September, 2026].  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please indicate so and a representative will be in contact.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process? Visit us at http://www.fbi.gov/foia\r\n\r\nPlease check the status of your request online at https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps    Status updates are performed on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nNote:  This is a non-emergency email address.  If this is an emergency, please call 911 directly.  If you need to report a tip for immediate action, please contact FBI Tips at http://tips.fbi.gov/ or reach out to your local field office.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a public records request made via MuckRock under the Hawaii Uniform Information Practices Act, seeking records related to employment rosters in this state.\r\n\r\nThis request is brought by Big Local News along with a collaboration of news organizations, including ABC News, KQED, MuckRock, the Invisible Institute and other news organizations. Big Local News is a program of Stanford University\u2019s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and helps journalists collect, process and analyze public data. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking any datasets, databases, and/or spreadsheets sufficient to show the following information regarding every current or former employee of the Hawaii AG's Office, Hawaii Department of Taxation, Hawaii Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement, Hawaii Department of Transportation, and Hawaii Department of Public Safety, year-by-year, dating back however far as the electronic data exist for:\r\n\r\nFirst name\r\nMiddle name or initial\r\nLast name\r\nUnique employee identification number\r\nRace\r\nGender\r\nYear of birth\r\nEmploying agency\r\nJob title\r\nDivision assignment\r\nHire date\r\nSeparation date, if applicable\r\nReason for separation, if applicable\r\n\r\nIf your roster system contains data elements not listed above, please include them in the response, provided they are releasable under the law. On the other hand, we recognize some of the information we are asking for may not be tracked by your system. If that is the case, we are willing to accept as many of the data elements as your agency maintains. If some records are more readily available, we are happy to receive partial information as soon as possible while the remaining request is processed. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the data elements listed, we request documentation necessary to understand and interpret the data, including but not limited to record layouts, data dictionaries, code sheets, lookup tables, etc. \r\n\r\nOur preference is to receive structured data provided in a machine-readable text file, such as delimited or fixed-width formats. We can also handle a variety of other data formats including SQL databases, Excel workbooks and MS Access. If there are additional formats your agency would prefer to provide, please let us know. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking this information as a news media organization on a matter of public interest concerning the conduct of government. As such, we ask for a waiver of all fees, if allowed under state law. If fees are necessary to reimburse the agency for actual costs, we agree to pay up to $100. If costs exceed that amount, please let us know before fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease send clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time. Thank you very much for your time and attention to this request.\r\n\r\nSam Stecklow\r\nJournalist\r\nInvisible Institute",

        "communication": "Dear Susan Dyer Reynolds,\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are following up on a records request that was sent from \u201cBelle Reve\u201d from the muckrock email address above.  The Office of the Mayor responded to this request on September 4 and September 18.  See attached file entitled \u201cRe_Sunshine Great Highway.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn our response of September 18, we provided five records responsive to the original request.  Two of those records contained redactions.  We set forth the bases of those redactions in the body of our response.  We understand that your Immediate Disclosure Request, sent Sunday and therefore deemed received today, seeks unredacted versions of those two records.\r\n\r\nThe redacted versions of those files are linked in the attached.  We cannot provide unredacted versions.  As we clearly explained in our September 18 email, \u201cthe record entitled \u201cRe_MEDIA Alert \u2026\u201d has been redacted to protect personal contact information.  See California Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 1; Cal. Gov. Code 7927.700.\u201d  As shown in that file, we redacted the personal email contact information of a member of the public to protect their privacy.  Those redactions were identified, along with the statutory citations to justify them, in the body of our September 18 email.\r\n\r\nWe also clearly explained that \u201c[t]he record entitled \u201cRE_Draft Great Highway \u2026\u201d has been redacted pursuant to the attorney/client privilege.  See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 7927.705; Cal. Evid. Code \u00a7 954; S.F. Admin. Code \u00a7 67.21(k).\u201d  All of the redactions in that file were made because all of the redacted portions are communications made for purposes of soliciting or receiving legal advice and are therefore protected from disclosure pursuant to the attorney/client privilege.  The statutory citations to justify these redactions are also clearly provided in the body of our September 18 email.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Mayor\u2019s Office satisfied our obligations under SFSO 67.27 by clearly identifying and justifying the redactions in these files with citations to specific statutory authority.  We also provided a clear reference to the justifications for the withholdings in each document, as we provided statements for each document explaining the redactions in those documents, as required by SFSO 67.26.  We also kept withholding to a minimum; only the portions of the \u201cRe_MEDIA Alert\u201d document with personal contact information and the portions of the \u201cRe_Draft Great Highway\u201d document containing attorney/client privileged communications were withheld.  See SFSO 67.26.  No additional redactions were made.\r\n\r\nThus, we have provided you with responsive records and properly justified the redactions in those records.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have located additional records responsive to your request.  See them attached here.  Note that the record entitled \u201c00. Notes -  Great Highway Parade 6.29.24_Redacted\u201d contains redactions of certain phone numbers which have been withheld to protect personal privacy and because they constitute official information subject to the official information privilege.  See California Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 1; Cal. Gov. Code 7927.700; Cal. Evid. Code 1040.\r\n\r\nWe have not withheld any records in their entirety in response to your request.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nHank Heckel\r\nLegal Compliance Officer\r\nOffice of the Mayor\r\nCity and County of San Francisco",

However, such requests are reserved for requests that are \u201csimple, routine and readily answerable.\u201d See San Francisco Administrative Code Section 67.25(a).  Your request seeks communications between anyone in the Mayor\u2019s Office and five different individuals with no subject matter limitation over an unlimited period of time.  Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for an immediate disclosure request and is being processed as a regular request.\r\n\r\nWe have invoked a 14 day extension from the original due date due to the need to consult with another City department.  See Cal. Gov. Code 7922.535(a) and S.F. Admin. Code \u00a7 67.25(b).  Therefore, we will further respond no later than October 18.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nHank Heckel\r\nLegal Compliance Officer\r\nOffice of the Mayor\r\nCity and County of San Francisco",

See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.38(a).  Your requests do not fulfill this requirement because \u200bthey do not indicate whether you are commercial, educational/non-commercial scientific, media or other type of requester \u200bas your interest in requested information will affect if any fees will be assessed.  We therefore are unable to process your four requests at this time.  If you wish to pursue your requests, please provide us with more information that will further explain your fee category.\r\n\r\n\u200bOnce the fee category is resolved, additional information\u200b is needed on  \u200bthe following requests:\r\nFor DOI-OS-2020-002552, \u200bthe scope is unclear and additional information is needed. FOIA requires that requests describe the records sought with sufficient detail to allow an agency employee familiar with the subject area of the request to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort.  Your request does not adequately describe the records sought.  Please provide more information, such who/which office you would like searched, where you would like us to search, etc.\r\n\r\nFor DOI-OS-2020-005832, there \u200bis no attachment, we are \u200bunable to identify the subject of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may contact our office by email at osfoia@ios.doi.gov,<mailto:osfoia@ios.doi.gov,> through FOIA Online, by phone at (202) 513-0765, by fax at (202) 219-2374, or by mail at U.S. Department of the Interior, 1849 C St, N.W., MS-7328 MIB, Washington, D.C. 20240.

I sent a zip file back in August but It doesn't seem to have gone through.  I am sending this message without the attachment so I know it will go through.  I will then send another message with the attachment and hopefully it works.  Please let me know if you don't get it and maybe there is another way to get it to you.  \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nLori Halbleib",
