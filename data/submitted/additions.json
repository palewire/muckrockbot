I work with Alisha Patel and Katie Stathulis at the Center for Public Interest Advocacy & Collaboration, an educational, research and advocacy organization at Northeastern University School of Law. \r\n\r\nIn June 2023, Rebecca LeBlanc, Acton Police Department Records Clerk, fulfilled Alisha\u2019s request for school-based arrest data, including referrals to law enforcement. The records we received are attached for reference. We request clarification of the definition of \u201creferral\u201d used by your police department, including the process for a referral and how it differs from an arrest. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNorrie Osgood\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law\r\nosgood.n@northeastern.edu \r\n(603) 848-2018",

This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request.\r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. PDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields. Outputting to .csv rather than .pdf will aid in transparency, and is appreciated. \r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email aside from the specified ones. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. The law states, Section 24-72-205 (5) (a), C.R.S., (a) A custodian may charge a fee not to exceed twenty-five cents per standard page for a copy of a public record or a fee not to exceed the actual cost of providing a copy, printout, or photograph of a public record in a format other than a standard page; except that a custodian shall not charge a per-page fee for providing records in a digital or electronic format. \r\n2. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff. Please provide a quantitative list of the time involved and the staff who performed the tasks.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
