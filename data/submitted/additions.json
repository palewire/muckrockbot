Case number: 2024CF000758 Charges: 1st-Degree Recklessly Endangering Safety, Vehicle Operator Flee/Elude Officer, Drive or Operate Vehicle w/o Consent, Resisting or Obstructing an Officer On May 15th 2024, 25-year-old Tyrone Patterson Jr. was apprehended after leading law enforcement on a multi-jurisdictional chase. The pursuit originated from an armed carjacking in Chicago, where Patterson allegedly stole a Toyota Camry. Chicago police tracked the vehicle via helicopter as it crossed into Wisconsin. Upon entering Kenosha County, deputies deployed stop sticks; Patterson continued to evade, eventually abandoning the vehicle and fleeing on foot before being arrested. He faces multiple felony charges, including fleeing and recklessly endangering safety, and is currently held on a bond exceeding $50,000. Please let me know of any costs associated with this request, thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
