        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis request concerns actions taken on May 1, 2025, in Irvine, California, as referenced in these articles: (a) https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-home-suspect-accused-doxing-ice-agents-raided-searched; and (b) https://abc7.com/post/ice-agents-storm-michael-changs-parents-irvine-home-search-answers-posters-placed-around-la/16298909. These actions concern the search warrant executed on May 1, 2025, in or near Irvine, California (the \"Search Warrant\") and the fliers depicting the names, photos, phone numbers, and/or locations of ICE officers (the \"ICE Fliers\"). An example of the ICE Fliers can be found at https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/1440/810/socal-flyers-exposing-personal-information-of-ice-agents.png?ve=1&tl=1. \r\n\r\nI request:\r\n\r\n(1) Any Communications sent to or from your press, media, or public relations personnel relating to (a) the Search Warrant or (b) the ICE Fliers. This request is limited to records generated on or after January 20, 2025.\r\n\r\n(2) Any Communications sent or received by Tricia McLaughlin concerning (a) the Search Warrant or (b) the ICE Fliers.\r\n\r\n(3) Any Communications sent or received by Todd Lyons concerning (a) the Search Warrant or (b) the ICE Fliers.\r\n\r\n(4) Any Communications between your press, media, or public relations personnel, on the one hand, and Bill Melugin, on the other hand, on or after January 20, 2025.\r\n\r\n(5) A copy of any video or photographs shared with any journalist or media outlet (a) depicting the ICE Fliers or (b) taken in connection with preparations for or execution of the Search Warrant.\r\n\r\n(6) A copy of any ICE Fliers (or any photographs of ICE Fliers) that were the subject of the Search Warrant.\r\n\r\n(7) All after-action reports or incident reports summarizing the execution of the Search Warrant.\r\n\r\n(8) A copy of the Search Warrant.\r\n\r\n(9) A copy of any application for the Search Warrant.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(ii) and (iv) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\nI have previously been granted expedited processing by federal agencies, including the Department of Defense.\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the agency's involvement in the execution of a search warrant.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the articles identified above, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic. Additionally, the federal government has established that there is a public interest in the execution of this search warrant because it invited a journalist to cover its execution, as reflected by a tweet posted by FOX News journalist Bill Melugin (https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1918036686631739469). \r\n\r\n4. The records concern a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence. The records relate to a search warrant reportedly predicated on a political activist's publication of information identifying law enforcement officers. That conduct implicates the First Amendment's broad protection for the publication of information concerning government officials and conduct. The federal government recognizes that there is widespread and exceptional media interest in the underlying subject matter because it invited at least one journalist from a national media outlet to cover the execution of the search warrant. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by law enforcement personnel.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the government's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by law enforcement personnel.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the government's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

If DOE or ORNL intends to withhold any responsive material, please provide an index of the withheld documents as required by Vaughn v. Rosen.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
