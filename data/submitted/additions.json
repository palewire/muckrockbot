        "communication": "Dear U.S. Navy:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. \r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nI am seeking records related to the Navy and Marine Corps energy conservation mascot, a light bulb named Brite. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, development, creation, and design of the Brite mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to the military's decision to create an energy conservation mascot in the first place. \r\n\r\nNote: According to the attached records, Brite was developed by members of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Northwest, Public Works Department in Kitsap, Washington. So please be sure to search there.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Brite-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, photographs, videos, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any life-size Brite costume (pictured in the attached records). Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Brite.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all correspondence related to Brite (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. U.S. Senator Jodi Ernst (R-IA) may have sent some responsive records. \r\n\r\n6. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision by the Navy or Marine Corps to stop using Brite as part of its public outreach.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",
