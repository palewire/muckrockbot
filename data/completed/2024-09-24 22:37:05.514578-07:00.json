        "communication": "The normalization of surveillance and the erosion of data privacy is on the rise in communities across Illinois. This surveillance capitalism is the commodification of personal data by the hands of elected officials and city governments. Often, these technologies are implemented without the fully informed consent of the public, who are being subject to 24/7 warrantless surveillance. Given this concerning trend, we are requesting documents that shed light on the City of Evanston\u2019s involvement with Placer.ai.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, we hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tContracts and Agreements: Copies of any contracts, agreements, order forms, or memoranda of understanding (MOUs) between the City of Evanston and Placer.ai, including any associated service-level agreements, terms of use, or scopes of work.\r\n\t2.\tData Usage Reports: Any reports, summaries, presentations, or internal documentation that detail how the City of Evanston is utilizing data or analytics from Placer.ai, including any findings or conclusions drawn from the data.\r\n\t3.\tPrivacy Policies and Guidelines: Any policies, guidelines, or internal communications concerning data privacy and protection related to the City of Evanston\u2019s use of Placer.ai. This should include how data from Placer.ai is collected, stored, used, or shared, as well as any privacy impact assessments conducted.\r\n\t4.\tFunding Information: Records detailing the funding sources for the City of Evanston\u2019s engagement with Placer.ai, including any external funding such as grants or private partnerships that contributed to the adoption of this service.\r\n\t5.\tPublic Notices and Engagement: Copies of any public notices, press releases, or communications that informed business owners and/or community members about the use of Placer.ai, as well as any documents outlining efforts to engage the public or seek community input on this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, we would be grateful if you would inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling our request.

        "communication": "Dear Susan Dyer Reynolds,\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are following up on a records request that was sent from \u201cBelle Reve\u201d from the muckrock email address above.  The Office of the Mayor responded to this request on September 4 and September 18.  See attached file entitled \u201cRe_Sunshine Great Highway.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn our response of September 18, we provided five records responsive to the original request.  Two of those records contained redactions.  We set forth the bases of those redactions in the body of our response.  We understand that your Immediate Disclosure Request, sent Sunday and therefore deemed received today, seeks unredacted versions of those two records.\r\n\r\nThe redacted versions of those files are linked in the attached.  We cannot provide unredacted versions.  As we clearly explained in our September 18 email, \u201cthe record entitled \u201cRe_MEDIA Alert \u2026\u201d has been redacted to protect personal contact information.  See California Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 1; Cal. Gov. Code 7927.700.\u201d  As shown in that file, we redacted the personal email contact information of a member of the public to protect their privacy.  Those redactions were identified, along with the statutory citations to justify them, in the body of our September 18 email.\r\n\r\nWe also clearly explained that \u201c[t]he record entitled \u201cRE_Draft Great Highway \u2026\u201d has been redacted pursuant to the attorney/client privilege.  See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 7927.705; Cal. Evid. Code \u00a7 954; S.F. Admin. Code \u00a7 67.21(k).\u201d  All of the redactions in that file were made because all of the redacted portions are communications made for purposes of soliciting or receiving legal advice and are therefore protected from disclosure pursuant to the attorney/client privilege.  The statutory citations to justify these redactions are also clearly provided in the body of our September 18 email.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Mayor\u2019s Office satisfied our obligations under SFSO 67.27 by clearly identifying and justifying the redactions in these files with citations to specific statutory authority.  We also provided a clear reference to the justifications for the withholdings in each document, as we provided statements for each document explaining the redactions in those documents, as required by SFSO 67.26.  We also kept withholding to a minimum; only the portions of the \u201cRe_MEDIA Alert\u201d document with personal contact information and the portions of the \u201cRe_Draft Great Highway\u201d document containing attorney/client privileged communications were withheld.  See SFSO 67.26.  No additional redactions were made.\r\n\r\nThus, we have provided you with responsive records and properly justified the redactions in those records.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have located additional records responsive to your request.  See them attached here.  Note that the record entitled \u201c00. Notes -  Great Highway Parade 6.29.24_Redacted\u201d contains redactions of certain phone numbers which have been withheld to protect personal privacy and because they constitute official information subject to the official information privilege.  See California Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 1; Cal. Gov. Code 7927.700; Cal. Evid. Code 1040.\r\n\r\nWe have not withheld any records in their entirety in response to your request.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nHank Heckel\r\nLegal Compliance Officer\r\nOffice of the Mayor\r\nCity and County of San Francisco",

As part of the transition, new tracking numbers were generated for many open FOIA requests. As you have five or more open FOIA requests, please find attached a chart with your requests pending in the Office of the Secretary\u2019s FOIA Unit, including each request\u2019s original and corresponding FOIAonline request numbers. We hope you find this helpful in any future correspondence with the Office of the Secretary\u2019s FOIA Unit.\r\n\r\nIf, upon review, you are no longer interested in any of these requests, we would be happy to assist you in closing them in FOIAonline or you can withdraw them directly in FOIAonline. Please note that unless and until you contact the Office of the Secretary\u2019s FOIA Unit and ask for a particular request or requests to be withdrawn, we will continue processing all of these requests.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out with any questions.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nLeah Fairman\n--\r\nDepartment of the Interior\r\nOffice of the Secretary, FOIA Office\r\n1849 C Street, NW, MS-7328\r\nWashington, D.C. 20240\r\nos_foia@ios.doi.gov\r\n(202) 513-0765 - phone\r\n(202) 219-2374 - fax",

I certify under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the foregoing statements are true and correct. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The referral was received by JMD FOIA on 12/31/2020 and assigned the JMD tracking number identified above.  For your records, the Executive Office for Immigration Review identifying tracking number was FOIA-2021-07534 .  The Justice Management Division assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited. Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track. Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month whereas complex requests necessarily take longer. At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track. Please note that as a general matter, records in the Department are decentralized and our response will only cover information originating with or relating to JMD. If you are seeking information originating with or relating to other components of the Department, please make a FOIA request directly to those components.  If you have a question about the status of your FOIA request, you may contact this office by sending an email to JMDfoia@usdoj.gov or by calling 202-514-3101 during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Eastern Time, excluding federal holidays.)

Cassidy, Stuart V. Couch, Earle B. Wilson, and Keith E. Hunsucker  Assigned JMD FOIA TRACKING NUMBER: 131630  Dear Mr. Andrew Free:  This is to acknowledge that while processing your Freedom of Information Act request dated 9/16/2019 concerning the subject above, the Executive Office for Immigration Review referred matters that are of primary interest to the Justice Management Division (JMD) for processing and direct response to you. The referral was received by JMD FOIA on 8/7/2023 and assigned the JMD tracking number identified above.  For your records, the Executive Office for Immigration Review identifying tracking number was 2023-15398.  The Justice Management Division assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited. Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track. Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month whereas complex requests necessarily take longer. At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track.  Please note that as a general matter, records in the Department are decentralized and our response will only cover information originating with or relating to JMD. If you are seeking information originating with or relating to other components of the Department of Justice, please make a FOIA request directly to those components.  If you have a question about the status of your FOIA request, you may contact this office by sending an email to JMDfoia@usdoj.gov or by calling 202-616-0253 during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 9AM to 5PM EST, excluding federal holidays.)

For your information, the OIG is\r\nan independent unit of the National Archives and Records Administration\r\n(NARA) tasked by Congress to combat fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement\r\nwithin NARA.  As such, we have no control or authority over records kept\r\nand maintained by any other government agency, or even any office at NARA.\r\nWe only control those records generated within the OIG alone.  Accordingly,\r\nno other office at NARA controls OIG records.\r\n\r\nIn my initial response to you on June 20, 2019, I stated I found three\r\ntypes of records potentially related to your request.  First were things\r\nsuch as newsletters and emails sent to groups, which had various public\r\nnews stories summarized or listed which were publically available and not\r\nrelated to any agency actions.  These were considered unresponsive.\r\nSecond, several records belonging to NARA as an agency that were\r\npotentially responsive were referred over to the NGC FOIA office to review\r\nand potentially include in their response.  Finally, the OIG Office of\r\nInvestigations had some potentially responsive records, which were sent to\r\nthe FOIA office of another agency which had equities in them for a\r\nconsult.  This response covers these last records, and completes our\r\nresponse on this FOIA request.\r\n\r\nYour request and the potentially responsive records were sent to the\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and were assigned FBI FOI/PA Request\r\n# 1438678-000.  The redactions made by the FBI show on the attached\r\ndocument as white blocks with a black outline and the reasons for the FBI\u2019s\r\nredactions are labeled by each block.  In addition to these redactions, the\r\nNARA OIG also made additional redactions, which show as solid black boxes.\r\nThese are labeled with the reason as well.  These additional redactions\r\nwere made under FOIA Exemptions b(6) and b(7)(C) due to the privacy\r\ninterests of the other parties involved.  Redactions pursuant to Exemptions\r\nb(6) and b(7)(C) included information that constituted a clearly\r\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or records compiled for law\r\nenforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an\r\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  Information compiled for law\r\nenforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to interfere with\r\nenforcement proceedings is redacted pursuant to Exemption b(7)(A).   Law\r\nenforcement information which could reasonably be expected to disclose the\r\nidentity of a confidential source is redacted under Exemption b(7)(D).\r\nInformation that would disclose techniques and procedures for law\r\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions which could reasonably be\r\nexpected to risk circumvention of the law is redacted under Exemption\r\nb(7)(E).\r\n\r\nYou have the right to administratively appeal those determinations by\r\nwriting to the Archivist of the United States, National Archives and\r\nRecords Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD, 20740, within\r\nninety (90) calendar days of the date of this letter.  If you choose to\r\nappeal, your appeal letter and its envelope should be clearly marked\r\n\u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal,\u201d and you should explain why you believe\r\nNARA should release the withheld information.  Any appeal will be\r\ncoordinated with the Department of Justice Office of Information Policy\r\nregarding the FBI redactions.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss the NARA OIG redactions before filing an\r\nappeal to attempt to resolve your dispute without going through the appeals\r\nprocess, you may contact the OIG\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, James Springs, for\r\nassistance at:\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\nOffice of Inspector General\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 1300\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n (301) 837-3018\r\njames.springs@nara.gov\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may seek dispute resolution services on the FBI\r\nredactions by contacting the FBI\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison by emailing\r\nfoipaquestions@fbi.gov.  If you submit your dispute resolution\r\ncorrespondence with the FBI by email, the subject heading should clearly\r\nstate \u201cDispute Resolution Services.\u201d  Please also cite the FBI FOIPA\r\nRequest Number assigned to your request (#1438678-000) so it may be easily\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to resolve your FOIA dispute through the FOIA Public\r\nLiaisons, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), the Federal\r\nFOIA Ombudsman\u2019s office, offers mediation services to help resolve disputes\r\nbetween FOIA requesters and Federal agencies. The contact information for\r\nOGIS is:\r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road\u2013OGIS\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\nogis@nara.gov\r\nogis.archives.gov\r\n202-741-5770 or 1-877-684-6448\r\n\r\nFinally, in accordance with Department of Justice guidance, I would also\r\nlike to notify you that Congress excluded three discrete categories of law\r\nenforcement and national security records from the requirements of the\r\nFOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c) (2006 & Supp. IV 2010).  This response is limited\r\nto those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is\r\na standard notification given to all our requesters and should not be taken\r\nas an indication excluded records do, or do not, exist.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact me directly at\r\n301-837-1966 or john.simms@nara.gov.  Thank you for contacting the NARA\r\nOIG.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nJohn Simms\r\nCounsel to the Inspector General\r\nOffice of Inspector General\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n301-837-1966\r\n\r\nTHE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS TRANSMITTAL MAY BE CONFIDENTIAL AND MAY\r\nBE PROTECTED FROM DISCLOSURE UNDER ATTORNEY-CLIENT AND/OR ATTORNEY\r\nWORK-PRODUCT PRIVILEGES.

Could you provide a date range for your request? 2. When you say \"...acquisition and installation...\", do you mean operational emails only (internal), or do you also want us to include emails from the public? I performed a global email search using the following terms [Mosquito device, mosquito noise, sonic device, sonic devices, sonic deterrent, crossroads restroom, crossroads white paper, and mosquito] and the search returned about 7000 emails. Depending how \"acquisition and installation\" is interpreted will affect how much email is turned over to you. \r\nOnce we receive your response we will be able to provide an estimated date of release. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nHaley Havens Bellevue Public Records \r\n425-452-4283",

I respectfully request a review of this determination, as under the New York State Archives' ED-1 schedule, expense records such as those requested are required to be retained for at least six years following the end of the fiscal year in which they were created. Therefore, records from the 2017-2018 period should be available until at least end of 2024.\r\n\r\nGiven that these records fall within the retention period mandated by New York State guidelines, and considering the significance of transparency and accountability within public offices, I believe that these records should exist unless there is documented evidence of their lawful disposal according to the stated retention schedule.\r\n\r\nI request that the district review its records once more to ensure that no relevant documents have been overlooked and to provide a detailed explanation or documentation if it is concluded that the records have indeed been destroyed or are otherwise unavailable. Such transparency is crucial for public trust and the proper oversight of public resources.\r\n\r\nPlease advise me in writing of your decision regarding this appeal within ten business days as stipulated by Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(4)(a). Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMary Lee",

Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012) affirms the public\u2019s right to record public officials in public settings, which supports the disclosure of body camera footage.\r\n\r\nRadio Transmissions: All audio recordings and transcripts of radio communications involving law enforcement personnel during the protest. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978) indicates the public interest in accessing law enforcement communications for transparency.\r\n\r\nText Communications: All SMS and instant messages sent to and from officers concerning the enforcement activities at the protest. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998) supports the release of communications to ensure transparency in governmental operations.\r\n\r\nAerial Footage: All video recordings from helicopters, drones, or any other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used during the protest. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Electronic Frontier Foundation v. Department of Transportation, 2015 (finding that aerial surveillance footage is subject to disclosure under FOIA to allow public analysis of governmental surveillance practices).\r\n\r\nPhysical Documents:\r\n\r\nIncident Reports and Briefings: All written reports, memos, and briefing documents pertaining to the law enforcement activities during the protest. \r\n\r\nLegal support: Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989) supports the disclosure of law enforcement records for public scrutiny.\r\n\r\nOperational Plans: Documents detailing the strategies and guidelines used for managing the protest. \r\n\r\nLegal support: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978) demonstrates the public's right to understand the strategic operations of public authorities.\r\n\r\nLegal Precedents and Public Interest Justification:\r\n\r\nThe requested information is of significant public interest, particularly concerning government operations at public protests and the specific enforcement tactics employed. The release of these records will enhance public understanding and facilitate informed community oversight.\r\n\r\nFees and Document Delivery:\r\n\r\nPlease inform me of any potential fees associated with the processing of this request. I request a waiver of all fees as this disclosure is primarily in the public interest, contributing substantially to the understanding of government operations and is not for commercial purposes. I prefer to receive the documents electronically, via email or on a CD-ROM if electronic transfer is impractical.\r\n\r\nResponse Time and Contact:\r\n\r\nI anticipate your response within the statutory timeframe prescribed by law. Should you require any clarification or have questions regarding this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the provided phone number or email address.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention and cooperation. I look forward to your prompt and thorough handling of this request, as dictated by applicable laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

\n\n--- Please respond above this line --- \nDear , Thank you again for contacting the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. With regard to your public records request Ref. #P761237-051024, you substantially sought the following records: \"I am requesting records pertaining to the law enforcement activities by the Florida Highway Patrol during the public protest on May 1, 2024, part of the Free Palestine and Resistance Movement against Israeli aggression. \n\nRequested Records: \nDigital Documents: \n1. Body Camera Footage: Complete recordings from body-worn cameras of all officers involved from the start to the end of their deployment at the protest. \nLegal support: ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012) affirms the public\u2019s right to record public officials in public settings, which supports the disclosure of body camera footage. \n2. Radio Transmissions: All audio recordings and transcripts of radio communications involving law enforcement personnel during the protest. \nLegal support: Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978) indicates the public interest in accessing law enforcement communications for transparency. \n3. Text Communications: All SMS and instant messages sent to and from officers concerning the enforcement activities at the protest. \nLegal support: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998) supports the release of communications to ensure transparency in governmental operations. \n4. Aerial Footage: All video recordings from helicopters, drones, or any other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used during the protest. \nLegal support: Electronic Frontier Foundation v. Department of Transportation, 2015 (finding that aerial surveillance footage is subject to disclosure under FOIA to allow public analysis of governmental surveillance practices). \nPhysical Documents: \n5. Incident Reports and Briefings: All written reports, memos, and briefing documents pertaining to the law enforcement activities during the protest. \nLegal support: Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989) supports the disclosure of law enforcement records for public scrutiny. \n6. Operational Plans: Documents detailing the strategies and guidelines used for managing the protest. \nLegal support: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978) demonstrates the public's right to understand the strategic operations of public authorities. \nLegal Precedents and Public Interest Justification:.\" Payment received, flash drive was mailed out on September 20, 2024. Copy of receipt attached. \nIncluded with this message are download link(s) to the records you requested; those links remain active for 30 days. Accordingly, public records request Ref. #\u00a0P761237-051024 is CLOSED. \nRespectfully yours, \nLorigay Laskin \nFHP Troop C (Tampa Station) \nDEPARTMENT OF HIGHWAY SAFETY AND MOTOR VEHICLES\n",

As you say, \"Allegheny County Sheriff\u2019s Office utilizes a large array of policies that guide its operations...\" These are the policies which are being sought\u2014those which guide police operations. For example, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police publishes a \"manual of procedural orders\", which presumably does not contain information that would be excepted from disclosure under right-to-know law. https://pittsburghpa.gov/police/manual-procedural-orders\r\n\r\n2. The intention of requesting records from the Allegheny County Sheriff's Office was to obtain records in custody the Allegheny County Sheriff's Office, and not from other agencies. I will be sure to adjust the language of future requests.\r\n\r\n3. Certainly, I do not wish to endanger the Office's computer security or ongoing investigations. I believe the Office is well within its rights to redact or omit records which are excepted from disclosure. Please proceed with the request by supplying those policies which are not excepted.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJosh Chamberlain",

        "communication": "Good morning Mrs. Haskins,\r\n\r\nPrior to processing your request, could you re-look at the search parameters you have provided?  Region 3 includes New Mexico and Arizona, so while we can search for records related to the Sawmill Fire, we will not have records related to the Paradise Fire which occurred recently in CA.   For expediency, could you please let us know which offices you would like to have search for records?  Are you requesting that we have all the employees in Region 3 conduct an email search?  Limit the search to employees involved in the investigation and/or those who work in the Coronado National Forest that were affected by the fire?  Are you wanting records related to FS efforts in fighting the fire?  Are you interested in the records related to the numerous FOIA requests for the video?  The more specific you are in describing exactly which records you are interested in, and which offices you want to conduct the search, the faster and more accurately we will be able to provide the documents you are requesting.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA specifies two requirements for a request for records to be considered a valid, \u201cperfected\u201d request:  (1) It must \u201creasonably describe\u201d the records requested and (2) it must be made in accordance with the agency\u2019s published FOIA regulations.  After careful review of your FOIA request, the Forest Service has determined that your request does not specifically identify the records which you are seeking.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  See 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.5(b), and Forest Service Handbook 6209.13.  Where possible, a requester should supply specific information regarding dates, titles, names of individuals, names of offices, and name of agencies or organizations that may help identify the records.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.\r\n\r\nIn the event that we do not hear from you within 20 business days from the date of this email, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns related to the processing you\u2019re your request, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAlisha\n",

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Haskin,\r\n\r\nA quick update on your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  In your email below, you indicated that your request was submitted in November 2018, however according to our records, your request (2024-APHIS-03699-F) was dated and received in our office (USDA/APHIS) on January 31, 2024. This request seeks information on Neuralink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Your 2018 email threads below indicate that you filed a request with U.S. Forest Service regarding documents related to the Sawmill Fire in Arizona sparked by a gender-reveal party involving use of explosives on federal land. U.S Forest Service is a different agency than USDA/APHIS therefore you will need to follow up with US Forest Service regarding documents related to the Sawmill Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  If the USDA/APHIS was involved with a federal response to the Sawmill Fire, it is not related to the current FOIA Request (2024-APHIS-03699-F).  Please follow up with the correct analyst who may have a related FOIA Request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Lastly, your request (2024-APHIS-03699-F) was transferred to a new analyst, Shane Stonesifer. He can be contacted at shane.stonesifer@usda.gov<mailto:shane.stonesifer@usda.gov>. Going forward, please direct any future inquiries on this request to analyst Stonesifer.\nRegards,\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DAFDE1.88A75EB0]\r\nMaria E.

The project is a project of Collier Enterprises, and it is applying for a 404 permit form the state of Florida, per the Army Corpss delegation of 404 permitting authority to the state. The terms of that programmatic consultation that allowed the state of Florida to assume 404 authority required that FWS to conduct technical reviews and assistance to projects seeking 404 permits in order to ensure that they are in compliance with ESA Section 7. I wish to obtain records from FWS concerning its technical review and assistance as it relates to the Bellmar project. The Vero Beach office is likely the FWS office leading this review, along side FWS's Florida leadership team. Key FWS officials whose records to search for include Florida state leadership like Larry Williams and Robert Carey, as well as Jose Rivera at the Vero Beach Office.  \r\n\r\nThis request seeks records produced since January 1, 2023. \r\n\r\nI am a reporter for The Florida Center for Government Accountability and other outlets.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJimmy Tobias",

Her death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy\r\n    concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under\r\n    the Privacy Act. For example, you may find her New York Times obituary at\r\n    the following link:\r\n    https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/us/politics/beverly-lahaye-dead.html\r\n    \r\n    Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not\r\n    limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone\r\n    Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and\r\n    the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and\r\n    cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant\r\n    names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not\r\n    limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a\r\n    cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any\r\n    information provided by the SPLC.

Proof of death is not required as his death was widely reported: https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/28/us/prentice-marshall-77-federal-judge-dies.html. Marshall was one of the judges hearing cases related to Operation Greylord.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find his New York Times obituary at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/politics/pete-mccloskey-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an associate editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

It is inappropriate for this agency to issue such a letter so quickly after receiving the request.
