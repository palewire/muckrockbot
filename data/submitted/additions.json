Obviously mine is not a common name though online on the website Linktin there is a \"Nathan Sestak\" in Ohio. That person doesn't have a \"c\" in their last name though.  When I called the ranger station in northern most Vermont the next day seeking further explanation I was told to \"file a freedom of information request\" twice by an officer attendant of that station.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNathan Sestack",
