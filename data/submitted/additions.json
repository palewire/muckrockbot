I request that these records be provided in a machine-readable format, such as an Excel spreadsheet or CSV file, wherever possible.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Official notices of banishment or barring orders.\r\n2. Internal documentation or correspondences related to these individuals and their prohibited status.\r\n3. Any lists, databases, or compilations that maintain records of these individuals.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).

Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll publicly releasable military and civilian records for Louis Jolyon West (October 6, 1924 \u2013 January 2, 1999). Mr. West's social security number was  395-16-2395. He served in the United States Air Force (USAF) between approximately 1948 and 1956, and worked as a civilian contractor at the 3700th USAF Hospital at the Lackland Air Force Base after that. Therefore, I am requesting the following information from Mr. West's Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) and his Official Personnel Folder (OPF). This information includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Name\r\n\r\n\u2022 Service Number\r\n\r\n\u2022 Certificate of Release/Discharge Papers, aka DD form 214\r\n\r\n\u2022 Dates of Service\r\n\r\n\u2022 Branch of Service\r\n\r\n\u2022 Final Duty Status\r\n\r\n\u2022 Final Rank\r\n\r\n\u2022 Salary\r\n\r\n\u2022 Assignments and Geographical Locations\r\n\r\n\u2022 Source of Commission\r\n\r\n\u2022 Military Education Level\r\n\r\n\u2022 Awards and decorations\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian positions\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian titles\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian salaries\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian grades\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian job locations\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the National Personnel Records Center has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nYou will find as an attachment a copy of Mr. West's obituary from the The New York Times, published on January 9, 1999.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Mr. West, per the attached obituary, was a figure of considerable public interest. He worked for the government, both during his time in the USAF and as a civilian contractor, during the Korean War, on research related to the alleged brainwashing of American prisoners-of-war, by Korean, Soviet, and Chinese officials. Mr. West's OMPF and OPF would help provide the public with a better understanding of military and civilian-guided research on this subject during the Korean War.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $250. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
