        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPersonnel and the complete disciplinary record of former Police Officer Aliea Persaud and all disciplinary records that identify P.O. Aliea Persaud as a subject. For specificity and to rule out duplicates, P.O. Aliea Persaud may be identified by Shield Number 13797.\r\n\r\nDivisions that may hold responsive records include Internal Affairs, Employment Management, and Department Advocate's Office; however, any record used to evaluate performance toward the subject's continued employment or promotion should be considered responsive.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Freedom of Information Law as amended by Chapter 96 of the Laws of New York of 2020, records that may be released include \"the complaints, allegations, and charges against an employee; the name of the employee complained of or charged; the transcript of any disciplinary trial or hearing, including any exhibits introduced at such trial or hearing; the disposition of any disciplinary proceeding; and the final written opinion or memorandum supporting the disposition and discipline imposed including the agency's complete factual findings and its analysis of the conduct and appropriate discipline of the covered employee.\"\r\n\r\nUnder precedent, Freedom of Information Law uses a \"balancing test\" method of weighing privacy interests favoring redaction/denial against the public interest in favor of disclosure. This matter is of clear public interest for the following reasons: P.O. Aliea Persaud has been publicly accused of engaging in an off-duty act of domestic violence in the County of Queens: https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/2-off-duty-nypd-officers-arrested-in-separate-domestic-violence-incidents/ar-AAZV7TS\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKim Smith",
