As an investigative journalist, I seek these records to ensure public transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tWritten Orders or Directives:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll written orders or directives issued regarding the banishment or barring of individuals from the State Capitol.\r\n\t\u2022\tLegal Support: Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), supports the necessity for transparency in government actions affecting individuals\u2019 rights, ensuring that exculpatory evidence is disclosed.\r\n\t2.\tInternal Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tAny internal memos, emails, or communications regarding specific instances of individuals being banned from the State Capitol, including the dates of these instances and the reasons for banishment, if recorded.\r\n\t\u2022\tLegal Support: Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), establishes the importance of transparency in government communications, particularly those affecting individuals\u2019 rights and public access to information.\r\n\t3.\tFormal Notifications:\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords pertaining to instances where individuals were formally notified of their banishment from the State Capitol.\r\n\t\u2022\tLegal Support: Mathews v.

The public interest in transparency and accountability outweighs any privacy concerns in this context. The New York Court of Appeals has affirmed that privacy exemptions should not be used to withhold records that inform the public about government operations (see Gould v. New York City Police Dept., 89 N.Y.2d 267 (1996)).\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Justification:\r\n\r\nThe requested information is of significant public interest, particularly concerning the transparency of government operations and the actions taken to bar individuals from public buildings. Disclosure of these records will promote public understanding and facilitate informed community oversight.\r\n\r\nFees and Document Delivery:\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees associated with the processing of this request, as the disclosure serves the public interest significantly and enhances the understanding of government operations without any commercial benefit. I prefer to receive the documents electronically, via email or on a CD-ROM if digital transmission is not feasible.\r\n\r\nResponse Time and Legal Compliance:\r\n\r\nAs per the New York Freedom of Information Law, I expect a response within the statutory timeframe. Failure to comply with this request may result in legal action to enforce the Act\u2019s provisions.
