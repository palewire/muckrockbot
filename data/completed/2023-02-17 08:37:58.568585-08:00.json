This includes, but is not limited to, documents, reports, multimedia, body-worn camera footage, arrest filings, and so on. It also includes all documents, notes, correspondence and memoranda evidencing sustained findings reports and investigations, and all communication and correspondence in whatever tangible medium between the officials, the victims and the overseeing agency. \r\n\r\nI am requesting digital copies of all responsive documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nHere, misconduct includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\nExcessive (unreasonable) force \u2013 beatings, manhandling of people in handcuffs, improper use of Tasers, injuries inflicted by police dogs, improper use of deadly force, and other police brutality or disregard for the safety of suspects. It also includes, but is not limited to: physical and verbal abuse, restraints happening unreasonably, coerced or forced confessions, and sexual abuse and assault. \r\n\r\nFalse arrests \u2013 pulling over, detention, questioning and searches conducted without any probable cause whatsoever, including cases of planted evidence, racial profiling and trumped-up charges of resisting arrest.\r\n\r\nAs of March 2022, public officials must release police disciplinary records in New Jersey when the public\u2019s interest in them outweighs an officer\u2019s confidentiality concerns, the state\u2019s top court ruled. \r\n\r\nThe law requires that you respond to and fulfill this request \"as promptly as possible.\"  If you expect a significant delay in responding to and fulfilling this request, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n \r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 415-769-8210 or ananyatiwarijournalism@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnanya Tiwari",

Please include any and all email correspondence that touches on the MOU arrangement in any way.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $100. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how public funds are being used to replace the Parks Department leadership with Police Department leadership and relay the information to include a cost analysis to the public by way of a news media report. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri Sunshine Law requires a response within three business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this time period, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBeth Flowers\n\n\n",

There are no documents responsive to item #2 on your request. The document named Transmittal Email.pdf is the transmittal email from Dr. Leitzel to Ms. Hebda submitting our report and the document named Higher Education Program and Activity Survey.pdf is the survey response for South Florida State College requested in the Office of the Governor Memo 23-021. Those two documents are responsive to item #3 in your request.

(e.g. were there multiple design concepts submitted? Was the design of the character contracted out? (If so, kindly produce the contract).\r\n\r\n(3) Were any Milkshake-related promotional items or tchotchkes created (e.g trading cards, coloring books)? If so, please produce them.\r\n\r\n(4) Were there any life-size Milkshake costumes created? If so, please produce records related to the design of the costume (contracts, sketches, etc.) and any guidelines regarding the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n(5) Did anyone in Congress ever object to AMS's use of a mascot? I understand that there have been periodic attempts by lawmakers (e.g. former Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn) to rein in agency spending on mascots. If so, please produce all records related to that.\r\n\r\n(6) What has the public's reaction been to the Milkshake mascot?\r\n\r\n(7) Is AMS still using Milkshake as part of its public outreach? If not, why not?\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Marritz,\r\n\r\nThis email confirms receipt of your attached FOIA request.  Your request was received in the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) FOIA Office on September 6, 2022 and assigned tracking number 2022-AMS-00193-F.  Please reference this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), AMS has 20 business days upon receipt of your request to make a determination.  In unusual circumstances, such as the need to search for and collect records from field offices, the need to examine a voluminous amount of records, or the need to consult with another agency, AMS can extend the 20-day time limit for processing a request.  AMS generally processes FOIA requests on a \"first-in/first-out\" basis; however, the actual processing time will depend upon the complexity of your request, including whether it involves sensitive or voluminous records, business submitter records, extensive searches, and/or multiple consultations both within and outside of the Agency.\r\n\r\nIn addition to your request for records, you asked that we waive all fees associated with processing your request.  As a requester, you bear the burden under the FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on our review of your request and the reasons stated, we have determined that your fee waiver request does sufficiently meet all of the criteria under the FOIA and the applicable regulations; therefore, your request for a fee waiver is approved.\r\n\r\nWe will comply with your request to the fullest extent permissible by law.  Any records not subject to an exemption will be forwarded to you promptly upon completion of AMS' search and review process.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the status of your request, please contact Kyla Niedermaier-Betts, Government Information Specialist, at (202) 961-5298 or by email at kyla.niedermaier-betts1@usda.gov<mailto:kyla.niedermaier-betts1@usda.gov>.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nHeather Higgs\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nFOIA Office\r\nAgricultural Marketing Service\r\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\r\nBozeman, Montana\r\nOffice/Cell:  (202) 641-8684\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information generated by the USDA solely for the intended recipients. Any unauthorized interception of this message or the use or disclosure of the information it contains may violate the law and subject the violator to civil or criminal penalties. If you believe you have received this message in error, please notify the sender and delete the email immediately.\n",

Please include the complete email exchange for each email, including any emails that are being replied to as well as any subsequent replies.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities. I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

Any and all documentation regarding the re-entry planning process for people discharged from civil commitment for substance use disorder, including:\r\n    a) Overdose education and naloxone distribution\r\n    b) Linkage to treatment in the community\r\n    c) Linkage to housing in the community\r\n    d) Insurance assistance\r\n    e) Any other support or health services \r\n\r\n6. External overdose data. Any and all documentation noting the number of overdose incidents of patients within 1 year of re-entry from civil commitment for substance use disorder/addiction in each year since 2015.\r\nBecause this request involves a matter of public concern and because it is made on behalf of a nonprofit organization, we ask that you waive any fees.

Consistent with Kansas Open Records Act, K.S.A. \u00a7 45-215 through 45-223, we have begun the process of determining if the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services possesses any public records responsive to your request, and we will provide you with one or more of the following as soon as possible:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Copies of the requested public records;\r\n  2.  A statement concerning our inability to locate any public records responsive to your request;\r\n  3.  A request for clarification concerning the types of records or information you seek;\r\n  4.  A statement that records responsive to your request exist and are closed by law with an explanation of the legal basis allowing the records to be closed; or\r\n  5.  An estimate of the fees for the actual cost of responding to your request and that must be prepaid before records are produced.\r\n\r\nIf the records can be provided with less than one hour of staff time and involve no more than 100 pages, there will be no charge.  If responsive public records exist but are voluminous, difficult to locate, or contain a mix of open and closed information, it is likely that prepaid fees will be required.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this process.  KDADS will contact you again as soon as possible regarding the status of your request.\n",

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

Abu Akleh's death was widely reported, and publicly acknowledged (https://twitter.com/USAmbIsrael/status/1524286802135339008) by US Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides. As such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. \r\n\r\nAbu Akleh's last name may also be spelled Abu Aqleh, Abu Aklah, Abu Aqlah, Abu Aqlah, Abu Aqla, or Abu Akla.\r\n\r\nFrom 1997 until her death, Abu Akleh worked as a correspondent for the news channel Al Jazeera in the Palestinian territories, and was widely-known for her coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abu Akleh was killed while reporting on an Israeli military raid in the Palestinian city of Jenin; her colleagues at Al Jazeera and other news outlets accused Israeli forces of shooting Abu Akleh, while some Israeli officials implied that she may have been killed by Palestinian militants.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an investigative journalist who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Intercept, the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
