Aragon, M.D. Dr. P.H \n Director and State Public Health Officer  California Department of Public Health Gavin Newsom, Governor \n \n \n \n \nThank you for contacting the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) to obtain public records. \nYour Public Records Act (PRA) request dated March 08, 2023, is being processed.\u00a0 Reference Number P017998-030823 has been assigned for tracking purposes.\u00a0 Please refer to this reference number for use when accessing the CDPH Public Records Center Portal to monitor the progress of your request. \nCDPH strives to answer all requests for public records in as timely a manner as possible.\u00a0 Under California law, CDPH must respond to your inquiry no later than ten calendar days from receipt of the request to notify you whether records will be disclosed.\u00a0 \u00a0Note that some records are exempted from disclosure.\u00a0 If the requested records are exempt, we will inform you in writing as to why. \nThe Public Records Act (see Govt. Code \u00a76250 et. seq.) provides that CDPH may extend the response period for up to 14 calendar days should it be necessary to search for records located at off-site facilities or if the request involves a voluminous amount of records.\u00a0 We will notify you within 10 days of receipt of your request if a 14-day extension is necessary.\u00a0 If fees are involved, CDPH will need to collect the fees before releasing the records.\u00a0 However, there is typically no fee for records released electronically through the Public Records Center Portal. \nThe 10- and 14-day response periods are to allow CDPH time to determine how long it will take to disclose the requested records.\u00a0 Depending on the number of records requested or other factors, a response may take longer.\u00a0 CDPH will do its best to provide documents on a rolling basis as they become available and to keep you informed as to the timing and type of records to be released. \nPlease visit the CDPH Public Records Center Portal\u00a0to monitor request progress, communicate with CDPH staff processing your request and to submit future requests.

Specifically, I am requesting the written explanation of the emergency situation and the reason why waiting for the full 72-hour notice period would be impractical or detrimental to the public interest. A list of meeting dates where 72 hour notice was waived is listed below.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Advisory Opinion 13126 states that public bodies are required to document the emergency situation and the need to hold a meeting or provide documents with less than 72 hours notice. Therefore, I am requesting copies of any such documentation, including any notes, memos, or other records related to the emergency situations and the decisions to hold a meeting with less than 72 hours notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a list of the meeting dates for which I am requesting written explanations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n08/21/17\r\n05/15/19\r\n05/23/18\r\n02/27/14\r\n06/17/17\r\n12/15/14\r\n08/03/17\r\n12/19/11\r\n09/21/15\r\n12/10/18\r\n05/19/14\r\n09/19/16\r\n12/18/17\r\n08/07/17\r\n05/21/18\r\n05/16/16\r\n02/16/17\r\n10/20/14\r\n07/24/17\r\n02/22/16\r\n07/25/17\r\n03/29/17\r\n11/20/17\r\n01/11/18\r\n09/15/14\r\n12/20/10\r\n07/25/16\r\n01/21/16\r\n09/19/11\r\n06/18/12\r\n12/16/13\r\n08/26/13\r\n01/05/17\r\n08/25/14\r\n03/18/19\r\n10/17/11\r\n04/13/17\r\n07/17/17\r\n09/18/17\r\n05/15/17\r\n03/21/16\r\n06/25/16\r\n09/16/13\r\n07/16/18\r\n04/09/14\r\n04/06/16\r\n03/20/17\r\n01/12/12\r\n05/21/12\r\n07/16/12\r\n02/16/12\r\n03/19/18\r\n04/24/17\r\n12/19/16\r\n11/17/14\r\n10/17/16\r\n07/20/15\r\n11/16/15\r\n11/21/16\r\n08/15/16\r\n04/11/18\r\n07/16/18\r\n08/24/15\r\n02/08/17\r\n07/10/14\r\n02/18/14\r\n06/05/14\r\n10/21/13\r\n03/28/17\r\n01/12/17\r\n05/30/18\r\n03/17/14\r\n02/15/18\r\n06/20/16\r\n11/18/13\r\n01/23/14\r\n06/18/18\r\n06/19/17\r\n10/15/15\r\n07/10/17\r\n10/16/17\r\n09/17/18\r\n10/15/18\r\n08/20/18\r\n11/15/18\r\n01/17/19\r\n02/14/19\r\n05/16/19\r\n06/17/19\r\n07/15/19\r\n08/19/19\r\n09/16/19\r\n10/21/19\r\n11/25/19\r\n12/16/20\r\n02/13/20\r\n03/16/20\r\n04/20/20\r\n05/18/20\r\n06/15/20\r\n07/20/20\r\n08/17/20\r\n09/21/20\r\n10/19/20\r\n11/02/20\r\n11/16/20\r\n12/17/20\r\n01/14/21\r\n02/11/21\r\n03/15/21\r\n12/17/15\r\n07/15/13\r\n04/29/21\r\n05/16/22\r\n05/17/21\r\n06/21/21\r\n07/19/21\r\n08/09/21\r\n09/20/21\r\n10/18/21\r\n11/15/21\r\n12/20/21\r\n01/13/22\r\n02/17/22\r\n03/21/11\r\n04/13/22\r\n06/16/22\r\n07/14/22\r\n08/15/22\r\n09/12/22\r\n10/13/22\r\n11/14/22\r\n12/19/22\r\n01/12/23\r\n02/16/23\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nNew York State Open Meetings Law, specifically section 104(4)(b) which states that \"In the event of an emergency requiring immediate action, a public body may conduct a meeting without notice as long as it publicly states the reason or reasons why such meeting was not practicable to notice as provided in subdivision one of this section.\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the New York State Committee on Open Government has issued several advisory opinions that emphasize the importance of documenting the emergency situation and the need for the meeting. For example, Advisory Opinion 13126 states that \"In order to establish that there was an emergency that warranted dispensing with the 72-hour notice requirement, a written explanation of the emergency should be prepared.\"\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",
