I request any and all documents pertaining to DoD involvement with the production of \"The Forge.\" Such documents may include but should not be limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of DoD and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"The Forge,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nAttached is a list, released to me through FOIA by Dod, of TV and movie productions supported by DoD in 2023; \"The Forge\" is included on that list.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",
