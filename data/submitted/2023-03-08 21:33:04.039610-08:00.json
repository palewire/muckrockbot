        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords maintained or received by the DHS Chief FOIA Officer\u2019s office regarding that office\u2019s failure to meet the March 1, 2023, deadline for posting the statutorily mandated Chief FOIA Officer Annual Report in 2023. \r\n\r\nDescription of Records Sought - 6 C.F.R. 5.3(b) \r\nPlease task the search with the following parameters: \r\n\r\nRecords Systems to Search: (1) Emails (2) Calendar Entries \r\nTime period: February 1, 2023 - March 8, 2023. \r\nCustodians: DHS Chief FOIA Officer & any subordinate officials or contractors responsible for complying with FOIA\u2019s annual reporting requirements. \r\nSearch Terms: \u201cChief FOIA Officer Annual Report!\u201d \u201cMarch 1\u201d \u201c5 USC 552(e)!\u201d and \u201cFOIA /s Annual Report!\u201d \r\n(Note: the \u201c!\u201d Indicates responsive records would include all forms of the word attached to the !; Note: /s means \u201cwithin the same sentence as\u201d or \u201cwithin 50 words of\u201d)\r\n\r\nBackground \r\nWe make this request pursuant to the statutory authority at 5 USC 552(a)(3), and also as end-users of the statutorily mandated government records DHS has failed to timely release. DHS\u2019s Chief FOIA Officer was required by law to complete and transmit to the Attorney General and the Office of Government Information Services its FY22 Chief FOIA Officer Annual report by February 1, 2023. 5 U.S.C. 552(e)(1). This report should have been made available for inspection by the public in electronic format. 5 USC 552(e)(3). DHS was supposed to ensure the Attorney General could link this report for public inspection by electronic means no later than March 1, 2023. 5 USC 552(e)(4)\r\n\r\nThe last two required acts have not happened as of today, as reflected by DOJ\u2019s page -  https://www.justice.gov/oip/reports-1 and DHS\u2019s page: https://www.dhs.gov/dhs-chief-foia-officer-reports. Indeed, since 2011 DHS has *never* published its Chief FOIA Officer Annual Report by March 1, according to the agency\u2019s own website.  Refusing public access to this basic, statutorily required information is a means of depriving FOIA requesters of information Congress determined was necessary to ensure the Act is functioning, and agencies are not serially violating the law. Failure to disclose this information undermines public trust in the agency and compromises claims that it can be presumed to operate within its statutory limits. It further raises serious questions of government misfeasance, given that the Chief FOIA Officer of the agency is apparently unable to timely discharge a specific non-negotiable duty imposed by the Congress specifically on that officer. \r\n\r\nPlease: \r\n1. Acknowledge this request within the statutorily required period of 10 days and assign it an individualized tracking number. \r\n2. Make a determination within 20 working days of whether the agency intends to comply with this request. \r\n3. Notify us of the estimated date on which the agency intends to comply, or issue a timely, written denial if no compliance can be expected. \r\n4. Make all reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions of the requested records promptly available. \r\n5. Cease violation of 5 USC 552(e)(1)-(3) and post the FY22 Chief FOIA Officer Report for the Department of Homeland Security without further delay. \r\n6. Assign this request to the Simple track. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado \r\n\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.",
