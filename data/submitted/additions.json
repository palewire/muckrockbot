The current org chart for OPM\u2019s FOIA Office, reflecting vacancies as of February 18, 2025.\r\n\r\n2. The org chart for OPM\u2019s FOIA Office on January 18, 2025, reflecting any vacancies on that date. \r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nI hereby request expedited processing of this request. CNN reported all employees of OPM FOIA were terminated on or around February 17, 2025. If true, this would render the office unable to meet its statutory obligations, potentially violating the Anti-Deficiency Act, and thus, raising issues as to whether the President\u2019s team is in violation of the Constitution\u2019s Take Care clause.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",
