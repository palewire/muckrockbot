All communications regarding this request are public and will be disclosed as appropriate. \r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer, \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Oregon Public Records Law (ORS 192.311 \u2013 192.478), I request access to the following records related to Sidney Mecham\u2019s arrest, investigation, and prosecution for driving through the closed Rose Festival Grand Floral Parade on June 10, 2023. Mecham was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, making all related law enforcement records subject to public disclosure. \r\n\r\nI formally demand the preservation of all responsive records, including but not limited to: \r\n\u2022 Body-worn camera footage \r\n\u2022 Dashcam recordings \r\n\u2022 911 call recordings and transcripts \r\n\u2022 Police dispatch logs \r\n\u2022 Arrest reports and investigative files \r\n\u2022 Internal police communications related to the case \r\n\r\nDestroying, altering, or withholding these records without legal justification could constitute a violation of public records law and a due process violation under Chaudhry v. City of Los Angeles, 751 F.3d 1096 (9th Cir. 2014). Further, Public Citizen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989) reaffirms the public\u2019s right to government transparency. \r\n\r\n1. Body-Worn Camera (BWC) Footage \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\u2022 All footage from officers who responded to Sidney Mecham\u2019s incident on June 10, 2023. \r\n\r\nLegal Basis: \r\n\u2022 ORS 133.741 requires law enforcement to retain and disclose BWC footage unless exempt. \r\n\u2022 ACLU of Nevada v. City of Las Vegas, 333 F.3d 1092 (9th Cir. 2003) confirmed that police bodycam recordings are subject to public records laws. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 133.741 \r\n\r\n2. Dashcam Footage \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\u2022 All police vehicle dashcam recordings related to Mecham\u2019s arrest. \r\n\r\nLegal Basis: \r\n\u2022 ORS 192.345(3) requires disclosure of police video records unless they interfere with an active case, which is not applicable here. \r\n\u2022 Hayden v. City of Portland, 183 Or App 647 (2002) established mandatory disclosure of non-exempt police records. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.345(3) \r\n\r\n3. 911 Call Recordings and Transcripts \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\u2022 All 911 call recordings and transcripts related to Mecham\u2019s actions and arrest. \r\n\r\nLegal Basis: \r\n\u2022 ORS 192.345(3) states that 911 calls are public records unless an exemption applies. \r\n\u2022 State v. Worthington, 138 Or App 104 (1995) upheld that 911 call transcripts must be disclosed unless privacy outweighs public interest. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.345(3) \r\n\r\n4. Police Dispatch Audio and Transcripts \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\u2022 All officer-dispatch communications related to Sidney Mecham\u2019s arrest. \r\n\r\nLegal Basis: \r\n\u2022 ORS 192.311 provides for the disclosure of police communication records. \r\n\u2022 New York Times Co. v. NASA, 852 F.2d 602 (D.C. Cir. 1988) affirmed that public agencies must disclose internal communications unless an exemption applies. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.311 \r\n\r\n5. Arrest and Booking Reports \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\u2022 Complete arrest and booking reports related to Mecham\u2019s case, including officer narratives. \r\n\r\nLegal Basis: \r\n\u2022 ORS 192.345(3) mandates disclosure of completed law enforcement reports. \r\n\u2022 Afshar v. Dept. of State, 702 F.2d 1125 (D.C. Cir. 1983) held that agencies must disclose non-exempt portions of law enforcement records. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.345(3) \r\n\r\n6. Investigative Case Files & Final Police Reports \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\u2022 All finalized investigative reports, officer statements, and internal police memos regarding the Mecham case. \r\n\r\nLegal Basis: \r\n\u2022 ORS 192.345(3) confirms that records in closed cases are subject to public disclosure. \r\n\u2022 Landano v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 508 U.S. 165 (1993) held that FBI investigative reports must be disclosed unless explicitly exempted. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.345(3) \r\n\r\n7. Mugshot and Booking Photos \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\u2022 Any official mugshot taken of Sidney Mecham at the time of his arrest. \r\n\r\nLegal Basis: \r\n\u2022 ORS 192.355 allows for the disclosure of booking photos unless explicitly exempted. \r\n\u2022 Detroit Free Press v. DOJ, 829 F.3d 478 (6th Cir. 2016) held that mugshots are public records unless there is a compelling exemption. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.355 \r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver \r\n\r\nPursuant to ORS 192.324(5), I request a waiver of all fees as this request serves the public interest in promoting transparency regarding law enforcement actions and public safety policies. \r\n\u2022 Public Citizen v. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989) held that government information disclosure fosters accountability. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.324(5) \r\n\r\nPreservation of Records \r\n\r\nI formally demand that all responsive records be preserved under: \r\n\u2022 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3106 (prohibiting unlawful destruction of public records). \r\n\u2022 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (ensuring preservation of records subject to FOIA requests). \r\n\r\nConclusion \r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide: \r\n\u2022 A written explanation citing the specific FOIA exemptions invoked. \r\n\u2022 All segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. \r\n\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request and provide an estimated timeline for processing. If clarification is needed, I can be reached at Jordan@Lassiter.eu. \r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nJordan Lassiter \r\nInvestigative Journalist \r\nJordan@Lassiter.eu \r\nYou requested a fee waiver. \u00a0The City considered the information you provided and evaluated whether providing the requested records would primarily benefit the public then balanced that interest against the burden to the Police Bureau.\u00a0 Even if the City assumed that you articulated a public interest, the burden on the Police Bureau to research and provide the requested records outweighs the public interest. Therefore your fee waiver is denied and payment is required for the requested records. \r\nSincerely, \r\nRyan Rees \r\nPortland Police Bureau - Digital & Public Records Unit 503-823-0756 \r\nIf you are having technical difficulties with the website, please contact the website administrator by phone or email. \u00a0(503) 823-6040 or prrhelp@portlandoregon.gov",

        "communication": "Dear FOIL Appeals Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing in regard to Freedom of Information Law request sent to the City on 05/03/2022 (attached.)\r\n\r\nPlease consider this a formal appeal under Public Officers Law 89(4)(A) of the constructive denial of that request. I say constructive denial because the City has simply failed to respond in a timely manner to my request.\r\n\r\nIn a FOIL request I submitted on 05/03/2022 I asked for \u201cAll communications in your possession, of any type whatsoever, to and from the Five-Borough Chamber Alliance and/or its members, including but not limited to Lisa Sorin, President of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce; Randy Peers, President and CEO of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce; Jessica Walker, President and CEO of the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce; Tom Grech, President and CEO of the Queens Chamber of Commerce; and Linda Baran, President and CEO of the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been more than two years. To date, I have received neither the records sought nor a denial of the request. I received recognition of my FOIL request but have not received further communication, the requested documents, or a denial.\r\n\r\nThe city's approach to my request is simply unlawful. It is inconsistent with both the language and intent of FOIL.\r\n\r\nAs the state\u2019s Committee on Open Government, tasked with interpreting FOIL matters, has said, under FOIL, \u201can agency cannot engage in one delay after another.\u201d FOIL AO-18008(Feb. 22, 2010). Yet, this is exactly how the city council has responded to my request, sending me only one correspondence.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Public Officers Law 89(3)(a), as amended by the Legislature in 2005, an agency must within five business days of receipt of a written request for records make the record sought available, deny access and give reasons for the denial, or furnish an acknowledgement of receipt and state the approximate date when the request will be dealt with. The statute further specifies that the approximate date for addressing a request on its merits should not exceed 20 business days from the date of the acknowledgement of the receipt of the request. A failure by an agency to conform to this statutorily mandated time frame constitutes a constructive denial. See Public Officers Law 89(4)(a). The statute was written as such to ensure FOIL requestors are not, as here, subjected to endless delays by agencies that choose to open their files to the public (which was precisely why FOIL was passed in the first place).\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Committee on Open Government makes clear that \u201cin the rare situation in which it is found that more than 20 additional business days are needed [to address the merits of a request], the agency may do so, with an explanation of the reason for the delay and an indication of a \u201cdate certain,\u201d a self-imposed deadline by which it will grant access to the records in whole or in part (see regulations of the Committee on Open Government, 21 NYCRR 1401.5). When the date certain is reasonable in consideration of attendant facts and circumstances, the agency would be complying with law. There is no provision that permits agencies to indicate extension after extension.\u201d FOIL AO-18008 (emphasis added). See also FOIL-AO 16095 (Dec. 13, 2007) (noting that \u201cthe amendments [to FOIL] clearly are intended to prohibit agencies from unnecessarily delaying disclosure.\u201d). A series of generic notifications over a period of months saying that a response is forthcoming does not meet this standard under FOIL.\r\n\r\nFurther, as recognized by the New York Court of Appeals, FOIL itself contains \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s own unmistakably broad declaration that \u2026 it is incumbent upon the state and its localities to extend public accountability wherever and whenever feasible.\u201d Westchester Newspapers, Inc. v Kimball, 50 NY2d 575,579 (1980) (emphasis added), quoting Section 84 of FOIL. Therefore, where, as here, records are clearly available to the public under FOIL, or are readily retrievable, there may be no basis for a delay in disclosures.\r\n\r\nAs I know of no grounds in FOIL for the denial of the request, and the city has given none, I ask that this appeal be granted and that the records sought be produced promptly.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nJake Offenhartz\r\nAssociated Press\r\n212 621 1605",

If you have requested only paper documentation, these do not require a charge unless the report is length or requires significant redaction. \r\n3. Florida Statute 119 does not require a governmental body to create new information, to do legal research, or to answer questions. \r\nIf any of the above factors change your request, you can reply to this email with the modifications you would like to make.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. If you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-338-1050 or by email at Erinstewart@cfjj.org. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Stewart\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Documents mentioning or relating to Donald Henry Rumsfeld (July 9, 1932 \u2013\r\n    June 29, 2021), an American politician, government official, and businessman\r\n    who served as Secretary of Defense from 1975 to 1977 under Gerald Ford, and\r\n    again from 2001 to 2006 under George W.

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nRylee Meints\r\nJ.D. Candidate\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration \r\nmeints.r@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRylee Meints",

Deputy Lane, 27, was found off-duty and asleep at the wheel of his personal vehicle at a gas station around 2 a.m. He was subsequently arrested for DUI and placed on administrative leave without pay pending an Internal Affairs investigation.\r\n\r\nI am requesting the following records related to this incident:\r\n\r\nAll available body-worn camera footage from deputies involved in the response and arrest of Deputy Jonathon Michael Lane.\r\nAll available dashboard camera (dashcam) footage from patrol vehicles present at the scene.\r\nThe complete incident and arrest reports, including all officer narratives, supplemental reports, and witness statements.\r\nAll 911 call recordings and dispatch logs related to this incident, including radio communications and Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) reports.\r\nAny photographs taken by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office during or after the arrest, including images of the suspect, his vehicle, and the scene.\r\nThe full arrest affidavits and any related charging documents filed in this case.\r\nAny internal reviews, use-of-force reports, or investigations conducted by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office regarding this incident.\r\nAny press releases, social media posts, or official statements made by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office regarding this incident.\r\nThe primary goal of this request is to serve the public interest by making these records publicly accessible. While I acknowledge that I may also generate revenue from disseminating these materials, the request primarily aims to enhance transparency regarding this law enforcement incident.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees associated with fulfilling this request, as disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding of law enforcement practices and actions. However, if a full fee waiver is not possible, please inform me of the estimated costs in advance. Additionally, if fees can be reduced or eliminated by excluding certain records, please specify which records those would be.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records in an electronic format if available. If any portions of this request are denied, please cite the specific legal exemption(s) and provide a redacted version of the document where applicable.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPolice Cam News",

The Email on Feb 26, 2025 12:19 PM, says, \"I will get back to you as soon as possible on the other items we discussed,\" and at 2:19 it says \"I should have most of your original requests shortly.\" - I do not see any records showing what those original requests were or any follow-up with what those items were and when they were provided. Please provide the missing documents or explain.\r\n3. The March 5, 2025 11:313 email states, \"I am getting updates on your other queries,\" but the results or the nature of the queries themselves seem to be missing. Please provide or explain.\r\n4.
