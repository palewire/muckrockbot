Any materials or programming (including handouts, slideshows, videos, textbooks, or other media) used in connection with providing training or guidance to law-enforcement officers in your agency with respect to any of the following subjects: (a) The First Amendment; (b) protests or demonstrations; (c) freedom of speech or expression; (d) filming police officers. This request is limited to materials used in trainings since January 1, 2020; \r\n2. Any policy concerning whether trainings on the topics mentioned in (1) are mandatory, or regulating the frequency of such trainings; and \r\n3. A copy of any document sufficient to show the most recent training conducted for law-enforcement officers in your agency with respect to any of the subjects in.  Your request was received in this office on 8/25/2025. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-56528. Please use this number in future correspondence. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

        "communication": "Adam  Steinbaugh \r\nN/A \r\nMuckRock News, DEPT MR191862 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \r\n\r\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2025-ICFO-56528 \r\n\r\nDear Requester: \r\n\r\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 8/25/2025.  You have requested records pertaining to: 1. Any materials or programming (including handouts, slideshows, videos, textbooks, or other media) used in connection with providing training or guidance to law-enforcement officers in your agency with respect to any of the following subjects: (a) The First Amendment; (b) protests or demonstrations; (c) freedom of speech or expression; (d) filming police officers. This request is limited to materials used in trainings since January 1, 2020; \r\n2. Any policy concerning whether trainings on the topics mentioned in (1) are mandatory, or regulating the frequency of such trainings; and \r\n3. A copy of any document sufficient to show the most recent training conducted for law-enforcement officers in your agency with respect to any of the subjects in. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \r\n\r\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \r\n\r\nA search of the ICE Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) for records responsive to your request produced 5 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 5 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure internal agency case numbers and internal agency URLs contained within the document. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I have determined that disclosure of certain law enforcement sensitive information contained within the responsive records could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Fleck,\r\n\r\nThank you for your follow-up regarding your public records request submitted on October 13, 2025. I\u2019d like to clarify that in my previous correspondence, I indicated we would provide an update by November 14, not a completed response. Given the size and complexity of your request, as well as the Division\u2019s current workload, we will require additional time to complete our review and compilation of responsive records.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we are providing a list that we believe is responsive to Parts 1 and 2 of your request. This list includes: (a) water rights or applications for water rights submitted by Vidler Water Company, Dorothy Timian-Palmer, and D.R. Horton (the \u201cnamed entities\u201d); and (b) water rights for which we have a record of purchase, sale, or transfer involving one or more of these entities.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this list does not distinguish between Part 1 and Part 2 of your request; the information is combined. If you would prefer that the information be separated by request item, please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate.\r\n\r\nWe are not providing copies of applications or permits at this time, as those documents are publicly accessible through the Division\u2019s online permit search tool, available here: https://tools.water.nv.gov/PermitSearch.aspx\r\n\r\nIf you are seeking more than just the application or permit (e.g., the entire permit file), please let us know. If a permit file is already in electronic format, we can provide it pursuant to NRS 239.010(4). If it is not available electronically, you may inspect the file in person at our office. Please note that providing full copies of permit files will require additional time.\r\n\r\nWe also have several clarifying questions regarding the remainder of your request (Parts 3\u20139):\r\n\r\n  *   Part 3: You request \u201ca copy of all wells owned.\u201d The Division does not track well ownership directly, but rather manages water rights, which include points of diversion such as wells. If you are seeking information about points of diversion, those can be viewed in the applications and permits available through the online database linked above.\r\n  *   Part 4: This request includes several components:\r\n     *   (a) The Division does not issue a document formally titled as \u201cwell drilling permit.\u201d Instead, we process Notices of Intent (NOIs) to drill wells and receive well logs after drilling. If you are seeking well logs associated with wells held by the named entities, you may search by owner using our well log database here: https://tools.water.nv.gov/WellLogQuery.aspx. Please let us know if you have any questions, need assistance, or if this does not satisfy this portion of your request.\r\n     *   (b) Regarding \u201cwell monitoring reports,\u201d we issue monitoring waivers for the drilling of/conversion to monitoring wells and receive some depth-to-water measurements for those wells. We also receive pumpage reports for certain wells. Could you please clarify whether you are requesting submitted pumpage reports, depth-to-water data, or both? If you are seeking water level data, you may find it through our water level database here: https://tools.water.nv.gov/WaterLevelData.aspx\r\n     *   (c) The phrase \u201cmaterials referenced in applications\u201d is quite broad. Could you please specify what types of materials you are seeking?\r\n  *   Part 7: You request \u201ca copy of all protests\u201d filed against the named entities. The permit search database referenced above also includes a tab labeled \u201cAbrogations/Protests/Rulings\u201d that can be used to view protest information, if an application was protested. This can be used in combination with the list we\u2019ve provided in response to Parts 1 and 2.\r\n  *   Part 9: You request \u201ca copy of all petitions for review of canceled permits.\u201d Could you confirm whether this request is limited to petitions involving Vidler Water Company, Dorothy Timian-Palmer, and D.R. Horton?\r\n\r\nOnce we receive clarification on the above items, we will be able to provide an updated timeline for processing the remainder of your request. In the meantime, we will continue working on it to the best of our ability.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work to fulfill this request. Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out with clarifications or preferences regarding the format or scope of the records you are seeking.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DC5553.1B210E70]<http://water.nv.gov/>\r\n\r\nJames Henson, Esq.\r\nChief Administrative Law Judge | Hearings Section\r\nNevada Division of Water Resources\r\nDepartment of Conservation and Natural Resources\r\n901 S.

This link provides access to all records indicated below.\r\n\r\nWe are providing records responsive to Parts 5, 6, and 8 of your request as follows:\r\n\r\nPART 5 \u2013 Copies of Emails, Phone Calls, Teams, and/or Text Messages\r\n\r\nWe have located and are providing emails responsive to this portion of your request. In addition, we are including two call logs. Please note that these logs have been REDACTED to remove non-responsive portions (e.g., calls unrelated to the named entities).\r\n\r\nPART 6 \u2013 Proof of Beneficial Use Applications (2020\u20132025)\r\n\r\nWe located two certificated water rights responsive to this request. These are Permit 80648, Certificate 19594, and Permit 80649, Certificate 19595.\r\n\r\nThese records do not appear to exist in an electronic format and are not required to be created in such a format pursuant to NRS 239.010(4). However, you may visit our Carson City office, where the front desk will make the records available for your inspection.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may search our Permits Database by owner name. Under the Maps and Due Dates tab, you can identify any additional permits that may have been certificated by the named entities. Here is a link to the Permits Database: Permit Search<http://ndwrintranet/permitsearch>.\r\n\r\nPART 8 \u2013 Public Comments or Complaints Regarding Named Entities\r\n\r\nWe conducted an electronic search of our database for instances of the three named entities within 10 words of the terms \u201ccomment\u201d or \u201ccomplaint.\u201d This search returned zero matches.\r\n\r\nIf you believe a specific hearing included a comment or complaint concerning one of the named entities, please let us know. That information may help us focus the request further. However, based on our current search, we have not located any responsive records.\r\n\r\nBecause we did not receive clarification on the remaining portions of your request (Parts 3, 4, 7, and 9), we consider this response COMPLETE and the matter CLOSED.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or wish to submit a new request with additional details.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DC8F8F.A4AD5330]<http://water.nv.gov/>\r\n\r\nJames Henson, Esq.\r\nChief Administrative Law Judge | Hearings Section\r\nNevada Division of Water Resources\r\nDepartment of Conservation and Natural Resources\r\n901 S.

When I put in the whole title (\"Does v....-05059) I got something in MIssouri. The only other thing I could fin is a recent court case where plaintiffs asked for a mandamus writ to instruct the executive branch to prioritize categories of inmates at high risk for COVID as well as balancing community safety and other release factors they normally take into account. \r\n\r\nYou've gotten my request right. Partly I'm asking because even though I've talked to several other trans activists, none of them seem to know where trans men are sent. From what I hear, trans women are usually sent to Monroe CC. But I wonder if it's always been that way? Or if there are plans to do something different in the future. That's part of why I asked for such a long timeframe. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAdam",

I found out that there was a court case (Does v. DOC, et al: USDC Cause No. 4:21-cv-05059) with a restraining order prohibiting release of information regarding trans inmates and related issues. So my FOIA request couldn't be fulfilled at that time. Just as a summary, the original request was for:\r\n\r\n1. The total number of transgender individuals who are currently incarcerated in a DOC facility broken down by \"trans men\" and \"trans women\".\r\n2. What facility DOC houses trans individuals at.\r\n3. Number of transgender individuals housed in solitary confinement and/or isolation from 2010-2020. \r\n\r\nFor clarification on number 2, what I'm looking for is any sort of policy or directive, email, or other writing showing a practice of \"trans female inmates go to (X) facility, trans male inmates go to (Y) facility\". An example, from what I've heard, trans women tend to go to Monroe. But no one seems to know where trans men go. And I'm wondering if that's an unwritten practice that developed over time or policy.\r\n\r\nSo I thought I'd check in and see if the restraining order has been lifted and that information is now available to be released.\r\nThank you\r\nAdam Allen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This individual is seen from the angle of another person's BWC, trying to unlock tiny lock boxes with keys found around the property, additionally tossing about the personal belongings of an entire house, in a reckless, damaging and unprofessional manner, showing little to no regard for preservation and documentation of the items found and seized. He is also seen tampering with a cell phone found on a computer table and reading through personal letters/papers. None of which is permitted via the Search Warrant. \r\n\r\nA ton of time was spent loitering the area, alongside Trevor Herrud from WSP, AND Cole Hecker from Grandview from about 15:00 to 18:40. Lionel left no supplemental narratives of being present at this incident, but was mentioned by one officers narrative report. The aftermath of this Search and Seizure execution is volatile. \r\n\r\n Lionel Carmona has recently been included in an WSCJTC complaint that is undergoing an investigation with Yakima County Internal Affair's dept, alongside 13 other officers. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is additional information I can provide, at your request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Part of my transition into this role has been to review outstanding requests and attempt to bring them to a resolution. It has come to my attention that your May 8, 2025 public records request to the City remains outstanding. This request sought the following: Pursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law (M.G.L. c.66, \u00a710), I respectfully request access to all records, documents, and communications related to the hiring process for the Microsoft 365 Administrator position within the Department of Innovation & Technology, City of Worcester, posted in 2025.As \r\n\r\nThis request includes, but is not limited to: \r\n\r\n1. **All interview materials**, including: \r\n- Interview scoresheets, panelist rankings, written or digital evaluations \r\n- Any compiled assessments, rubrics, candidate comparison summaries, or recommendation memos \r\n\r\n2. **All internal communications** related to the hiring process, including: \r\n- Emails, memos, letters, Microsoft Teams or Slack messages, and calendar invites \r\n- Meeting recordings, scheduling threads, and attachments \r\n- Communications sent or received by Michael Hamel, Samantha Sendrowski, **Moby George**, HR personnel, interview panelists, or any Department of Innovation & Technology leadership \r\n- Specifically covering any candidates, test results, decision timelines, or escalation concerns \r\n- From April 1, 2025 to the present date \r\n\r\n3. **Hiring process documentation**, such as: \r\n- Full timeline of job posting, interview scheduling, test administration, debriefs, and offer stages \r\n- Number of applicants, screening procedures, and filtering criteria \r\n- Any instructions or documentation provided to interviewers \r\n\r\n4. **All assessment materials**, including: \r\n- Technical test prompts, evaluation rubrics, scoring forms \r\n- Written/recorded test feedback and related correspondence or commentary \r\n- Internal discussions on the test\u2019s creation, intent, or purpose \r\n\r\n5. **All offer documentation**, including: \r\n- Drafts and final offer letters (candidate names may be redacted) \r\n- Related internal approvals, HR communications, or final decision emails \r\n\r\n6. **Meeting materials**, including: \r\n- Agendas, minutes, summaries, attendance logs, and calendar invites from hiring-related meetings \r\n\r\n7. **Any records referencing candidate follow-up, escalation, reconsideration, or delays**, including: \r\n- Emails or notes discussing communication from candidates \r\n- Internal messages referencing escalation to the CIO or Department leadership \r\n- Records discussing hiring delays, decision deferrals, or process suspension \r\n\r\n8. **Documentation of any changes to the role or reporting structure**, including: \r\n- Revisions to the job description, responsibilities, or departmental ownership of the Microsoft 365 Administrator role \r\n- Especially any such documentation involving Samantha Sendrowski or **Moby George** \r\n\r\nPlease include **all responsive documents from April 1, 2025 through the present**, including any drafts, tracked changes, metadata, or attachments. I request these records be provided **electronically** in original formats (.pdf, .msg, .docx, .eml, etc.), with metadata preserved where applicable. \r\ninitial matter your request for \"all records, documents, and communications related to the hiring process for the Microsoft 365 Administrator position within the Department of Innovation & Technology, City of Worcester, posted in 2025.\" fails to reasonably describe the record or category of records that you are seeking. The Suffolk Superior Court found that under the Public Records Law \u201c[t]he reasonable description requirement contemplates that a requesting party will identify documents or categories of documents with sufficient particularity that government employees will be able to understand exactly what they are looking for, and then make a prompt production.\u201d See Jaideep Chawla v. Dept of Revenue, Suffolk. Sup. No. l 784CV02087, at 2 (January 23, 2019).\u00a0The court further indicated \u201c[r]equests for documents that are articulated with very broad language that calls upon non-lawyer administrative personnel to interpret the scope of what is sought, and then make fine judgments about what documents are and are not sufficiently \u2018related\u2019 to the category of materials requested, will not satisfy this statutory standard.\u201d\u00a0 Accordingly, your request for a virtually unlimited scope of documents \"...related to the hiring process for the Microsoft 365 Administrator position within the Department of Innovation & Technology, City of Worcester, posted in 2025\" is not sufficiently particular as to satisfy the statutory standard of a request that \u201creasonably described the public record sought.\u201d See G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(a)(i). \r\nI will now proceed to address the enumerated categories of your request. With regards to the items sought by categories one (all interview materials) and four (all assessment materials) these requests seek records that are exempt under\u00a0Exemption (L) of the Public Records Law. These records constitute questions and answers, scoring keys and sheets and other materials used to develop, administer or score job interviews for the Microsoft 365 Administrator and similar positions within the City's government. The City frequently reuses identical or very similar questions when conducting job interviews. To release these records would risk future candidates gaining an unfair advantage when interviewing with the City.\u00a0 The City will also withhold \"[a]ny instructions or documentation provided to interviewers\" and \"screening procedures, and filtering criteria\" under\u00a0Exemption (L) for the reasons noted above. \r\nWith regards to the portions of your requests that seek communications from the City and between City employees,\u00a0pursuant to G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(b)(vii), it is valid for the City to suggest a \u201creasonable modification of the scope of the request or offer to assist the requestor to modify the scope of the request if doing so would enable the City to produce records sought more efficiently and affordably.\u201d See G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(b)(vii). In order for the City to search for communications responsive to your request, I would suggest that you provide key words for the communications that you are searching for and specific city employees or departments who you believe may have records responsive to your request (I understand that for some of the items sought that you provided names of City employees) but it would be helpful to expand this for all communications sought.\u00a0 In addition to the aforementioned suggestions, it may also be useful to narrow the date range of your request. \r\nWith regards to your request for \"[a]ll offer documentation\" (category 5), the City will withhold all offer letters under\u00a0Exemption (c), offer letters are found within City employees personnel files and are therefore\u00a0exempt from disclosure. See Colman M. Herman v. City of Boston, et. al., Suffolk Superior Court, Civil Action No. 2384CV2395 (June 20, 2024) (\u201cpersonnel files . . . shall be considered exempt under exemption (c)\") \r\nFinally in light of the time elapsed since you placed your public records request, should you wish to withdraw this request, please let me know and the City can consider this request closed. \r\nUnder the Public Records Law, I must inform you that you have the right to appeal this response to the Supervisor of Records pursuant to subsection (a) of section 10A of the Public Records Law and 950 CMR 32.08(1). You also have the right to seek judicial review of an unfavorable decision by commencing a civil action in the superior court under subsection (c) of section 10A. \r\nSincerely, \r\nMichael Manning \r\nRecords Access Officer \r\nCity of Worcester Law Department",

Unfortunately, this office does not have a breakdown or listing of each DCF care facility that operates within the City of Methuen, so I will only be able to research the locations you previously provided.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the Methuen Police Department has utilized 3 separate reporting platforms since January 2020 to present and we do not have a way to search arrests at specific locations.

This concludes our search of records in the custody of the Bellevue Police Department. Please be advised, we are not permitted to upload records to external websites. If there is a different method of your receipt you would prefer, such as direct email, pickup, mailing, or in-person inspection, please let us know. This is our final, definitive response and your request is closed.\u00a0 As the city does not intend to further address the request, the Public Records Act one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review has now started to run. Pursuant to the Public Records Act RCW 42.56, responsive records may be redacted or exempt. Please review the accompanying privilege log for further information, if such redactions or exemptions have been applied. Per the State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56.120) and City Public Records Act Rules (Section 6), a public records request may be considered abandoned and subsequently closed if a requestor fails to fulfill their obligation to claim an installment of records; claim the entire production of records; inspect the records; or fails to pay the deposit or final payment for requested records within 30 days of this notification. If you believe the information furnished has been incorrectly redacted or is incomplete, you may file a written appeal. The appeal must include your name and address, a copy of the redacted document and a copy of this letter together with a brief statement identifying the basis of the appeal. Please mail your appeal to: Bellevue Police Department \r\nAttn: Records Supervisor \r\nP.O. Box 90012 \r\nBellevue, WA\u00a0 98009-9012 If you require any further assistance from the Bellevue Police Department regarding this matter or have questions, please contact the Records Unit via the Public Records Portal or by telephone at (425) 452-6917 within 30 days of this notification.

Public Records Request Fee Invoices (2020\u2013Present)\r\n\r\nPlease provide complete electronic copies of all invoices issued by Lake Washington School District (\u201cthe District\u201d) for public records requests, covering the date range of January 1, 2020 through [today\u2019s date in 2025].\r\n\r\nThis request includes but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- All invoices, billing statements, or itemized charges for fees assessed for fulfilling Public Records Act requests.\r\n- Any fee estimates or final invoices issued to requestors.\r\n- Supporting calculations, line items, or spreadsheets attached to fee invoices.\r\n- Records reflecting the method of fee assessment under RCW 42.56.120 or related statutes.\r\n- Records showing the number of files, pages, or gigabytes associated with each invoice or fee assessment.\r\n\r\n2. Scope of Records\r\n\r\nThis request applies to all responsive records created, stored, transmitted, or retained by the District for the years 2020 through 2025, including:\r\n\r\n- Electronic invoices in PDF, DOCX, XLSX, MSG, or other native formats.\r\n- Itemized billing spreadsheets or fee calculation documents.\r\n- Records stored on District servers, computers, or cloud services used for invoice generation or distribution.\r\n\r\n3. Format of Production & Delivery\r\n\r\n- Provide all records in their native electronic format (e.g., PDF, XLSX, DOCX).\r\n- If necessary, bundle responsive records into the fewest files possible using free .zip compression.\r\n- Production should be in reverse chronological order (most recent first).\r\n- Delivery Method:\r\n  - Direct email attachment, or\r\n  - Direct internet download link with no password and no registration required.\r\n- Expressly prohibited: Do not require use of JustFOIA, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAOnline, or any similar third-party portal.\r\n\r\n4. Exemption Logs\r\n\r\nIf any redactions or withholdings are made, the District must provide a detailed exemption log, identifying:\r\n- The statutory RCW exemption invoked.\r\n- The record type and specific withheld portion.\r\n- The number of invoices, pages, or documents withheld in whole or redacted.\r\n\r\n5. Fees\r\n\r\nIf fees apply to the production of this request, please provide an itemized fee estimate in advance. Artificial inflation of costs by fragmenting or unbundling records that could reasonably be produced together is not permissible under RCW 42.56.120.\r\n\r\n6. Preservation of Records\r\n\r\nThis request anticipates litigation. Under RCW 42.56.100 and WAC 44-14-03005, the District must preserve all potentially responsive invoices and related records until this request is fully resolved. Destruction of responsive records after receipt of this request may constitute a violation of RCW 40.16.010 and RCW 40.16.020.\r\n\r\n7. Exemption Challenge \r\n\r\n- Public Record Status: All fee invoices and billing records are \u201cwritings\u201d under RCW 42.56.010(4), as they are prepared, used, or retained by the District in connection with the performance of a governmental function.\r\n- No Blanket Exemption: There is no statutory exemption for public records fee invoices. Exemptions must be specific, narrowly applied, and accompanied by a detailed exemption log (Sanders v. State, 169 Wn.2d 827 (2010)).\r\n- Judicial Review: If LWSD denies access, I will seek judicial review under RCW 42.56.550, including recovery of attorney fees and statutory penalties per day per record unlawfully withheld (Yousoufian v. Office of Ron Sims, 168 Wn.2d 444 (2010)).\r\n\r\n8. Commercial Purpose Declaration\r\n\r\nThis request is not made for any commercial purpose and does not seek a \u201clist of individuals\u201d as prohibited by RCW 42.56.070(8).\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease provide responsive records within five business days as required by RCW 42.56.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

A fee has been issued for your request for records.\r\nFollowing the submission of your request, a preliminary search was completed. The estimated volume of records and associated costs are detailed in the invoice provided. District policy requires that you be provided with a summary of applicable anticipated charges before charges are imposed. This is to allow the requestor to revise the request in an effort to reduce the applicable charges. To this end, a detailed invoice is provided separately for your review.

Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n2. Five cents per each four electronic files or attachments uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\nAlternatively, if the District determines and documents that the fees allowed under this procedure are clearly equal to, or less, than two dollars, the District may instead charge a flat fee of two dollars to provide the records. If the District charges a flat fee for the first installment, the District will not charge an additional flat fee or a per page fee for any subsequent installments.\r\nDue to the volume of records, the District is exercising its discretion under District procedure and RCW 42.56.120(4) to require a deposit of ten percent of the estimated charges associated with this request.\r\nAfter payment is received, we will be authorized by District procedure and the Public Records Act to begin reviewing the responsive records. At that point, we will provide you with the anticipated date of an initial installment.\r\nPlease be advised that we are required to allow you a 30-day time frame to make the pre-payment as outlined above, measured from the date of this email. A failure to receive such payment from a requester within that time frame permits us to consider their request abandoned and close it. Also, the District would also be amenable to narrowing the scope of your request in an effort to reduce the associated fees the District intends to assess.\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing or any aspect of the District's work to fulfill your request.\r\nTo view your request status, please click Request Number: PRR-2025-241<https://lwsdwa.justfoia.com/PublicPortal/Index?RequestNumber=PRR-2025-241&SecurityKey=6D0290CB>\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nPublic Records Office\r\n15212 NE 95th Street\r\nRedmond, WA 98052\r\npublicrecordsrequest@lwsd.org",

Please click on the request link to download the response documentation. \r\n  \r\n Your request, PRR-2025-241, is considered complete as we provided all records we were able to provide. \r\n  \r\n All invoices for Public Records Act request fees from 2020\u20132025 have been provided in their native PDF format. These invoices include the itemized charges, fee calculations, number of files, and the method of fee assessment, which satisfy the scope of your request. \r\n  \r\n The District does not maintain separate fee estimates, calculation spreadsheets, or attachments beyond what is already included in the invoices. Fee calculations are generated within the District\u2019s database system, and no additional calculation files exist. Notification emails sent to requesters do not contain fee information or invoices and are therefore not responsive. \r\n  \r\n Some invoices include a mailing or email address in the address field, and some do not. The address field only populates when the requester entered an address or email address in the address field at the time the invoice was created. If no address was provided, the field appears blank; however, the invoice was still delivered to the requester by email. This variation reflects the information supplied by the requester and does not indicate any missing records. \r\n  \r\n Some public records requests received during the date range had not yet been invoiced at the time of your request. Because no invoice existed for those requests, there were no responsive records to produce for them. \r\n  \r\n For general information about how the District calculates Public Records Act fees, the District\u2019s fee schedule is publicly available on our website. This information is not a responsive record but is provided for convenience. https://url4102.request.justfoia.com/ls/click?upn=u001.nrfdmL-2B1UhWpB4V2ArB2saf7hzZRTWl6NaNk2Ngw2xI94WCmlOAuubZY2eGJvWNCDbiKW-2FoHs-2Fp1FxW-2Fre9NBQ-3D-3DyqTn_h0SuGnas8NGTsUMgZjfTUup1-2F11dC-2BzV3BFgEPTU-2F76cICkW0aA3b9OCc0qi98zMMu1dVi-2Bwm4WOqv5hBFV4MaqlNGMCvCzelSW9YaEqjz0jqkoOuO4deQA-2BIrjs3i0fd40o9f-2BSwzfLrEGZTbO1K6M2frJvwyMvwFWpPaCDXnPbM2NE0-2FrbIHYK095mK0ZS-2FB7X0ZFd-2FUFLNyTn3BZDBZc8rf2F4aWRqzPl0i4NEN313f9e7121adEpmaLyndMGuNMSpAti6lxigeIpFhr-2FqTzocLuPAoDLKaAC2o3AZX7wf-2FUA2SNK8mRl0ifttZzd \r\n  \r\n With this production, the District has provided all records in its possession that are responsive to your request. \r\n  \r\n  Lake Washington School District does not intend to further address the request. Please follow up with any questions within 30 days, which is 2/22/2026. The completed date, 1/22/2026, begins the one-year statute of limitations which allows you to seek judicial review on or before 1/22/2027.  \r\n  \r\n If you'd like to submit any additional public records request please visit: https://url4102.request.justfoia.com/ls/click?upn=u001.nrfdmL-2B1UhWpB4V2ArB2saf7hzZRTWl6NaNk2Ngw2xI94WCmlOAuubZY2eGJvWNCDbiKW-2FoHs-2Fp1FxW-2Fre9NBQ-3D-3Di0ls_h0SuGnas8NGTsUMgZjfTUup1-2F11dC-2BzV3BFgEPTU-2F76cICkW0aA3b9OCc0qi98zMMu1dVi-2Bwm4WOqv5hBFV4MaqlNGMCvCzelSW9YaEqjz0jqkoOuO4deQA-2BIrjs3i0fd40o9f-2BSwzfLrEGZTbO1K2Cv0oEoCGOUaIGi43RZOAHRtk8SgyjuUpJWGJvWTNAag5G-2FKkDLYGQ8SCFsT1Rs9Lp9XAo6JAofcbt3mR3rEhz7oGK6TfN5BjmFqtB41dhvZv0H5yPB6XbSos7zOk4AgDQuWY-2BFlYIz19v0Bw-2BsWCCoR9wxTqmc4xZO7slsiADT  \r\n  \r\n Thank you, \r\n  \r\n \r\nPublic Records Office\r\n15212 NE 95th Street\r\nRedmond, WA 98052\r\n\r\npublicrecordsrequest@lwsd.org",

The Massachusetts Public Records Law does not distinguish between paper and electronic records, and \u201cclearly applies to government records generated, received, or maintained electronically.\u201d SPR Bulletin No. 4-96 (June 7, 1996). A records custodian must \u201cfurnish copies of non-exempt portions of computerized information at the cost of reproduction, unless otherwise provided by law.\u201d  Guide to Mass. Pub. Records Law at 41 (Sec\u2019y of State, rev. Mar. 2020, https://www.sec.state.ma.us/pre/prepdf/guide.pdf.

Id.\r\n\r\nInvisible Institute is an award-winning nonprofit public accountability journalism organization based in Chicago. Our mission is to enhance the capacity of citizens to hold public institutions accountable. Because I, the requestor, am a journalist, and I seek the information in order to disseminate it to the public, and because the information regards the safety, welfare, and legal rights of the general public, I request a fee waiver for this data under 950 CMR 32.07(2)(k). It is not for commercial benefit because I am a member of the nonprofit news media whose principal purpose is to access and disseminate information regarding the general public\u2019s safety, welfare, and legal rights. To the extent you intend to assess any charges, please notify me to discuss first.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",
