He died on 21 May 2023.\r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH\r\nObituaries for Mr. Gray appeared in numerous national media, including the New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/21/obituaries/c-boyden-gray-dead.html and the Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/05/21/c-boyden-gray-white-house-counsel-president-ghw-bush-dies-80/.\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and organizations to see if they contain additional records related to Mr. Gray:\r\n\r\n(1) President George Herbert Walker Bush, to whom the subject served as White House Counsel\r\n(2) Chief Justice Earl Warren, to whom the subject was a law clerk\r\n(3) The Atlantic Counsel, on whose board the subject served\r\n(4) The European Institute, on whose board the subject served\r\n(5) FreedomWorks, on whose board the subject served\r\n(6) The Federalist Society, of which the subject was a member\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray has recently died, so the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray was a public figure. He served as White House Counsel to George H. W. Bush and was the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union. News obituaries for Mr. Gray appeared in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other national media. Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records available online for free via muckrock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that lets people share the results of their FOIA requests and encourages journalism around them.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released until now. Given Mr. Gray's government service as a high-level advisor and employee in the executive and judicial branches, the public's understanding of Mr. Gray, his work, and the work of the government will likely be enhanced significantly.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just an inquisitive citizen. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nThank you for your timely attention to this request.",

        "communication": "Dear OIP:\r\n\r\nI hearby appeal the Bureau's denial of my request for a fee waiver for my FOIPA Request No. 1593177-000 .\r\n\r\n1. The Bureau states that my request failed to meet at least one of the four public interest factors, but it does not say which factor or factors I failed to satisfy or why. This alone is reason enough to reverse the Bureau's decision, because it makes it impossible for the requestor to meaningfully respond to the denial\u2014rendering the denial arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and a denial of due process.\r\n\r\n2. My request meets the legal standard for a fee waiver. The subject of the request was a public figure, with news obituaries of his death appearing in major newspapers, including the New York Times and the Washington Post. Responsive records will be of great interest to historians, political scientists, scholars, the legal academy, and many others. I am making this request via MuckRock.com, which will automatically make all responsive records available to the general public for free. There is simply no reason to deny this fee waiver.\r\n\r\n3. I incorporate by reference the additional arguments I made in my initial request for a fee waiver.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this appeal.\r\n\r\nMost sincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

Each owner possesses a certain percentage of the real property...\"\r\nhttps://thepittmanlawoffice.com/property-ownership-in-florida/\r\n\r\nPer Florida Statute 196.081(1)(a) \u2018Any real estate that is owned and used as a homestead by a veteran who was honorably discharged with a service-connected total and permanent disability and for whom a letter from the United States Government or United States Department of Veterans Affairs or its predecessor has been issued certifying that the veteran is totally and permanently disabled is exempt from taxation, if the veteran is a permanent resident of this state on January 1 of the tax year for which exemption is being claimed or was a permanent resident of this state on January 1 of the year the veteran died.\u2019\r\n \r\nThe statute in question doesn\u2019t say \u201csolely owned.\u201d A plain language reading indicates 127 Delvalle St. would be fully exempt from taxation, even if my ex-wife is listed on the title. \r\n \r\nOn 1/1/2022 Mrs. Parker stated \u201cBecause your ex-wife is still on the title, only half of your value will be protected under your total & permanent exemption. What this means is you will be \u2018taxed\u2019 on the 50% she owns.\u201d \r\n \r\nFurther, the final judgment entered never stated my ex-wife had a 50% ownership stake in the home.\r\n\r\nhe exact amount my wife \u201cowns\u201d of the home is never stated in the final judgment, as the amount listed  included property besides the house. The amount stated that she was owed for an equalizing payment has been paid down to approximately $30,000. \r\n \r\n$30,000 Of $396,910 comes out to 7.6%. So my ex owns approximately 7.6% of the home. \r\n \r\nIs it possible for the county to amend the 2022 property tax amount for 127 Delvalle St. Melbourne Beach, FL? \r\n \r\nMichael Locke\u201c \r\n\r\n\u201cFrom: Ed Pollock <ed.pollock@bcpao.us>\r\nSent: Tuesday, November 22, 2022 2:05 PM\r\nTo: mbl22885@msn.com <mbl22885@msn.com>\r\nSubject: Homestead Exemption Status\r\n \r\nMr. Locke,\r\n \r\nI am writing you based on your recent dialogue with Melissa Parker of this office regarding your homestead exemption.  I understand after several email exchanges you continue to assert you are entitled to exempt 100% of the value your property you currently hold as tenants in common with your former spouse.\r\n \r\nTenants in Common is real property that is shared among more than one owner. Each owner possesses a certain percentage of the real property\u2026\r\n \r\nMelissa correctly advised that you are entitled to a homestead exemption on only the 50% of the value of your home. That decision is based on your divorce final judgement order. The court order clearly states your former spouse retains 50% ownership of the home until your former spouse executes a quit claim deed conveying her interest in the property to you.  The court ordered criteria leading up to the execution of the quit claim deed is not relevant to your current percentage of legal ownership and rights regarding your qualified exemption.\r\n \r\nWhile married you and your spouse were tenants in the entirety. \r\n \r\nTenancy by the entirety in Florida is a form of joint ownership that protects property from creditors of either spouse. With tenants by entireties, both spouses own an undivided interest in 100% of the property. If either spouse dies, the surviving spouse inherits full ownership of tenants by entireties assets.\r\n \r\nYou are qualified for the homestead exemption on the 50% you own, that includes a Total & Permanent Service-Connected exemption, but only on the 50% you own.  The remaining 50% is owned by your former spouse.  You can not exempt what you do not own.  Once a quit claim deed is executed awarding 100% ownership to you; you can file an updated application for the entire value of the property.  \r\n \r\nIf your position is unchanged, I advise you to seek competent legal counsel in this matter.  Please conduct any future inquires directly to me in this matter.\r\n \r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nEd Pollock\r\nSenior Director Customer Service & Compliance\r\nBrevard County Property Appraiser\u201d",

This has all been explained in your communications with Mr. Pollock and Ms. Parker.  As a married couple, you and your then wife were entitled to your total and permanent disability on 100% of the assessed value of the property.  After the divorce, you and your ex-wife share a 50% ownership each.  Your total and permanent exemption can only be placed on your 50% of the value while the other 50% owned by your ex-wife is fully taxable.\r\n\r\nAlso addressed in the previous communications is 50/50 split of the property after the divorce.  This was determined in the final judgement and mechanizations of law, how much she owes or does not owe does not determine her percentage of ownership.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D98899.6AF33D80]\r\n\r\nwww.bcpao.us<http://www.bcpao.us>\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D98899.6AF33D80]<https://www.linkedin.com/company/brevard-county-property-appraiser>[cid:image003.png@01D98899.6AF33D80]<https://twitter.com/brevardpropappr>[cid:image004.png@01D98899.6AF33D80]<https://www.facebook.com/bcpao/>\r\n\r\nGeorge Mascellino, CAE, AAS, CFE\r\nCert Gen RZ2863\r\nChief Deputy Property Appraiser\r\nBrevard County Property Appraiser\r\n\r\nPhone: 321-264-6702\r\nFax: 321-264-5187\r\nEmail: george.mascellino@BCPAO.us<mailto:george.mascellino@BCPAO.us>\r\n400 South Street, 5th floor\r\nTitusville, FL 32780\r\n\r\n[cid:image005.png@01D98899.6AF33D80]<http://www.bcpao.us/>\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Florida law, email addresses are public records.

Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 853 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,786 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,500 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

Specifically, you requested the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  \"Amount invested into new Faregate equipment installation since May 2021.\r\n  2.  Number of new Faregate installations since they have moved to the new model in Summer 2021\r\n  3.  Number of broken faregates in May 2021.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that WMATA is an interstate compact agency created by the Commonwealth of Virginia, State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia, and not a federal agency.  See Pub. L. No. 89-774, 80 Stat. 1324 (1966); Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 33.2-3100; Md. Code Ann., Transp. \u00a7 10-204; D.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 9-1107.1). Accordingly, WMATA is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Therefore, your request will be processed pursuant to WMATA's PARP.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClarification Required for Your Request\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that Part 2 of your request does not specify the timeframe for \"Summer 2021.\" PARP \u00a7 7.5 requires requesters to \"describe the records that are being requested in sufficient detail to enable WMATA to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.\"  Please provide a specific timeframe by close of business, Monday, January 30, 2023, or Part 2 of your request will be closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INFORMATION:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we are not yet able to provide any responsive records, we can impart the following general information regarding your request:\r\n\r\n\r\nTime Period for Processing Requests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWMATA generally aims to respond to a request for records within 20 business days following receipt of the request.  WMATA processes requests in the order that requests are received.  Furthermore, additional processing time is required for requests that prove to be complex, as is the case here.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that your request may include records submitted to WMATA by a third party, which requires us to contact the third party to identify confidential and proprietary information.  WMATA will not release any records until it has had the opportunity to consult with the third party and received appropriate feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExemptions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PARP provides exemptions for certain types of data, including: (1) information that could compromise WMATA infrastructure or security; (2) information that is solely related to the internal personnel rules and practices; (3) information that is exempt by statute; (4) proprietary commercial or financial information; (5) intra-agency and inter-agency memoranda information which would not be made available by law to a party in litigation with WMATA; (6) information that, if released, would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; (7) certain information compiled for law enforcement purposes; (8) registered SmarTrip\u00ae information; and (9) customer financial information.  Generally, WMATA's response will not include any exempt information.\r\n\r\nProcessing Fees\r\n\r\nThe PARP also provides for the assessment of fees associated with a request that requires more than two hours of staff time to process.  These fees are calculated at the employees' basic rate of pay, plus an additional 50 percent to cover benefits, for the time spent responding to a request.  In general, a request is considered an agreement to pay all applicable fees.  Advance payment is required where the fees are likely to exceed $250.\r\n\r\nFuture correspondence should reference the request number noted in the subject line of this correspondence. If you have any questions, please contact Benjamin Rashbaum at brashbaum@wmata.com<mailto:brashbaum@wmata.com> or 202-962-1926.\r\n\r\n[1] The PARP can be found on WMATA's website at https://www.wmata.com/about/records/public-records.cfm<https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wmata.com%2Fabout%2Frecords%2Fpublic-records.cfm&data=05%7C01%7CRDNoh%40wmata.com%7Cf106629fcf374d6e6ed608daf24f081e%7Cad5836f40d7443cd83c57e69eaa67915%7C0%7C0%7C638088718496927242%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=7C%2BADG97KkMvytD992a3%2FXhdZpQHgRu6MMLRflyTseI%3D&reserved=0>, under the section marked \"Legal Affairs.\"\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Ferrari\r\n--\r\n[cid:image003.jpg@01D92739.17EEB7C0]\r\nMichael B.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.  I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to FBI system FBI-003\t- Bureau Mailing Lists, which is described on the Department of Justice's website at https://www.justice.gov/opcl/doj-systems-records#FBI\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Best,\r\n\r\nThe FBI has received your Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIPA) request and it will be forwarded to Initial Processing for review.   Your request will be processed under the provisions of FOIPA and a response will be mailed to you at a later date.\r\n\r\nRequests for fee waivers and expedited processing will be addressed once your request has been assigned an FOIPA request number. You will receive written notification of the FBI\u2019s decision.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised, beginning Wednesday, March 1, 2017, you will no longer be able to submit FOIPA requests via email.  On this date, FOIPARequest@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:FOIPARequest@ic.fbi.gov> will permanently be taken offline and requests will need to be submitted using the FBI\u2019s electronic FOIPA portal at https://efoia.fbi.gov, after development and testing for two years. With this full implementation, eFOIPA will provide the FBI with an automated process for the receipt and opening of requests, replacing the current manual process and substantially reducing the time it takes to receive and open each electronic request received.  Given the FBI's high volume of requests, this will significantly increase efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terms of service for the site will be modified to allow the uploading of attachments, to remove the limitation on the number of requests received each day by the application, to remove limitation on the number of requests which may be submitted by an individual per day, and increase availability to seven days a week-24 hours a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eFOIPA system will allow requests of all types \u2013 e.g.; Privacy Act, deceased individuals, policies/procedures, events, organizations, etc.  Requesters will:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022    Receive digital confirmation directly on their email account.\r\n\r\n\u2022    No longer have to wait for responses to be received using standard mail.\r\n\r\n\u2022    View transmitted responses and releases from the convenience of their smart phone or tablet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s eFOIPA portal was designed and developed to be the FBI\u2019s primary means for receiving FOIA and Privacy Act requests.\r\n\r\nShould you have questions about preparing or submitting your request using this new service, you may email foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov> or contact the Public Information Officer directly at 540-868-4593.  Alternatively, you may submit your request using fax or standard mail.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding the FOIPA is available at http://www.fbi.gov<http://www.fbi.gov>/ or http://www.fbi.gov/foia/<http://www.fbi.goiv/foia/>.  If you require additional assistance please contact the Public Information Officer.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeanna Ramsey\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) FBI-Records Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4593\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391/4997\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nPLEASE REPLY DIRECTLY TO FOIPAREQUEST@IC.FBI.GOV\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request to place it in a smaller, potentially faster processing track?\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if this is something you would be interested in further discussing. If you chose to narrow the scope of your request, you will be able to request remaining material via a new FOIPA request submission at the completion of this request, subject to applicable fees.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<http://www.fbi.gov/foia> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D9056A.3F022E00][cid:image002.png@01D9056A.3F022E00]\n",

        "communication": "Thank you for your inquiry regarding the status of your Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIPA) request.   A review of your request has determined the following.\r\n\r\nYour request is being preprocessed to another open request on the same subject, meaning a request on the same subject had been received and was already in process prior to receipt of your request.  To avoid duplicative efforts, you will receive the same releases at the same time as the original requester for this subject.  The request to which yours will be preprocessed is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Interim releases are generally made for complex requests.\r\n\r\nYou have the opportunity to reduce the scope of your request; this will accelerate the process and could potentially place your request in a quicker processing queue.  This may also allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  The FBI uses a multi-track processing system to fairly assign and process new requests.  Simple track cases (50 pages or less) usually require the least time to process.  The request to which yours will be preprocessed is considered a complex case in our large track.  Please advise us in writing if you would like to discuss reducing the scope of your request.\r\n\r\nPlease contact foipaquestions@fbi.gov if you require further assistance.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process? Visit us at http://www.fbi.gov/foia\r\n\r\nPlease check the status of your request online at https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps    Status updates are performed on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nNote:  This is a non-emergency email address.  If this is an emergency, please call 911 directly.  If you need to report a tip for immediate action, please contact FBI Tips at http://tips.fbi.gov/ or reach out to your local field office.\n",

Gotbaum (September 5, 1921 - April 5, 2015). Proof of death is not required as his death was widely reported: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/nyregion/victor-gotbaum-labor-leader-who-helped-save-new-york-from-bankruptcy-dies-at-93.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and correspondence responsive to Mr. William Weyland Turner, aka William W. Turner, aka William Turner, aka Bill Turner (April 14, 1927 \u2013 December 26, 2015). Mr. Turner worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation between the years of 1951 and 1961, and wrote about his time as an agent in a number of non-fiction books, including \"Hoover's FBI\", and as an editor for Ramparts Magazine (100-HQ-445393). In the introduction to \"Hoover's FBI\", Mr. Turner states that the Bureau maintained a case file on him which he obtained in the late 1970s, circa 1978; from pages xvii and xviii of the 1993 edition of the book (ISBN-13: 9781560250630): \"When I obtained my FBI file under the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) a decade later, the FBI's back-door collaboration with Joe Pyne was confirmed. Several days before the show, Pyne's producer had called the local FBI office soliciting 'any information on Turner' because there were 'some derogatory comments concerning the FBI' in the book. The Special Agent in Charge (SAC) immediately sent an 'Urgent' teletype to Washington headquarters urging that Pyne be furnished an abstract of my dossier. If this wasn't done, the SAC warned, 'IT MAY WRONGLY APPEAR THAT TURNER AND HIS ILK ARE PARAGONS OF TRUTH, VERACITY AND COMPETENCY TO JUDGE.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Turner's privacy, as he passed away on December 26, 2015. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Turner's obituary in The Mercury News, out of San Jose, California. For clarity's sake, I am including a link here: https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/01/06/william-turner-bay-area-fbi-agent-who-criticized-j-edgar-hoover-dies-at-88/\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mr. Turner publicly disclosed his work with the the Bureau in this memoir and in articles for publications like Ramparts Magazine and The Nation, removing any further concerns over privacy. That he wrote extensively about his time as an agent with the Bureau would make him a figure of public interest.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and Philly Voice, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to Bureau policies on monitoring former agents. Mr. Turner engaged in a very public dispute with then-director J. Edgar Hoover after his termination in 1961, and given that Mr. Turner himself identified a Bureau file or files showing Bureau surveillance, it would be in the public interest for any Bureau files germane to Mr. Turner to be made public so that this era in the Bureau's history can be better understood and contextualized.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.]\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to Bureau policies on monitoring former agents. Mr. Turner engaged in a very public dispute with then-director J. Edgar Hoover after his termination in 1961 and given that Mr. Turner himself identified a Bureau file or files showing Bureau surveillance, it would be in the public interest for any Bureau files germane to Mr. Turner to be made public so that this era in the Bureau's history can be better understood and contextualized.\r\n\r\nThank you for the processing of the original request, and for records already received. I appreciate the work that the FBI's Information Management Division does in processing FOIPA requests and disseminating eligible material.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Please clarify if you are seeking records released in response to these requests, or just the communication responding to the request, without the records that were provided in response to the request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis clarification is necessary because, as a school district,  many of our requests are made by parents or legal representatives of students requesting email records that discuss students and students\u2019 education.  Student records are protected under RCW 42.56.230 and the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).  Redacting these records in order to release them to you will take a considerable amount of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same holds true for public record requests made by staff members for records, which would be released largely unredacted to the staff member but would require considerable redactions prior to releasing them to anyone else.  Our Collective Bargaining Agreements also require notification require prior to releasing records that discuss staff, even in a redacted state. We would like to provide the records you are seeking as quickly and efficiently as possible but would like to avoid additional time-intensive work if you are not seeking those records.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our office follows the record retention schedules established by the Washington Secretary of State, we will not be able to provide records dating back to 2010. We will work with our technology staff to retrieve electronic records dating back to June 30, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act, chapter 42.56 RCW, and more specifically RCW 42.56.520 recognizes that additional time to respond to a request is allowed when needed to clarify the intent of the request, to determine if any of the information requested is exempt, to notify third parties affected by the request, or to locate and assemble the information requested.  Given the nature of the request, that is the case here.  The District anticipates being able to release records on or before January 4, 2022.  The sooner you respond to our request for clarification, the sooner we will be able to begin work on your request.  Please let us know if you are no longer seeking records to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org",

Thank you for the clarification email you sent on November 12, 2021.  We have compiled records beginning with the date of your request and working backward to June 30, 2017, which is the extent of the District's email retention date.  Once we have released records to you that do not need additional redactions, we will begin to re-process the records that need additional redactions starting from November 4, 2021 and working backwards to June 30, 2017.\r\n\r\nPlease note, this request will take a substantial amount of time to redact records that were previously released to parents, which contain their students' education records, or staff members' who have requested their own records, etc.  Please let me know if you are only requesting records that do not require additional redactions.\r\n\r\nThe District has compiled the first installment of responsive records to this request.  The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a disc for you.  The charge for the records is $2.00.  The disc may be picked up at the cashier's desk on the second floor of the Administration building - at which time the disc will be release to you.  Or, if you prefer, you may make a check or money order payable to Spokane Public Schools in the amount of $3.70, which includes the cost of the envelope and postage.  Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested disc will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201<https://maps.google.com/?q=200+North+Bernard+Street,+Spokane,+WA+99201&entry=gmail&source=g> Attn: Public Records Office.  Please note the District office will be closed January 17, 2022.\r\n\r\nPlease note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor.  The Legend of Color Coded Redactions will contain the specifics on the redactions in each installment released to the requestors.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before March 4, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org<mailto:CheriS@SpokaneSchools.org>",

Thank you for the clarification email you sent on November 12, 2021.  We have compiled records beginning with the date of your request and working backward to June 30, 2017, which is the extent of the District's email retention date.  Once we have released records to you that do not need additional redactions, we will begin to re-process the records that need additional redactions starting from November 4, 2021 and working backwards to June 30, 2017.\r\n\r\nPlease note, this request will take a substantial amount of time to redact records that were previously released to parents, which contain their students' education records, or staff members' who have requested their own records, etc.  Please let me know if you are only requesting records that do not require additional redactions.\r\n\r\nThe District has compiled the first installment of responsive records to this request.  The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a disc for you.  The charge for mailing the records to you is $1.70. Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested disc will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201<https://maps.google.com/?q=200+North+Bernard+Street,+Spokane,+WA+99201&entry=gmail&source=g> Attn: Public Records Office.\r\n\r\nPlease note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor.  The Legend of Color Coded Redactions will contain the specifics on the redactions in each installment released to the requestors.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before June 3, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org",

Thank you for the clarification email you sent on November 12, 2021.  We have compiled records beginning with the date of your request and working backward to June 30, 2017, which is the extent of the District's email retention date.  Once we have released records to you that do not need additional redactions, we will begin to re-process the records that need additional redactions starting from November 4, 2021 and working backwards to June 30, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe District has compiled another installment of responsive records to this request.  The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a thumb drive for you. If you would like the records, the cost is $7.21 to include the cost of the thumb drive, envelope and postage.  Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested records will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201<https://maps.google.com/?q=200+North+Bernard+Street,+Spokane,+WA+99201&entry=gmail&source=g> Attn: Public Records Office.\r\n\r\nPlease note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor.  The Legend of Color Coded Redactions will contain the specifics on the redactions in each installment released to the requestors.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before November 23, 2022. Please let me know if you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org<mailto:CheriS@SpokaneSchools.org>",

For example, records which were previously provided to parents or employees that contain exempt information would need additional review and redaction prior to releasing these records to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease clarify within 30 days whether you are, in fact, seeking those records which will require additional review and redaction. If we do not receive clarification from you within 30 days, we will assume you are not seeking those records which require additional redaction.\r\n\r\nThe District has compiled another installment of responsive records to this request.  The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a thumb drive for you. If you would like the records, the cost is $7.21 to include the cost of the thumb drive, envelope and postage.  Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested records will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201<https://maps.google.com/?q=200+North+Bernard+Street,+Spokane,+WA+99201&entry=gmail&source=g> Attn: Public Records Office.\r\n\r\nPlease note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor.  The Legend of Color Coded Redactions will contain the specifics on the redactions in each installment released to the requestors.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before December 22, 2022. Please let me know if you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org<mailto:CheriS@SpokaneSchools.org>",

The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a thumb drive for you. No redactions have been applied, so a withholding index is not included.\r\n\r\nIf you would like the records, the cost is $7.45 to include the cost of the thumb drive, envelope and postage. Once payment has been received, the thumb drive will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201, Attn: Public Records Office.\r\n\r\nPlease also note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before July 14, 2023, due to the records needing additional review, redactions and/or third party notification prior to releasing the records to your organization.

We now understand why our past installments were being sent back to us \"return to sender\".  In the future, please direct any communications regarding your request either directly to me, or to District representative Terri LeFors.  I have included Terri on this communication to ensure you have her email address moving forward.  If you do feel the need to continue to send communications regarding your public records request via U.S. Mail, please ensure that any mailings contain language directing the email directly to Terri (i.e., \"attn: Terri LeFors\") rather than the District in general.\r\n\r\nYour past communication went to the District's billing department, who does not handle the processing of public records requests.  Thus, any communications you send to the District in general (or to the billing department specifically) may not be received by the District's public records department.  In the meantime, we will resend your previous installments to you at your newly-provided address.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, we believe it may take us a few more days than originally anticipated to provide you with the next installment.

The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a thumb drive for you. If you would like the records, the cost is $11.61 to include the cost of the thumb drive, envelope and postage. Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested records will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201<https://maps.google.com/?q=200+North+Bernard+Street,+Spokane,+WA+99201&entry=gmail&source=g> Attn: Public Records Office.\r\n\r\nPlease note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor. The Legend of Color Coded Redactions will contain the specifics on the redactions in each installment released to the requestors.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before November 17, 2023.

The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a thumb drive for you. If you would like the records, the cost is $7.83 to include the cost of the thumb drive, envelope and postage. Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested records will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201<https://maps.google.com/?q=200+North+Bernard+Street,+Spokane,+WA+99201&entry=gmail&source=g> Attn: Public Records Office.\r\n\r\nPlease note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor.

They are being provided to you pursuant to RCW 42.56 et seq.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

        "communication": "Good Morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning file number 72-HQ-2190.  The FBI located approximately 1,374 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size.\r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  The current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 57 months.\r\n\r\nGiven the current COVID-19 pandemic and federal guidelines to mitigate the spread of the virus, the FBI's Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) is operating with limited staff on a staggered schedule to protect the safety of its employees, families and communities.  As a result, estimated dates of completion for Freedom of Information Act requests were impacted and you can expect lengthened response timelines.  Please note that these are estimates, and these timelines may change as this national emergency evolves.  The FBI remains committed to fulfilling your FOIPA request in the timeliest manner possible.   Thank you for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of all tracks and the average time approximately to complete each.  Hopefully this breakdown will be helpful to you in reducing the scope of this request.\r\nSimple track request (0- 50 pages) current average time is approximately 4 months to complete.\r\nMedium track request (51-950 pages) current average time is approximately 27 months to complete.\r\nLarge track request (951-8000 pages) current average time is approximately 57 months to complete.\r\nX-Large track request (over 8000 pages) current average time is approximately 70 months to complete.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>.

Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please also conduct a search for records at\r\n    the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have\r\n    been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the\r\n    destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating\r\n    to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but\r\n    not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said\r\n    records.

All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the use of body cameras, including:\r\n  a. policies or procedures governing use of body cameras;\r\n  b. what types of data are obtained;\r\n  c. the conditions under which body cameras are used;\r\n  d. the frequency of body camera use;\r\n  e. the number of body camera units or systems acquired;\r\n  f. the number of officers equipped with body cameras;\r\n\r\n2. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the review of body camera data by supervising officers or staff or civilian review personnel to ensure officer compliance with department or agency policies and applicable state and federal law;\r\n\r\n3. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the storage of data obtained using body cameras, including:\r\n  a. where the data is stored;\r\n  b. how long data is stored;\r\n  c. when data must be discarded; and\r\n  d. how much data your agency or department currently stores;\r\n\r\n4. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning access to body camera data, including:\r\n  a. the legal justification required before a law enforcement employee or member of the public may access body camera data;\r\n  b. purposes for which the data may be accessed;\r\n  c. purposes for which the data may not be accessed;\r\n  d. who may access the data, what procedures they must go through to obtain access, and who must authorize access; and\r\n  e. the existence of a system that records who accesses the data and when the data is accessed;\r\n\r\n5. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the sharing of data obtained through body cameras, including:\r\n  a. what type of data is shared;\r\n  b. what databases your agency puts collected body camera data into; and\r\n  c. third parties, governmental or private, that may access your agency's body camera data, including what procedures a third party must go through to access the data and any restrictions placed on a third party regarding further sharing of your body camera data;\r\n\r\n6. All agreements to share body camera data with outside agencies or departments, corporations, or other entities; and\r\n\r\n7. All training materials used to instruct members of your department or agency in body camera deployment, data management, or operation of automated records systems that contain body camera data to which any member of your department or agency has access, including regional or shared databases.\r\n\r\nIf this records request is denied in whole or in part, please provide (1) whether the documents in question exists, and if so, (2) the statutory exemption you are claiming prevents their release. If the Police Department claims an exemption for some of the requested documents, please produce those for which it does not claim an exemption, including records where the exempt portions are redacted. \r\n\r\nBecause the requested documents will be made available to the general public, this request is not being made for commercial purposes, and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest, I am requesting a waiver of any fees for searching or copying these records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. If possible, I prefer that the records be produced in electronic format.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBlake Feldman",
