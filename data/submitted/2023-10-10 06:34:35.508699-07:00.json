The PRA provides for the inspection or copying of existing identifiable public records; it does not compel the City to respond directly to questions or create new records, lists, or reports in response to a request.\r\n\r\nDue to the anticipated significant volume of emails from 1/1/2022 to 10/9/2023, we are wondering whether you might be able to narrow your request somewhat to the particular topic or topics you are interested in.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nBrenna Nurmi, CMC, CPMC | City of San Rafael\r\nDEPUTY CITY CLERK\r\n1400 Fifth Avenue, Room 209\r\nSan Rafael, CA 94901\r\nOffice:  415.485.3066<tel:(415)%20485-3066>\r\n\r\n[Logo on White]",
