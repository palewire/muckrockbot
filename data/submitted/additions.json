For example, the Superintendent receives over $635,000 in pay (accoring to 2023 records) but some 47% of that is paid from the VMI Alumni Agencies. Therefore this request is for any additional funds received and their sources. Under Virginia State Law VMI and the Board of Visitors are required to report all such outside funds, so this disclosure cannot redact the names of source individuals or organizations, agencies, etc. by masking them as \"private funds\", \"other funds\", etc.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request be filled electronically, by either e-mail attachment or FTP Download ifavailable, otherwise sent through mail via CD/DVD.
