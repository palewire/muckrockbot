Critically, that order must itself appear in the record, to maintain transparency about what was excluded and why.\r\n\r\nIn his appearance before the Court, Lloyd Painter testified he witnessed the deliberate machine-gunning of life rafts we had dropped over the side in anticipation of abandoning ship. This FOIA request includes his sworn statement as an attachment.\r\n\r\nAccording to CINCUSNAVEUR 181105Z JUN67 USS Liberty crewmen testified before the Court they thought the attack was deliberate. CINCUSNAVEUR 181105Z JUN67 is included as an attachment to this FOIA request.\r\n\r\nNowhere in the US Navy Court of Inquiry Report released to the public does Lloyd Painter\u2019s testimony or the crew testimony referenced above appear. \r\n\r\nNor does the authorization from the convening authority authorizing the removal of the testimony appear.\r\n\r\nWe request you release to us a copy of the order from the Convening Authority authorizing the removal of testimony given before the US Navy Court of Inquiry into the attack on the USS Liberty, including but not limited to Lloyd Painter\u2019s testimony of his witnessing the deliberate machine gunning of life rafts we had dropped over the side in anticipation of abandoning ship and authorizing the removal of USS Liberty survivor testimony that they thought the attack was deliberate.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\npreviously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching\r\nover 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard,\r\nProperty of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such,\r\nas I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing\r\nskills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files\r\nonline and make them available through non-profits such as the library\r\nInternet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to\r\na large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of\r\nit, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government\r\nitself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\nthis particular subject in advance. Further, case law states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of\r\nthe ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section\r\nof the public is not required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 365\r\nF.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\nbecause it also had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publish a number of . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdocument\r\nsets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under\r\nthis criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally,\r\ncourts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the\r\nrequester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made\r\nby\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a representative of the news media. Id. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A\r\nnewspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media\r\nregardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is\r\nrequesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot\r\nfor the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\nFee20category20and20search20parameters.pdf\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern: Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby\r\nrequest the following records: Records from, mentioning or generated as a\r\nresult of FBI file SA-3525850.

According to news reports, he had been detailed to multiple agencies in the service of DOGE's activities.
