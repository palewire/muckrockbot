I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nWe are currently looking for any responsive records and at this time I estimate that it will take approximately thirty to sixty days to prepare records located that are responsive parts 1 and 2 of your request.\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer.  Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  I am seeking clarification on this portion of the request.  If you can narrow your requested records types, be more specific to the types of records for which you are seeking or provide additional search terms this may reduce the estimate of time. Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated I estimate that it will take, at a minimum, one year to produce the records.\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the first installment will be available in approximately one month. I will contact you on or about March 5, 2020 regarding the status of your request.\r\nSincerely,\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D5DC3A.5D218770]\r\nJoey Christine Grant\r\nPublic Records Manager\r\nEmail: jgrant@tacoma.k12.wa.us<mailto:jgrant@tacoma.k12.wa.us>\n",

I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the fourth installment which includes records responsive to number two by following this link: https://app.box.com/s/chcz6vh9sdpjb840tw7l2cbq8wsl9k6z This link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by July 18, 2020, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me. All redactions are due to personal privacy RCW 42.56.230 (3).\r\n\r\nThis installment completes part one and two of your request.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer.  Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  I am seeking clarification on this portion of the request.  If you can narrow your requested records types, be more specific to the types of records for which you are seeking or provide additional search terms this may reduce the estimate of time. Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated I estimate that it will take, at a minimum, one year to produce the records.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month. I will contact you on or about July 18, 2020 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosures:       Bates Numbers 005952-007524\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D3ECFB.30F42750]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the eighth installment which includes records responsive to number three by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/shared/static/co1df7tx97rzyjpgiri4iai9ihlrmxqh.pdf  This link will be deactivated in 30 days.\r\nIf you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by November 2, 2020, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions, however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Therefore, we have chosen to notify you within the previous letters. If we find more than one exemption type in future installments, we will create a log noting these exemptions.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer.  Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  I am seeking clarification on this portion of the request. Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated I estimate that it will take, at a minimum, one year to produce the records.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month. I will contact you on or about October 3, 2020 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 009020-009786\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D3ECFB.30F42750]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the tenth installment which includes records responsive to number three by following this link: https://app.box.com/s/1ahxwm28uvc8so10961325o75y2u5de4\r\nIf you need any assistance accessing this link, please let me know. This link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by January 11, 2021, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions, however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Therefore, we have chosen to notify you within the previous letters. If we find more than one exemption type in future installments, we will create a log noting these exemptions.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer.  Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  I am seeking clarification on this portion of the request. Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated I estimate that it will take, at a minimum, one year to produce the records.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month. I will contact you on or about January 11, 2021 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 009980-010085\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D3ECFB.30F42750]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nPlease find the thirteenth installment which includes records responsive to number three by following this link: https://app.box.com/s/5yecs57obnqxwfwors7v7q01tj10nlqz\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by April 11, 2021, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the thirteenth installment, there is an exemption log noting another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately two weeks, on March 25, 2021. I will contact you on or about March 25, 2021 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 010470-010794\r\n                       2021 03 11 Exemption Log PRR 2020-00019\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D71685.A8B6E960]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nPlease find the seventeenth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/054snktthcad2ezmlmkp6ov3qke3jzmh\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by June 14, 2021, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the thirteenth and fourteenth installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the fifteenth or sixteenth installments and there are no exemptions for this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately two weeks, on May 28, 2021. I will contact you on or about May 28, 2021 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 014595-016691\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D748DB.32399070]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nPlease find the seventeenth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/idpk70nsxd7cnpjb3ztz5wsinvfpwq0s\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by August 30, 2021, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the thirteenth and fourteenth installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth installments, nineteenth and there are no exemptions for this current installment.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, August 30, 2021.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nPlease find the twenty-third installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/9p99aiernbwei2e5dol5lyykxpnxii3b\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by December 12, 2021, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with this installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, December 12, 2021. I will contact you on or about December 12, 2021 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 030944-032800\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D7D7AF.CEA7EFC0]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the twenty-fourth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/i83bf4xjifnjw4ly51h5uesxhwur2yh5\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by March 24, 2022, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, March 24, 2022. I will contact you on or about March 24, 2022 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 036997-038780\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D82986.6871BAF0]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, June 23, 2022. I will contact you on or about June 23, 2022 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 042356-044177\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D86EB4.7F46BAA0]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the thirtieth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/joyiwum69mmen1ehyi4jw2fv803xmy0x\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by July 23, 2022, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request.

We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the thirty-third installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/shared/static/ep59nxs44yx4rhsxs10rmk8zl91bbzgo.pdf\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by October 22, 2022, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, October 22, 2022. I will contact you on or about October 22, 2022 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 049938-052060\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D8CE96.8BA2FB00]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the thirty-fifth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/ur86dn1ccotgwiutcpgssinkfhb19ubx\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by January 9, 2023, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 34th or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, 9, 2023. I will contact you on or about January 9, 2023 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\nBates Numbers 052207-053509\r\nEmployee Discipline and Misconduct Workshop Materials_NOV 2015\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D90BDA.31D66310]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 34th, 35th, 36th or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments. I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, April 17, 2023. I will contact you on or about April 17, 2023, regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:\r\nBates Numbers 055710-056112\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSusan R.

All of the determinations extended the time to respond to my request.\r\n\r\nOOM has constructively denied my request. The repeated delays, which have now extended nearly 10 months after I submitted the request on April 26, 2022, are unreasonable given the narrow scope of the request.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, OOM is required by law to provide specific reasons within 10 business days explaining why this request cannot be fulfilled in a timely manner, or else, must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by the specific date given beyond 20 business days, or if the specific date given is unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied (see \u00a789[4][a]). In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you either fulfill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial, as required by law, of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\n\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\n\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\n\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKayla Fox",

If any potentially responsive records have\r\n    been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the\r\n    destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating\r\n    to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but\r\n    not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said\r\n    records. If previously released records are available, then I request a\r\n    rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are\r\n    located and processed for release.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

However, the continuous extensions for this specific request, which has now extended over two months, appear to be unduly excessive and go against the spirit of the legislation.\r\n\r\nTo recap, my request pertains to the provision of all the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022. It is disconcerting that this has led to such significant delays, and this pattern of delay suggests an unwillingness to comply with the law. As a concerned citizen and in the interest of public transparency, I am unable to accept these repeated postponements.\r\n\r\nPlease understand the gravity of this situation. The requested documents will be made available to the general public and this non-commercial request contributes to an open and transparent discourse about our educational systems' approach to teaching the Holocaust. This is not a matter to be taken lightly or delayed further.\r\n\r\nAs such, I urge the North Colonie Central School District to expedite the provision of the requested information without further delay. I trust that your team can manage this request as a matter of priority, in respect of the provisions set by the New York Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\nIf there are extenuating circumstances that have not been disclosed leading to these delays, please communicate these at your earliest convenience. My aim is to ensure due process, and I am willing to work with you to find a mutually agreeable resolution, as long as the urgency and importance of this request are respected.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation. I look forward to receiving the requested documents soon.\r\n\r\n",

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.

Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools. \r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and, \r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b). \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlisha Patel",

The operation aimed to neutralize Japanese forces, capture strategic islands, and provide a platform for the launching of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers towards Japan.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nOfficial military reports, planning documents, and after-action reviews related to Operation Forager.\r\nCommunications, memos, or letters involving military commanders and personnel discussing the planning, execution, and aftermath of Operation Forager.\r\nAny photographs, maps, or other visual materials produced or collected during the operation.\r\nRecords of any investigations, inquiries, or tribunals associated with Operation Forager.\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was received by the Reference Branch (RR2RR) on May 25,\r\n2023 with the assigned tracking number 23-44134.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have searched our holdings in Record Group 24: Records of the Bureau of\r\nNaval Personnel, Record Group 38: Records of the Chief of Naval Operations,\r\nRecord Group 127: Records of the US Marine Corps, Record Group 313: Records\r\nof Naval Operating Forces, and Record Group 407: Records of the Adjutant\r\nGeneral\u2019s Office and we were able to find relevant records for Operation\r\nForager for the Invasion of the Marianas, but we were not able to locate\r\nOperation Forager records for the invasion of the Palaus because they were\r\nunder a different operational designation \u2013 Operation Stalemate II in\r\nsupport of the Invasion of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to both Operation Forager and Stalemate II have\r\ndeclassified and are open and available to the public and they do not\r\nrequire a Freedom of Information Act request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn RG 24, there are series relating to casualty files in Entries A1 3:\r\nWorld War II Casualty Reports and A1 1024: Casualty Information Reports\r\n[Ships, Stations, Units, and Incidents Casualty] arranged by ship or\r\nsquadron designation.  In Entry P 118-A1 and P 118-A2 are the deck logs of\r\ncommissioned US naval vessels during World War II arranged by the name or\r\nhull designation (if unnamed).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn RG 38, there are several series that might interest you including World\r\nWar II Action Reports and Other Operational Records (Entry A1 351), World\r\nWar II Operational Orders and Plans (Entry A1 352), and World War II War\r\nDiaries (Entry A1 353).  These series are arranged by naval hierarchy.\r\nThere are also the World War II Command Files (Entry UD-09D 19), and\r\nRecords of the Japanese Navy (UD-09D 23), and Records of the War Plans\r\nDivision (Entry A1 355).  The WWII Command Files has a broad selection of\r\nrecords arranged by naval hierarchy but unlike the Action Reports or War\r\nDiaries, these records are more subject files with different kinds of\r\nrecords from naval commands. The latter two entries have Staff Studies and\r\nfeasibility plans for the invasions of the different islands of the\r\nMarianas and the Palaus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the materials you are looking for may be available on the National\r\nArchives Catalog in a digitized series of select World War II War Diaries\r\nand Other Operational Reports - https://catalog.archives.gov/id/4697018.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn RG 127, the primary series of interest would be Entry A1 1051: US Marine\r\nCorps World War II Operational Files (a. k. a. USMC Geographic Files),\r\nwhich are arranged by campaign, in which there are separate files for\r\nPeleliu, Guam, and Saipan-Tinian.Under each campaign, they are arranged by\r\nMarine Corps hierarchy including US Navy Amphibious Force records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn RG 313, there are several series for \u201cFlag Commands\u201d of the US Navy\r\nincluding Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, 3rd/5th Fleets, 3rd/5th\r\nAmphibious Force and Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet.  These files are\r\nadministrative records and arranged by the Navy Filing Manual -\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/research/military/filing-manuals#navy The\r\nmaterials in RG 313 are more likely to include any files relating to Courts\r\nof Inquiry and Boards of Investigation (depending on who held the courts\r\nand boards) under their administrative files under filing designations\r\nA17-24 and A17-25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn RG 407, there is the US Army World War II Unit Operational Records,\r\nwhich are arranged by US Army command in Entry NM-3 427.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are forwarding your request to the Still Photographs Branch for any\r\nphotographs that they may have regarding your topic.  They will send you a\r\nseparate response to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are forwarding your request to the Cartographic Branch for any maps and\r\ncharts that they may have regarding your topic.  They will send you a\r\nseparate response to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause these records are declassified and open and available to the public\r\nand also numerous in quantity, we would recommend that you or a researcher\r\nworking on your behalf visit our facility to review these records in\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords in our custody contain a number of files that include information\r\non your topic.

        "communication": "Good afternoon. Please be aware that with respect to your request for records concerning \"youth correctional facilities\" and \"juvenile detention facilities\", CYFD operates secure facilities for adjudicated youth only. Juvenile detention facilities are managed by the county and local governments, and there are currently four in operation in New Mexico: the Bernalillo County Youth Services Center (https://www.bernco.gov/youth-services-center/); the Dona Ana County Juvenile Detention Center (https://www.donaanacounty.org/departments/law-safety/detention-center?locale=en); the San Juan County Juvenile Detention Center (https://www.sjcounty.net/government/juvenile-services); and the Lea County Juvenile Detention Center (https://www.leacounty.net/p/departments/law-and-safety/detention-center).\r\n\r\nWith respect to your first question, Ruth Medina and Jenna Heller are our charge nurses at the J Paul Taylor and Youth Development Diagnostic Centers respectively; and Ralph Espinoza is deputy director for behavioral health at the centers. Ralph is out through the end of June; Ronnie Garcia is acting. Contact information for the facilities is available online at https://www.cyfd.nm.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Telephone_Directory_November_2022.pdf.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your second question, these are available online. Links to individual documents are found below this response.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your third question, our contracts for services are currently under review by legal counsel. This is a broad and burdensome request, and we require additional time to complete it (NMSA 1978 \u00a714-2-10). You may expect to hear from me on our progress by or before July 14, 2023.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your fourth question, the Medicaid and Medicare state agency for New Mexico is the Human Services Department. To submit a records request to HSD, please visit https://www.hsd.state.nm.us/public-information-and-communications/ipra-requests/. I have copied them on this response, and I recommend submitting a request directly.\r\n\r\nFinally, with response to your fifth question, I am not entirely clear what you are seeking. The appropriation of state general funds for the Department is found in the annual General Appropriation Act (commonly called House Bill 2) (for FY2023, available online here https://nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?chamber=H&legType=B&legNo=2&year=22; for FY2024, available online here https://nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?chamber=H&legType=B&legNo=2&year=23). If you could please provide additional information as to what you're looking for, that would be of great assistance.\r\nRules/Regulations\r\nChapter 14 Juvenile Justice\r\n\r\n8.14.1 Protective

This request pertains to communications, reports, plans, documentations, calendar entries, or agreements between the district and BOCES and or third parties regarding school climate surveys (i.e. EDSCLS) for the previous five years.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand that certain requests might require time to process, I find it troubling that more than two months have elapsed without a satisfactory resolution. Even more troubling is the continuous extension of the \"anticipated completion date\", with the latest one set for June 16, 2023.\r\n\r\nGiven the importance of transparency and accountability in public service, I am deeply dismayed by the persistent delay and lack of responsiveness. The documents in question should be readily accessible, and I see no reasonable explanation for such a protracted delay.\r\n\r\nUnder the New York Freedom of Information Law, public bodies are obligated to respond to requests for public records in a timely manner. The continued postponement is contrary to the principles of this law and diminishes the faith in our public institutions' ability to uphold these basic standards of transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I expect this situation to be rectified without further delay, honoring the principles of transparency and accountability that underpin the Freedom of Information Law.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools. \r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and, \r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b). \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlisha Patel",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\nI was forwarded your records request and I am attaching three files responsive to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The spreadsheet is a list of arrests, criminal complaints/summons and citations regarding persons under 21 that occurred at addresses for Andover Public Schools and Greater Lawrence Technical School. Our records management systems do not currently track if the persons involved were students, or any disability status. Further, many of these actions may simply be motor vehicle stops that did not directly occur on school grounds but on the roadway alongside it. I could not limit searches to school grounds so I could only do based on address. The individuals aged under 21 is also not proof that someone is a student, but I am including them as potentials search matches. This data should go back to July 1, 2018 \u2013 we don\u2019t track by school year. We migrated to a new system in November 2021, so information prior to that is less complete than after.\r\n3.   While the data extract shows one arrest in February 2019, I can see that it was a motor vehicle stop on River Rd does not appear related to schools. In my opinion, arrests would be zero for the time periods referenced.\r\n5.   We do not track by school year but the extract has the dates.\r\n6. I am attaching two Memorandum of Understandings.\r\n7 and 8 \u2013 I could no immediately find records responsive to these portions of the request.\r\n\nMike Kirk<mailto:mike.kirk@andoverma.us>\r\nPublic Safety Application Architect / Records Supervisor\r\nAndover Police Department\r\n32 North Main Street\r\nAndover, MA 01810\r\n(P) 978-623-3521",

Any policy, guidance, handbook, manual, or standard contract concerning the institution\u2019s interactions or relationship with members of the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\n2. Any policy, guidance, handbook, or manual concerning the interactions or communications of institutional employees, including faculty, administrators, staff, and student employees, with the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools. \r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and, \r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b). \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlisha Patel",

        "communication": "Good morning, Kimberly, \r\n\r\nHere is the City of Atlanta\u2019s publicly posted retention schedule for official records, including those maintained by the Executive Office: https://www.atlantaga.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/45144/637183212443630000#page9\r\n\r\nOn page 11, 06-RS-05B, requires preservation of records relating to Open records for 3 years. This means: \u201cInquiries from members of the public and/or other government officials requesting access to information under the Georgia Open Records Act.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s unclear to me how the Executive Office is able to ensure compliance with the Retention Schedule currently posted on the Transparency Office\u2019s website, which requires retention of Open Records request correspondence for 3 years, if you maintain no comprehensive list of requests received and responded to. So I checked out the City\u2019s Records Management policy, also posted to the Transparency Office\u2019s website, as required by City Ordinance. That policy is available here: https://www.atlantaga.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/45146/637183212457570000#page9 \r\n\r\nSection 5 of the Records Management Policy says: \u201cAll Department Heads shall cause to be created and preserved, records containing adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures and essential transactions of their respective departments.\u201d \r\n\r\nTo accomplish the Records Management policy, Atlanta Departments, including the Executive Office, must appoint a Records Officer, pursuant to Section 6:  https://www.atlantaga.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/45146/637183212457570000#page9. That Records Officer is required to \u201ccreate/update an annual inventory of the department/unit\u2019s records.\u201d \r\n\r\nBecause the Retention Schedule requires Atlanta departments/units (including the Executive Office) to retain Open Records Requests, and because the Records Management Policy records the Records Officer to create and update an inventory of the records that must be retained, the Executive Office would be in violation of the City\u2019s own policies if the first answer you provided is true\u2014i.e., that there is no log of Open Records Requests received and responded to by the Executive Office.\r\n\r\nYou previously informed me, \u201cthe executive office responds to open records requests in accordance with the Georgia Open Records Act.\u201d You pointedly avoided representing that the Executive Office is in compliance with municipal law. So now\u2019s your chance to do that. \r\n\r\nThe City of Atlanta\u2019s Retention Schedule requires the Executive Office to preserve public records request correspondence for 3 years. The City of Atlanta\u2019s Records Management Policy requires the Records Officer to create and update an inventory of the records that must be preserved under the Retention Schedule. So the City of Atlanta\u2019s records policies, promulgated in accordance with Municipal Ordinance. \r\n\r\nCan you please confirm that the Executive Office is out of compliance with the Records Management Policy\u2019s Inventory requirement for Open Records Requests? \r\n\r\nThank you very much! \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\nIs the Executive Office out of compliance with Atlanta municipal law and the City\u2019s own Records Management Policy and Retention Schedule? \r\n",

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\n\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\n\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\n\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKayla Fox",

Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request.  You request the following information:\r\n\r\nI am requesting images and video recorded in drone flyovers of prescribed burns in \"USGS (Wetland Aquatic Research Center)\" and \"USGS Wetland Aquatic Research Center Lafayette LA\" on January 26, 2023.\r\n\r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the \u201cnews media\u201d requester.  As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.49(a)(1).  You can expect to hear from us promptly regarding the outcome of this search.\r\n\r\nYou have agreed to pay up to $200.00 for the processing of your request.  If we find that this will not cover the cost of processing your request, we will stop processing your request at the point this amount has been reached and will let you know before we incur additional charges.  You can then either agree to pay the additional amount needed or narrow the scope of your request.\r\n\r\nWe use Multitrack Processing to process FOIA requests.  The Simple track is for requests that would generally take one to five workdays to process.  The Normal track is for requests that would generally take six to twenty workdays to process.  The Complex track is for requests that would generally take twenty-one to sixty workdays to process.  The Extraordinary track is for requests that would generally take more than sixty workdays to process.  The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing, which are processed as soon as practicable.  Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the Normal processing track.  There are 15 requests pending ahead of yours in our overall processing queue.  Presuming that our current FOIA capacity and burden remain constant, we expect that we will dispatch a determination to you by July 10, 2023.\r\n\r\nYou may narrow the scope of your request to obtain quicker processing in your currently-assigned track or move the request into a different track, which may enable us to process it more quickly by communicating with us at foia@usgs.gov.\r\n\r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.  You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:            \r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n\r\n8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS\r\n\r\nCollege Park, MD  20740-6001\r\n\r\nTelephone:  (202) 741-5770\r\n\r\nFax:  (202) 741-5769\r\n\r\nToll-free:  1 (877) 684-6448\r\n\r\nE-mail:  ogis@nara.gov\r\n\r\nWeb: https://www.archives.gov/ogis\r\n\r\nPlease note that using OGIS services does not affect the timing of an appeal with the Department\u2019s FOIA & Privacy Act Appeals Officer. Contact information for the Department\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, who you may also seek dispute resolution services from, is available at https://www.doi.gov/foia/foiacenters.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about your request, you may contact me by email at foia@usgs.gov.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEric J.

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\nJune 13, 2023 Miriam Bhimani \r\nRE: Chicago Public Schools FOIA Request N013588-041923 \r\nDear Miriam Bhimani: This letter is in reply to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking the following information: \r\nFrom Aspen, the CPS Student Information System, please provide the following reports by month from July 1, 2022 to current broken down by race and CPS network: \r\n1. Special Education Students Missing Active Transportation Request - anonymized aggregated students, type of transportation. RESPONSE : The CPS FOIA office has reviewed your request with the CPS Transportation Office and the information you seek is not comprehensively tracked in the manner requested and in the regular course of business and would be considered creating records which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. Specifically, t he requested information is not readily\u00a0available as it is not part of the standard reporting protocols\u00a0related to student transportation. Creating records is not required according to guidance provided by 5 ILCS 140/2(c). 5 ILCS 140/1, Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28, 32 (4 th Dist. 1989), and Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Additionally, under Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Further, section 1 of FOIA states in part: \u201cThis Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\u201d In accordance with Section 1 of the Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer your questions or prepare researched records on your behalf in response to your request. \r\n2. Transportation Active Requests - anonymized aggregated student data by type of transportation (AL, IT, OK, SA, SH, SE, SW, XH, XN). RESPONSE: Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. The data contains all active transportation requests since July 1, 2022 by race, network, and transportation type. This means that requests with missing request dates, or requests that have any other status but active (e.g. pending) are excluded.\u00a0And there are no instances where there are any \u201cITs\u201d during this time period. Also, race is determined by the student's current race as of 6/5/23. And \u201cnetwork\u201d is determined by the network of the school that the request was submitted at. A network of \"--\" usually indicates therapeutic schools, which are not part of a CPS network. Lastly, a network value that is missing means that there was no school code associated with the request. To the extent you consider this a denial, you have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 Fax: 217-782-1396 E-mail: publicaccess@atg.state.il.us You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/11. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Ana Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",
