        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords regarding the Los Angeles  county district attorney's office use of mobile device forensic tools (MDFTs). \r\nThis includes any software, hardware, process, or service that is capable of any of the following:\r\n\u2022 extracting any data from a mobile device,\r\n\u2022 recovering deleted files from a mobile device, or\r\n\u2022 bypassing mobile device passwords, locks, or other security features.\r\nExamples of MDFTs include, but are not limited to, products or services offered by vendors such \r\nas Cellebrite, Grayshift, Oxygen Forensics, BlackBag Technologies, Magnet Forensics, MSAB, \r\nAccessData, Paraben, Katana Forensics, BK Forensics, and Guidance Software/OpenText. \r\nI specifically requests the following records under the California public records act \r\n1. Purchase Records and Agreements: Any and all records reflecting an agreement for purchase, \r\nacquisition, or license of MDFTs, or permission to use, test, or evaluate MDFTs since 2015. \r\n2. Records of Use: Any and all records describing the office use of MDFTs since 2015.\r\na. In particular, we seek records reflecting the office aggregate use of MDFTs. For \r\nexample, monthly reports that reflect the total number of MDFT cases for each month, \r\nbroken down by type of crime, and number and type of phones, and number and type of \r\nother devices.\r\ni. Please specify any instances where the office used Cellebrite Advanced Services, \r\nor otherwise transferred possession of a device or its contents to a vendor for off-site \r\nprocessing, including Regional Computer Forensics Laboratories.\r\nii. Please include any instances of forensic examination of a device (e.g. using JTAG or \r\nchip-off processes) that may not involve a vendor\u2019s product. \r\n3. Policies Governing Use: Any and all records regarding policies and guidelines governing the \r\nuse of MDFTs, including but not limited to: training materials regarding their operation, \r\nrestrictions on when they may be used, limitations on retention and use of collected data, \r\nsecurity measures taken to protect stored and in-transit data, guidance on when a warrant or \r\nother legal process must be obtained, and guidance on when the existence and use of MDFTs \r\nmay be revealed to the public, criminal defendants, or judges.\r\nDue to the ubiquity of mobile devices, law enforcement sees the data stored on mobile devices, \r\nlike cellphones, as key sources of evidence for investigations. However, mobile devices can \r\ncontain large amounts of people\u2019s sensitive and private information, much of which may be \r\nirrelevant to a given investigation. As the Supreme Court recognized in Riley v. \r\nCalifornia, \u201c[o]ne of the most notable distinguishing features of modern cellphones is their \r\nimmense storage capacity.\u201d As such, forensic searches of mobile devices are often highly invasive, \r\nand we believe that such searches by law enforcement are increasingly common. \r\nMobile device forensic tools (MDFTs) are used by law enforcement to extract data from mobile \r\ndevices. In some cases, if the data on the mobile device is encrypted, some MDFTs can help law \r\nenforcement circumvent a device\u2019s security features in order to access otherwise inaccessible \r\ndata. These capabilities have been the subject of broad public debate, for example, in the \r\naftermath of the high-profile San Bernardino shooting in 2015. Whether or not devices are \r\nencrypted, law enforcement\u2019s use of MDFTs is an issue of significant public interest. \r\nCurrently, there is a considerable lack of public information available regarding how local \r\nlaw enforcement agencies use MDFTs, and the policies and procedures that govern such \r\nuse. The public is entitled to understand the office\u2019s activities and capabilities with \r\nrespect to MDFTs, and this request seeks to further the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMr. adonis gaynor",

This strain of influenza was first identified on March 31st of 2013. \r\n\r\nAccording to a Vanity Fair article that discussed the Obama administration's NSC and pandemic planning, the Obama administration was closely following the spread of A(H797) in late 2016. The article implies that the 2016 spread of A(H797) was so worrisome to Susan Rice that she decided to advocate for pandemic planning to be included in an exercise with the incoming Trump administration. \r\n\r\nHere's a link to the Vanity Fair article where the Obama administration's NSC response to H797 is mentioned: https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/05/trump-obama-coronavirus-pandemic-response?srsltid=AfmBOopglhTiQFMeUCKo_euYU2ej58tGguKPy1mDHiYXc_m_-mJ8Ln-B\r\n\r\nThe time frame for this search is from the date of A(H797)'s identification on March 31st of 2013 to the last day of the Obama administration on January 20th of 2017. The majority of documents generated by the NSC would have been in late 2016 after an outbreak among poultry in the United States and during the transition to the Trump administration. \r\n\r\nMore on A(H797) can be found here: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/zoonotic-influenza/facts/faq-H7N9\r\n\r\nThank you for the Obama Presidential Library's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working with you until this request is granted.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

For example, you may find his New York Times obituary at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/us/politics/jimmy-carter-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an associate editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity.
