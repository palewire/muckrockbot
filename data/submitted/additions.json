If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nPlease see the following news publication to serve as proof of death: https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/history/articles/the-purge-chandler-davis\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
