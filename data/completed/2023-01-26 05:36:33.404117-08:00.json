        "communication": "VANCOUVER PUBLIC SCHOOLS DISTRICT \u2013 School Resource Officer Program / School Safety and Security Staff Program / School District Law Enforcement Contracts and Agreements for the Years 2019-2022.\r\n\r\nVia email: publicrecordsrequest@vansd.org\r\n\r\nTo whom it may concern,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON STATE OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION - EQUITY AND CIVIL RIGHTS (https://www.k12.wa.us/policy-funding/equity-and-civil-rights):\r\n\r\n\"The Washington State legislature notes that schools should be a place in which all youth feel safe. With racial equity as a central component of safety and security planning, it is imperative that all school safety and security staff not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.\"\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.\tProvide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3.\tProvide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nNote: If your agency chooses not to produce the requested records in reverse chronological order as requested, and/or chooses to sandbag this request by dribbling out a few records per installment every 6 months (tee-hee), you can expect a separate targeted public records request for each line item by year - submitted via multiple members of the public, multiple times until the requested records are timely produced. This simple three part multi year request would then become twelve (12) separate public records requests. If your agency would prefer 12 separate individual requests, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

        "communication": "Dear Tom Nash:\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS), Division of Child Support Enforcement (DCSE) is responding to your request received on January 19, 2023, made in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requesting the following information.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Does DCSE collect any fees related to servicing the incarcerated youth?\r\n\r\nDCSE is responsible for establishing paternity as well as establishing, modifying, enforcing, and collecting child support obligations. See Va. Code \u00a7 63.2-100 (defining child support services). Prior to July 1, 2021, the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) would apply for child support services when a child was placed in custody. DJJ no longer applies for services on new placements, but DCSE continues to collect arrearages due prior to July 1, 2021. Pursuant to Va. Code \u00a7 63.2-1904, DCSE charges a $35 annual fee on DJJ cases. DCSE deducts that fee from additional child support collections after having first collected and disbursed at least $550 during the federal fiscal year. Fees that we may collect directly from a parent, such as the cost of genetic testing, are the result of our mission as the child support agency and are not related to the services being provided to the justice-involved youth. For a full discussion of child support fees, see Chapter 11, Section 10 of our Program Manual, available to the public at https://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/dcse/program_manual/Program_Manual.pdf.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  All reports, databases, spreadsheets, or equivalent materials regarding debts/restitution paid to or owed to this department or any facility/agency under its jurisdiction in FY2021. Please include all relevant data regarding medical and room & board costs, including the number of youths (i.e., juveniles) charged for medical and room & board costs or fees and the total amount of medical and room & board fees imposed in FY2021.\r\n\r\nDCSE is responsible for the establishment and collection of child support obligations, some of which are payable to DJJ.  Those obligations are set according to the child support guidelines and are unrelated to the costs assessed for care. DCSE does not track medical or room and board costs for justice-involved youth.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nS.

We appreciate your frustration with the delay in our ability to respond to your request, and apologize that we are not able to give you a more precise estimate of when you can expect to receive our response. At this time, our general expectation is that, we will be able to send you a final response in the next three to four\u00a0 months. \n\nPlease understand that our office handles a very large volume of requests \u2013 in one month we respond to more requests on average than most Departments receive in a year.  In addition to handling a large volume of requests, we are also responsible for processing a variety of particularly sensitive types of records.  We have a responsibility to ensure that we carefully review all of the records we process to ensure that we provide maximum transparency while withholding any exempt material that could foreseeably cause harm to a protected interest.  This is a labor intensive task that involves working with offices to ensure that any potentially responsive materials are provided to us and then conducting a page-by-page and line-by-line review of all responsive records. \n\nOCIO has provided us with potentially responsive records and your request has been added to our processing queue.  It is very difficult to provide an accurate estimated date of completion until our FOIA analyst reviews these records for responsiveness and we have a better sense of the number of pages and the sensitivity of the material.  The Privacy Office is also coordinating the Department\u2019s response to requests related to COVID-19; many of these requesters asked and qualified for expedited processing, meaning that they are required to be placed at the front of the queue.  Again, our general expectation is that we will be able to send you a final response within three to four months.  Please know that this estimate may change dramatically based on the volume of work associated with our expedited COVID-19 requests and on the types of records that OCIO has provided us for your request.  Regardless of the specificity of your request, we cannot accurately estimate the amount of time it will take to process the record until we understand both the volume and sensitivity of the record. \n\nWhile we make every effort to be responsive to requesters and hope to be able to respond to you sooner, there may be additional delays. \n\nI hope that this response provides additional insight into why we are not able to give you a more precise estimated date of completion, and why we expect it will take three to four months for us to respond to your request.  Please let us know if you have any other questions about our processes. \n\nRespectfully, \n\nDHS Privacy Office \nDisclosure and FOIA Program \nSTOP 0655 \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE \nWashington, DC 20032 \nTelephone: 1-866-431-0486 or 202-343-1743 \nFax: 202-343-4011 \nfoia@hq.dhs.gov \nVisit our FOIA website",

        "communication": "Dear Records Custodian,\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (MCL 15.231 et. seq.) for documents that detail how your community\u2019s water system functions, including details on utility terminations, restorations, and rates.\r\n\r\nAs context for this request, I am requesting these records on behalf of the People\u2019s Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization that advocates for equitable access, protection, and affordability of utility services, and water conservation. We are filing similar requests for information with many other Michigan water utilities in collaboration with residents, community leaders, and local officials to better support the needs of low-income customers. If any of this information is publicly available and accessible, please send a link to the webpage where it is located. Please reply to this request via email. If you have any question or concern about this request, please call Cass Charrette at 248-980-1191.\r\n\r\nWhen possible, please provide the requested quantitative data in an Excel spreadsheet or other native digital format (such as CSV files). \r\n\r\n1. A copy of any data and documents that list the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service terminated starting January 1, 2019 to date of the submission of the FOIA, the reason for the termination, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this data is produced in another format, such as written logs or summary reports, please provide a copy of that instead. If your agency has a policy that home address information is exempt from FOIA, please provide this data at the street level. \r\n\r\n2. Any documents describing and listing the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service restored starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, following a disconnection. If this data is included in the same data set as Item 6, you may provide that full data set in lieu of processing this element separately.\r\n\r\n3. A copy of any existing, regularly generated reports that include the total amount of water and wastewater customer arrearages, number of customers in arrears, and median amount of arrearages per customer, and number of customers subject to potential service disconnection due to arrears by customer class (e.g., residential, non-profit, commercial, industrial) starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA. \r\n\r\n4. A copy of a list of referrals the utility/water system/municipality sent to the tax assessor to place a tax lien on properties due to non-payment of any water or sewer bill, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this information is stored in a summary database, you may provide that database.\r\n\r\n5. Any documents describing or listing the addresses of residential customer accounts that have been enrolled in and have been discharged from the Great Lakes Water Authority\u2019s Water Residential Assistance Program, and the reason for such removal or discharge, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA. \r\n\r\nAs I am requesting these records as a representative of People\u2019s Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization, and am doing so in the public interest, I request a waiver of fees. The analysis and release of these materials will contribute significantly to public understanding of water affordability issues in the tri-county area. \r\n\r\nI will expect a response within 5 business days as provided by law. If my request is denied in whole or in part, I expect a detailed justification for withholding the records. I also request any segregable portions that are not exempt to be disclosed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for reducing the burden of my request, please reach out and we are happy to discuss.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPeople\u2019s Water Board Coalition",

If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

Your request mentioned: \u201cAll reports, video recordings, audio records, lab results, evidence looks, search warrant applications and returns, 911 calls and CAD reports and any other documents possessed by your agency related to the murder of Randy Gori on Jan . 4, 2020. \nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\u201d The amount of information requested is \"unduly burdensome\" for the public body. Before declining to comply with a request as unduly burdensome, the public body must extend to the requester an opportunity to reduce the request to manageable proportions. If a public body determines that the burden on the public body outweighs the public interest in obtaining the information, and that there is no way to narrow the request, it must notify the requester in writing, specifying the reasons why it would be unduly burdensome and the extent to which compliance would so burden the operations of the public body. Such a response is treated as a denial of the FOIA request. See 5 ILCS 140/3(g).\u00a0\u00a0As such the Madison County Sheriff's Office is attempting to determine the extent and information that is present in the case and being\u00a0requested.\u00a0 Under\u00a0section 3(e) of FOIA provides that the period for response may be extended by the public body The time for response may be extended if: (ii) the request requires the collection of a substantial number of specified records; The Madison County, IL has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request.\u00a0 Your request is granted in part and denied in part.\u00a0 These files were found to be redacted and released with the following exemptions: 7(1)(a) \u2013 In that the request relates to records prohibited from release by Federal or State law (i.e. Juvenile Arrest Records) 7(1)(b) \u2013 Private Information such as SSN, Phone Number(s), Addresses, DL numbers are protected from release 7(1)(c) \u2013 Releasing the records constitutes an unreasonable Invasion of Personal Privacy of those involved. DOB\u2019s and family matters in which personal privacy outweighs the public interest are exempt. \"personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\u00a0 Section 7(1)(c) defines an \"[u]nwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" as \"the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.\" 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) (West 2018) In determining whether or not the disclosure of personal information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the public\u2019s interest in disclosure must be balanced against the degree of invasion of privacy. FOIA contemplates a case-by-case analysis that is necessarily based upon the specific facts underlying a request for disclosure. A few examples of the types of information that have been approved by the Public Access Counselor for redaction under 7(1) (c) include: dates of birth; names and identifying information of victims in police reports; and graphic photos of the deceased\u2019s body in an autopsy report. FOIA exempts from disclosure personal information\u00a0contained in public records if disclosing that information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u00a0for the person or persons to whom the information pertains. \"Personal information\" has been defined by the courts as information \"that is private and confidential.\"\u00a0Chicago Tribune v.

The City requested my assistance in reviewing the materials responsive to your request for Ethics Board records to determine disclosure and to deliver those that are not exempt to you electronically. I was provided what I am told is the entire pertinent file and have completed an exemption review.\r\nI found that none of the records in the file is exempt from disclosure or in need of redaction. Accordingly I have attached in electronic format the entire Board of Ethics file that you requested.\nRegards\r\nD. Randall DiBella\r\nCramer & Anderson LLP\r\nFor the City of Danbury",

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all non-exempt, classified individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, title, department or agency, full-time/part-time status, work zip code, original hire date, civil service status, and gross annual salary (i.e., the base hourly wage for each hourly employee and the base annual salary for salaried employees for each of the time periods in question). If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status, and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2022. For each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status, and gross annual salary.\u201d  We\u2019ve now had time to review your request in detail and have determined that we require more specific information from you before we can begin to gather any responsive documents.\r\n\r\nThe information you have requested is below:\r\n\u00b7  State Employee\u2019s Full Name (first, middle, last, suffix)\r\n\u00b7  Unique employee identification code\r\n\u00b7  Agency/Department\r\n\u00b7  Position/Job Title\r\n\u00b7  Race\r\n\u00b7  Gender\r\n\u00b7  Full-time/Part-time status\r\n\u00b7  Location\r\n\u00b7  Hire date\r\n\u00b7  Termination date\r\n\u00b7  Civil service status\r\n\u00b7  Gross annual salary\r\nYou noted that you would like data pulled for each month, would that be for the first of each month requested? Meaning you would like data for Jan. 1, 2019, Feb. 1, 2019, March 1, 2019\u2026etc. through May 1, 2022 or June 1, 2022? You also asked for data for the following offices: offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments. Could you be more specific about which agencies or departments for which you would like information? If you would like all enterprise data, that would include the Governor\u2019s office and state agencies, we do not have a lieutenant governor. If you would like boards and commissions, we could include that. Also, below you note hire date and termination date, if you are looking for current employees we will only have hire dates and not termination dates. When you say civil service status, what do you mean, specifically?\r\nWe may not have complete information regarding some of the above fields. We will know more once we begin our search.\r\nAfter you\u2019ve refined your request, we will provide you with an estimated cost, which will include the cost of staff to research and locate the records, as well as the cost to copy, compile, and legally review and redact the records of any confidential material. Once you\u2019ve paid this estimated cost, we will begin the process of searching for and compiling the records to provide you with any non-exempt, responsive documents.\r\nAttached please find our public records policy, which further describes our costs and process (https://www.oregon.gov/das/Policies/107-001-030.pdf).\r\nThank you,\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D87B44.34123270]\r\nAndrea Chiapella\r\nCommunications Director\r\nDepartment of Administrative Services<https://www.oregon.gov/das/>\n971-345-1333\r\nPronouns: she, her, hers",

If Oregon does not have a program like that or if the data is unavailable, please exclude it. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any other clarification questions. \r\n\r\nBen",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Shift length/times of all Student Resource Officers (SROs) employed in the county dating from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. In particular the data should include (although not restricted to): officer badge number, date of shift, hours of shift (e.g. 9:00-17:00), race of officer, age of officer, experience of officer, and school assigned to.\r\n\r\n2. Of the officers in item (1) above, shift length/times of every shift the officer has worked within the department regardless of assignment. For instance, if an officer was assigned as an SRO in 2017, I am looking for all of their completed shift data from January 1, 2010 - December 31, 2019 including: officer badge number, date of shift, hours of shift (same as above in (1)).\r\n\r\n3. For each officer in item (1), all use-of-force reports and complaints filed by/against each officer.\r\n\r\n4. All student arrests  made by SRO officers from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. Information should include student race/age/sex, date of occurrence, and SRO badge number. \r\n\r\nPlease provide me with these public records in a machine-readable ASCII format, such as a CSV, SQL, TXT, or similar raw file. CSV or SQL files are preferred when available. Please email the responsive records to my email address: michaeltopper@ucsb.edu.\r\n\r\nIf email transmission is not feasible, I agree to prepay the actual cost of the storage medium on which the responsive records are transmitted, any postage costs incurred. My mailing address is:\r\n\r\nMichael Topper\r\n2915 Lomita Rd Unit B\r\nSanta Barbara, CA 93105\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Are the releasable contents of the record(s) meaningfully informative in relation to the subject of the request?  \r\n  * Is the focus on contributing to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government rather than the requester\u2019s own understanding or that of a narrow segment of interested persons?  \r\n  * Will any likely contribution to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government be significant? \r\nRequests for fee waivers should address these requirements in sufficient detail for us to make an informed decision, as each request is considered on its own merits.\u00a0 After a thorough review, it was determined that your request does not meet these requirements and we have, therefore, denied it.\u00a0 Since we have categorized you as \u201cmedia\u201d and records, if any, would be sent electronically, we do not anticipate any associated FOIA processing fees. \r\nAs regards your request for expedited processing, before approving such a request, we would have to determine that there was a compelling need for the information, and it is the requester\u2019s burden to demonstrate this.\u00a0 \"Compelling need\" can mean either that (1) failure to obtain the records could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to an individual's life or safety, or (2) the information is \"urgently needed\" and its value will be lost if not disseminated quickly.\u00a0 The basis you provided does not demonstrate the kind of compelling need required for us to place your request ahead of all the others that are pending.\u00a0 We must, therefore, deny your request for expedited processing. \r\nIf you consider the above adverse determinations, you may appeal within FOIAonline.\u00a0 If you prefer, you may write to the Department of the Navy, Judge Advocate General (Code 14), 1322 Patterson Avenue SE, Suite 3000, Washington Navy Yard, DC\u00a0 20374-5066.\u00a0 Your appeal, if any, must be postmarked within 90 calendar days from the date of this correspondence and should include a statement indicating why you believe it should be granted.\u00a0 I recommend that your letter and its envelope both bear the notation, \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal\u201d. \r\nYou also have the right to seek assistance and/or dispute resolution services from the Department of the Navy FOIA Public Liaison, Mr. Christopher Julka, at Christopher.a.julka@navy.mil or (703) 697-0031.\u00a0 You may also contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) for assistance and/or dispute resolution at ogis@nara.gov or (877) 684-6448.\u00a0 For more information online about services provided by OGIS, please visit their website at www.archives.gov/ogis/. (http://www.archives.gov/ogis/) \r\nAs the analyst assigned, if you should have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at 703-614-4008 or hqmcfoia@usmc.mil. \r\nMichael Peters \r\nDeputy, FOIA/PA Programs",
