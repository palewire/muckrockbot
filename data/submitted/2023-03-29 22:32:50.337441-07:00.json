His company is called Navy Yard Hospitality, I believe. \r\nI am interested in knowing if Massport has had any jurisdiction over the development of that site, including the gangway to the ship. \r\nThe City of Boston\u2019s Inspectional Services said it was not under their jurisdiction, and suggested I contact your office. \r\nI also know that the Project was done under the regulations for Massachusetts (Chapter 91). I am interested in any architectural drawings, Permit applications and Permits related to the gangway leading from the Pier up to the ship.\r\nPlease let me know if this is in your jurisdiction, and how I can get access to the building permit documents for that restaurant.\r\nThank You,\r\nVictor A.
