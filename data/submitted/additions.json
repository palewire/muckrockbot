There is documentation of its existence and has been viewed by detectives after the 2001 DNA connection was made between the East Area Rapist attacks in Northern CA and the Original Night Stalker rape/murders in Southern CA. This is evidence in a double homicide so it existed as late as 2018. I am requesting any documentation of its existence and, if it no longer exists, what happened to it.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Neville",
