If the number is zero as of the date the this request is received, then publicly state this. \r\n\r\nI research missing and unidentified person cases as a hobby, and I am curious to know if California's smallest county has any active unidentified deceased cases. \r\n\r\nThank you for the Alpine County Sheriff's Office for their commitment to transparency, and I look forward to learning this information.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
