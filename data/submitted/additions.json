Farr, Lopez Arrigo, Frederic William Aykens, James Darnell, James Gary, James Gay, Robert Gordan, Walter Lee-Lyte Parman, Robert Rodriguez, and Edgar K. Sanders.\r\n\r\nWalter Lee Parman was involved in various criminal activities, was on the FBI's Most Wanted List, and was convicted for the murder of Shirley Ann Cary in 1965. He also escaped from prison and was recaptured in 1984 under the alias Mike Noble. I am particularly interested in any recorded testimony given under the influence of sodium pentathol during his trial.\r\n\r\nPlease include all relevant files, correspondence, arrest records, and any other materials related to these matters. If some portions of these documents are exempt from release, please provide me with the non-exempt portions.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying the records, please inform me of the cost before processing my request. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public's understanding of the case.\r\n\r\nIf my request is denied in whole or in part, please justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the act. I expect the release of all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. I reserve the right to appeal any decision to withhold information or deny a waiver of fees.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNathan Isaac",
