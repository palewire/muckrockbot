The simulation would involve \u201cfake firearms in a mock shooting,\u201d the department said it wrote to school staff on May 23. \r\n\r\nI am looking for:\r\n\r\n- planning documents, memos, emails or other communications about the planning of the described demonstration\r\n- emails between the department and the school staff about the scheduled demonstration. Please include the May 23rd email to school staff \r\n- after action reports or communications within the department after the incident.\r\n- surveillance footage of the incident or recordings of the incident\r\n\r\nAs required under the law, I request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically. If you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory exemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to only a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and provide the remainder of the record, as required under the statute.\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Reporting can be done through our online reporting portal or by downloading, completing and then submitting FDA Form 3500 (Health Professional) or 3500B (Consumer/Patient) to MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program. I am looking for:\r\n- The current database schema, data dictionary, or other reference document(s) to show how the FDA tracks these reports.\r\n - A database export or disaggregated data of reports submitted to this system since 2020.  If possible please include accompanying documentation submitted by the complainant. Please include the relevant fields releasable under the law. \r\n\r\nAs required under FOIA, I request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically. If you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory exemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to only a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and provide the remainder of the record, as required under the FOIA. \r\n\r\nAs a reporter for the WIRED, I qualify as a news media requester for the purpose of fees. See 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(ii). Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

In particular, I am requesting a single spreadsheet (with different sheets for each month) or a series of spreadsheets for each month with the following variables (where DEPARTMENT NAME == CDCR): \r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT NAME\r\nFACILITY NAME\r\nCOUNTY NAME\r\nLAST NAME\t\r\nFIRST NAME\r\nINT INDICATOR\r\nCLASSIFICATION TITLE\r\nCLASS TYPE\r\nCEA INDICATOR\r\nTIME BASE\r\nTENURE\r\nSALARY PER\r\nBASE SALARY\r\nON-LEAVE INDICATOR\r\nUNIQUE IDENTIFIER\r\nSAFETY MEMBER\r\nOASDI\r\nCBID\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

You requested employee data from January 2010 through December 2018.  We are able to provide the requested data from December 2010 through December 2018 at no cost in 4-5 weeks; however, the CBID field will not be on the report until October 2013.\r\n\r\nIf you need the data for January 2010 through November 2010, it would take 7-9 weeks, at an estimated cost of $1,810-$1,970, depending on the number of programming hours required.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you would like to proceed.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DAB7FC.22781E70]\r\nDave Brownfield | Staff Counsel\r\nOffice of State Controller Malia M.
