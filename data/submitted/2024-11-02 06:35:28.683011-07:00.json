Complete and Transparent Documentation\r\n  Provide all requested documents in full, without redactions unless legally required.

Delays could harm these populations by preventing timely corrective action.\r\n\r\nCompliance with FOIA Promptness Standards: Federal and Connecticut FOIA statutes require agencies to make records available \u201cpromptly.\u201d Any refusal to expedite processing would contravene both the letter and intent of FOIA law.\r\n\r\nPotential Financial and Legal Violations: Requested records may reveal misuse of Medicaid funds or improper labor practices. Immediate access is necessary for regulatory assessment.\r\n\r\nRequest for Immediate Acknowledgment: Please provide immediate, written acknowledgment of this expedited processing request. If expedited processing is denied, provide a written statement detailing the specific legal grounds for denial, in compliance with FOIA statutes.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n215 Mountain Street\r\nWillimantic, CT 06226\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

If expedited processing is denied, provide a written statement detailing the specific legal grounds for denial, in compliance with FOIA statutes.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n215 Mountain Street\r\nWillimantic, CT 06226\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Confirmation of Accommodations\r\n  Confirm receipt of this request, and explicitly acknowledge that each accommodation listed will be fully applied in all responses and communications.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing of FOIA Request for Records Pertaining to Medicaid Services for NPI 1962278119 and NPI 1023012345\r\nPursuant to Federal Law and Connecticut FOIA Statutes, I am requesting expedited processing of this FOIA request due to the pressing public interest involved and the immediate impact on vulnerable Medicaid beneficiaries, as authorized under applicable legal provisions.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\nLegal Basis: Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), expedited processing is required when there is an \u201curgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d Additionally, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210(a) mandates prompt availability of public agency records, especially where issues directly impact public welfare and accountability.\r\n\r\nJustification for Expedited Processing\r\nPublic Interest and Transparency: These records are crucial for public scrutiny of Medicaid spending, potential monopolistic practices, consumer choice limitations, and wage compliance within Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\n\r\nImmediate Impact on Vulnerable Populations: This request addresses policies that may limit autonomy, financial independence, and housing security for Medicaid beneficiaries, especially those with disabilities. Delays could harm these populations by preventing timely corrective action.\r\n\r\nCompliance with FOIA Promptness Standards: Federal and Connecticut FOIA statutes require agencies to make records available \u201cpromptly.\u201d Any refusal to expedite processing would contravene both the letter and intent of FOIA law.\r\n\r\nPotential Financial and Legal Violations: Requested records may reveal misuse of Medicaid funds or improper labor practices. Immediate access is necessary for regulatory assessment.\r\n\r\nRequest for Immediate Acknowledgment: Please provide immediate, written acknowledgment of this expedited processing request. If expedited processing is denied, provide a written statement detailing the specific legal grounds for denial, in compliance with FOIA statutes.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n215 Mountain Street\r\nWillimantic, CT 06226\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records that are releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the relevant provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Rabbit was born in May 15th of 1905 in the state of Montana and died in March 1961 in Seattle, Washington. Rabbitt was publicly labeled as a communist during the Canwell Committee hearings in Washington State. In the early 1950s Rabbitt was head of the Washington State Progressive Party. \r\n\r\nPlease note: A previous FOIA release (FOIA Request: 1215960-000, SUBJECT: ROSELLINI, ALBERT DEAN) prominently mentions that as of 1952 Rabbitt was a, \"Security Index subject at the Seattle office\" of the FBI. As a \"Security Index subject\" the bureau presumably amassed a significant amount of material on Rabbitt. \r\n\r\nPlease include searches for correspondence either to or from Director Hoover or Clyde Tolson regarding Rabbitt. Please also include a search for correspondence either to or from Mark Felt regarding Rabbit. Felt was assigned to the Seattle office in the early 1950s and could have generated material on Rabbitt during the course of his duties. \r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about Thomas \"Tom\" Carlyle Rabbitt from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Rabbit held by the Seattle or Chicago field offices. Rabbit lived in, and repeatedly visited, the city of Chicago.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Rabbitt. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Thomas Carlyle Rabbitt. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency.

Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

According to the Final Response, my request was rejected because it failed to request \"specific records.\" This is not correct. I gave specific examples of the sort of records that would be responsive to my request,  namely \"emails, correspondence, memos, and transcriptions of telephone calls.\" I also mentioned a specific office where such records might be located.\r\n\r\nI therefore appeal the rejection and reiterate my request. \r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

Such communications may include, but should not be limited to, emails, correspondence, memos, and transcriptions of telephone calls.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",
