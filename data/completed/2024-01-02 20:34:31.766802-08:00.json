        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B2 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your agency provided substantially similar data in 2022. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

However, I would also need to know if you need the information for hourly employees as this is a large data pull and if it requires data extraction we would have to charge per hour per the CA PRA.\r\n\r\nPlease advise, thank you so much!\r\n\r\nLeanne Flashberg,\r\nExecutive Assistant to Robert S.

        "communication": "Hi Taylor, \r\n\r\nThank you so much for the patience and detail oriented attention to this request. IF we could get the first part of the request accomplished, the second one is fine to take more than three days, particularly during the holiday period we are entering. \r\n\r\n1. Call 23017731 - Please provide details and records on any other calls, investigations, reports, logs, notes, bookings or contact reports, complaints or other data for Police Department or Sheriff's Office to the Carpenter Wilderness trailhead area, the addresses adjacent to or bordering 1050 Lebanon, or responses that were made within 400 yards either side on or around that date and time. -- this one is important, and yes I would like a copy of the audio and if there was any officer camera footage, please archive that and let me know the cost. \r\n\r\n2, This call may have occurred the same day from multiple parties, or there may have been other complaints filed nonemergency which is why I wanted other information about the vicinity geographically about the park. Because there is a potential for Carpenter Trails to be considered an 'attractive nuisance' I was curious about establishing a baseline of complaints and complaint types for the vicinity of the trailhead, the park, and also the 1050 Lebanon Rd. address. I am familiar with geofencing and use of ArcGIS / QGIS for establishing a query based on geography so I requested a buffer around the park of 400 yards for the calls. It's perfectly okay for this part of the FOIA / CORA to take longer than three days, and in fact, I would say that I expect to hear \"The Cortez Police Department is extending the time to respond to this request due to the extenuating circumstances of searching for the data requested through a geographical reference method across several years in time...\" with an estimate if possible to set expectations.\r\n\r\n So, for part 2 no issues with it taking a reasonable amount of time to research. With part 1, if we could expedite the audio recording of the initial call in from Rachael Marchbanks on April 29, 2023,  Call 23017731, I would be ever so grateful because it would expedite my research and query into the matter. It's okay to provide updates as they come in rather than simply await it all to be aggregated, in fact I would appreciate it being provided via digital as you obtain it. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter",
