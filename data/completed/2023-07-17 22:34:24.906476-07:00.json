Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action. \r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force. \r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes: \r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm]. \r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Additionally, there have been five follow up requests for the information. To date, the Town of Haverstraw has been unresponsive, in direct conflict with state law. As you know, government agencies that do not respond may be subject to fines and/or court fees for failure to comply with a lawful request. \r\n\r\nUnder the possibility that the original request and follow ups were misdirected, we are repeating the request and broadening the recipients. Please respond within five days as the law allows: \r\n\r\nAll materials and records describing and sufficient to show/disclose all allegations of misconduct made and all disciplinary proceedings taken against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency.\r\nAs described in the New York Freedom of Information Law, a record is \"any information kept, held, filed, produced or reproduced by, with or for an agency or the state legislature, in any physical form whatsoever including, but not limited to, reports, statements, examinations, memoranda, opinions, folders, files, books, manuals, pamphlets, forms, papers, designs, drawings, maps, photos, letters, microfilms, computer tapes or discs, rules, regulations or codes.\" Records kept in a digital or electronic form are also records, would be responsive to this request, and should be provided.\r\nThese records are typically required to be retained under the New York State Records Retention and Disposition Schedule MU-1 (http://www.archives.nysed.gov/records/retention_mu-1), including, but not limited to, item no. 365, which includes: \"Investigative records and disciplinary proceedings, including but not limited to statement of charge, transcript of hearing, notice of decision, letter of termination or resignation, letter of reinstatement, record of appeal procedure, and correspondence.\" While materials under that schedule have a set retention of 3 years after the final decision rendered, this request and materials responsive to it include *all* records held in the possession of any office or individual employed or formerly employed by this policing agency, including those kept off-site, in digital form, and in personnel files.\r\nPlease note that any failure to provide all potentially-responsive materials and/or the destruction of materials potentially responsive to this request would be a violation of the spirit of the New York Freedom of Information Law, as well as unlawful under the New York FOIL and the terms of the attached litigation hold notice.\r\nMaterials responsive to this request include \u2014 but are not limited to \u2014 all complaints, reports, records of discipline and penalties, aggregate collections of complaint and disciplinary materials (spreadsheets, databases), investigatory materials, relevant related correspondence, photographs, video, other related evidence, proof of discipline or fulfillment of penalties, and all personnel materials (including those used in promotion, contract, and other employment negotiations and considerations) that reference or utilize misconduct allegations or disciplinary materials of any sort.\r\nMaterials responsive to this request include all complaints\u2014 internal, external, and civilian \u2014 and include records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident/complaint: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the investigation, investigatory materials, the disposition of the case, and any subsequent materials related to the execution of any resultant discipline. Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action.\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force.\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes:\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described.

On 11/17/2022 a Supervisory Government Information Specialist in the VA OIG Release of Information Office named Ruthlee G. Bellamy Falsely Responded that VA OIG posessed none of the Requested Information as pertaining to VA OIG Michael J. Missal.\r\n\r\nOn 12/12/2022 US DVA FOIA Officer as well as Management and Program ANALYST Mark Littlefield Responded on behalf of US DVA with a total of 8 e-mail records pertaining to only two of the Request's identified subjects; namely VA Officers Chihung Szeto and Eugene Skinner.\r\n\r\nOn 12/28/2022 - a Government Informaiton Specialist in the VA Office of Inspector General Information Release Office named Ms. Johnson Responded with some to all requested Information Requested as pertains to VA OIG Michael Missal. While thankful for the provided Information Requested, the partial Response thoroughly proves that: a) VA OIG via Ruthlee G. Bellamy provided a False and / or otherwise improper \"Final Agency Response\" of \"Full Denial\" and b) given the Fact some of the Requested Information provided via Ms. Johnson contains such regarding Eugene Skinner and Chihung Szeto that is not in ANALYST Mark Littlefield's Response for such information; it's apparent Mr. Littlefield's account of the search for such Requested Information is False, erroneous or reliant upon False information directly provided by Eugene Skinner and Chihung Szeto.\r\n\r\nTo date none of the Requested Information regarding Mr.s Harris, Trinh, McDonough, Merchant, Braverman, MacGahran, Simms, Rychalski and VAPD has been provided; and in light of False, erroneous and / or misleading information so slowly provided in Response to this Request - there's evident concern for a lack of integrity and violation of Federal Public Law governing FOIA. I respectfully demand a diligent, full, complete, honest and lawful Response to my long overdue Request pertaining to Public Officials' Federal Advisory Committee records pertaining to the VCOEB within the Request's specified time period without further delay and apparent suppression of said Information which the U.S. Federal Government is mandated to provide.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRyan Thompson",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    A copy of file 62-24172, specifically including portions not on the FBI's\r\n    website. A release of only preprocessed materials will explicitly not be\r\n    sufficient.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Daniel Bledsoe. As you probably recall, the FBI located approximately 1330 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFOIA Negotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nNeed a status check?

While I am requesting records that originated with the University's intercollegiate sports program, I am of the belief that such records are in the custody of the Open Records Manager. \r\n\r\nUpon information and belief, your office retains records of public records requests received and *your office's responses to each request, including any records disclosed to the requestor*, for 3 years, in compliance with the University System of Georgia's record retention policy. \r\n\r\nThe Athens Banner-Herald previously requested certain University of Georgia Athletic Association (UGAA) records on August 2, 2021 (#21-371). On November 2, 2021, you denied this request. In October 2022, the Athens Banner-Herald made a \"Renewed Open Records Request\" directly to the UGAA. This request was fulfilled in March 2023 pursuant to court order. \r\n\r\nIt is unclear if your office is responsible for retaining records relating to the ABH's October 2022 request. If your office does currently hold these records, you have incorrectly claimed that my request falls under the scope of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 50-18-71(d.1), and I would ask that you process my request under the standard parameters of the Georgia Open Records Act. \r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nLandon Edwards\r\n",

        "communication": "I am writing in response to your recent communications regarding my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request dated March 7, 2023. I appreciate your efforts in identifying over 16,000 emails that may be potentially responsive to my request. However, I would like to clarify a few points to ensure a comprehensive and compliant response to my request.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I understand that the identified emails need to be reviewed to determine which ones contain potential education records and which ones do not, as per Public Officers Law 87(2)(a) and 20 U.S.C. 1232g, or interagency documents under Public Officers Law 87(2)(g). I also acknowledge that certain emails may be precluded from disclosure under Public Officers Law \u00a787(2)(a) (C.P.L.R. \u00a73101(c), and C.P.L.R. \u00a74503(a)). However, it is important to note that these regulations do not necessitate the wholesale removal of emails. Rather, they require specific redactions of sensitive information while leaving intact factual or other information that aligns with relevant redaction scopes.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, I would like to request that the School District ensures that redactions are specific and do not result in the removal of entire emails that contain responsive factual information not covered under the exemptions mentioned. The redaction process should be conducted in a manner that respects the principles of transparency and accountability, as outlined in the New York State Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I would like to clarify that the 16,000 emails identified are indeed responsive to my request. The wording in your response suggests a conflation between the terms \"responsive\" and \"redacted\". I understand that the School District is reviewing these emails to determine which ones require further redaction, not to determine their responsiveness.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would like to request a rolling response to my FOIL request. Given the large number of emails identified, it would be beneficial to receive the emails in batches as they are reviewed and redacted, rather than waiting for the entire batch to be processed. This would allow for a more timely and efficient review of the information.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your attention to these matters and look forward to your continued cooperation in fulfilling my FOIL request. Please feel free to contact me if you require any further clarification or information.",

Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nI am requesting these records in order to conduct research on a matter of public interest. I believe that these records will be helpful in understanding the activities of these individuals and their impact on the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPAC Bellevue",

For example, during the identified time period, Eva Collins appears in the \u201cto\u201d and/or \u201cfrom\u201d fields of 23,943 emails. We will need to review each email to check for protected information (such as student identifiers or privileged legal communications). The same will apply to the other forms of electronic communications.\r\n\r\nI want to get you what you\u2019re looking for as quickly and efficiently as possible. Perhaps we could break this request into pieces and work on one piece at a time? If you like, we could search first for communications sent/received between these five employees and produce those records to you. We can then move through the remainder of the request in whatever order you prefer. Please let me know if this approach would be acceptable to you.\r\n\r\nI have begun identifying potentially responsive email records. Once we hear back from you about the desired scope of your request and your preferred method for organizing our search, I will provide you with an anticipated date for our first production of records.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSarah\r\n\r\nSarah Kolpacoff\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nGeneral Counsel\u2019s Office\r\nBellevue School District No. 405\r\n(425) 456-4101\r\npublicrecords@bsd405.org<mailto:publicrecords@bsd405.org>",

This production contains 122 email messages (503 pages) sent from Superintendent Jarvis to Melissa Devita from January 1, 2023 to May 16, 2023:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/e7vuam8pmx6g689nr88vy/Jarvis-to-Devita-1.1.23_5.16.23-122-msgs-_Redacted.pdf?rlkey=168h1tpyisuwhvdfdtze9oy5o&dl=0\r\n(Please let me know if you have any trouble accessing the records in this format.)\r\n\r\nNo records have been withheld or exempted from this production. In keeping with our obligations under the Public Records Act, which exempts information identifying students and/or parents [RCW 42.56.230(1) & 42.56.070(1)], we have redacted student/parent names, email addresses and phone numbers from these records. As communications between attorneys and clients are also exempt from production [RCW 42.56.070(1) & RCW 5.60.060(2)(a)], some portions of emails containing those communications have been redacted. Every redaction has been marked with a code corresponding to the attached redaction information sheet. The sheet provides additional information about the basis for each redaction.\r\n\r\nI continue to work on responsive emails sent during the period of January 1, 2023 to May 16, 2023 and anticipate that our next installment of records will be ready on or before September 1, 2023. If records are available sooner, I will provide them to you.

With racial equity as a central component of safety and security planning, it is imperative that all school safety and security staff not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.\"\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2. Provide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3. Provide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nNote: If your agency chooses not to produce the requested records in reverse chronological order as requested, and/or chooses to sandbag this request by dribbling out a few records per installment every 6 months (tee-hee), you can expect a separate targeted public records request for each line item by year - submitted via multiple members of the public, multiple times until the requested records are timely produced. This simple three part multi year request would then become twelve (12) separate public records requests. If your agency would prefer 12 separate individual requests, please let us know.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\"You can't go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you\r\nare and change the ending.\" - C.S.

I understand that the next step involves reviewing the emails for any personal or sensitive information that may need to be redacted.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to clarify the regulations regarding the costs associated with a FOIL request. According to the New York State Public Officers Law \u00a787(1)(b)(iii), an agency may charge a fee for copies of records, but not for the time spent redacting or reviewing them. This is further supported by the Committee on Open Government, which has consistently advised that an agency may not charge for the time involved in redacting electronic documents.\r\n\r\nAs such, while I acknowledge that there may be costs associated with copying the records onto a thumb drive, any costs associated with the time spent by your attorneys to review and redact information should not be passed on to the requester.\r\n\r\nI also want to confirm, based on your email, that the IT department has successfully copied the records onto a medium that can be provided, which in this case is a thumb drive.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response and the provision of the requested records.\r\n",
