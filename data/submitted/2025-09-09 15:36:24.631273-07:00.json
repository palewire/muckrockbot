A uniformed security patrol officer in a Citiguard vehicle approached them. The security officer asks them to stop recording and leave property, and then appears to initiate a vehicle pursuit in a Citiguard marked patrol vehicle on public roads that reach reported speeds of 70mph to 100mph. According to BSIS's website, Citiguard's owner is GHARZAI NOMAIR, and Citiguard has two  previous citations for employing non-licensed security officers. \r\n\r\nAs such, I am requesting the following:\r\n1) Citiguard's License, Certificates, or other verification documents that indicate their authority to work in California City, CA\r\n2) Citiguard's current Private Patrol Operator application and/or most recent renewal application, packet, or documentation submitted to achieve BSIS licensure for license 121572, and for any branch or other licenses that permit Citiguard's operations within California City, CA. \r\n3) Any complaints, investigations, notices, or tips related to Citiguard from January 2024 through the date of completion of this request \r\n4) Any emails that your office has received or sent relating to the September 2nd, 2025 incident involving Citiguard at the CoreCivic Detention Center\r\n5) Any Citiguard policies relating to foot or vehicle pursuits, use of force continuum, verbal de-escalation, or patrol SOPs that are in your possession\r\n\r\nThis is a newsworthy event, I respectfully request that you expedite this request to the extent possible. You may send documents as they become available. I appreciate you taking the time to fulfil this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The Mississippi Public Records act of 1983 only requires the production of records that exist, and does not require the creation of the document you are requesting.  Consequently, we have no records that are responsive to your request.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, with regard to the underlying data from GPS tracker devices, to the extent there is any responsive record, your request for records is being denied.

Code, Part 1, Chapter 13, Rule 13.06(B)(13), which provides exemptions including but not limited to:  a. data compiled in the process of detecting and investigating any unlawful activity or alleged unlawful activity, the disclosure would harm such investigation; c. release of the information would impede the public body's enforcement, investigative or detection efforts; d. would disclose investigative techniques; and f. could endanger the life or safety of a public official or law enforcement personnel.\r\n\r\nYou may appeal the denial of your request to the Commissioner of Insurance, file a complaint with the Mississippi Ethics Commission, or may seek immediate judicial review of the denial in the Chancery Court.  An appeal to the Commissioner of Insurance shall be in writing, and shall include a statement of the circumstances, reasons or arguments advanced in support of disclosure, and a copy of any written denial issued.  See \u00a725-61-13 of the Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended, and 19 Miss. Admin. Code, Part 1, Chapter 13, Rule 13.09 (Review of Denials).\r\n\r\nThe undersigned is responsible for this Response.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Any communications between Interim United States Attorney Ed Martin and Georgetown University, Georgetown University Law Center, or William M.\u00a0Treanor\u00a0 between February 1, 2025 and May 8, 2025.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.5(e)(1)(ii) and (iv) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and academic freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely a United States Attorney's initiation of an \"inquiry\" into the academic content of courses at a private law school.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/05/dc-us-attorney-ed-martin-georgetown-law-dei/\r\nb. https://thepostmillennial.com/us-atty-ed-martin-demands-georgetown-law-school-answer-for-dei-in-curriculum-hiring-and-programs\r\nc. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html\r\nd. https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5181345-georgetown-law-school-dei-trump/\r\ne. https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-appointed-prosecutor-gets-much-needed-refresher-first-amendment-rcna195321\r\nf. https://www.rawstory.com/ed-martin-georgetown-clash/\r\ng. https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology\r\nh. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/ed-martin-us-attorney-dei\r\ni. https://www.newsmax.com/politics/georgetown-dei-william-treanor/2025/03/06/id/1201790/\r\nj. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/federal-fallout/georgetown-law-school-wont-bow-to-dei-threat-from-dcs-acting-federal-prosecutor-ed-martin-donald-trump-william-treanor/65-22ac5a1d-43a8-492b-92db-1f8c6f70f76c\r\nk. https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/03/07/dei-georgetown-us-attorney-first-amendment/81793644007/\r\nl. https://www.washingtonian.com/2025/03/07/william-treanor-georgetown-law-ed-martin-first-amendment/\r\nm. https://abovethelaw.com/2025/03/georgetown-law-to-ed-martin-f-all-the-way-off/\r\nn. https://www.thecollegefix.com/top-d-c-federal-prosecutor-says-he-doesnt-want-law-students-from-georgetown-because-of-dei/\r\no. https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/03/georgetown-william-treanor-ed-martin-trump-doj-dei.html\r\np. https://www.foxnews.com/media/georgetown-professors-slam-trumps-dei-crackdown-attack-religious-freedom-jesuit-schools\r\n\r\n4. This information is relevant to a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. There is widespread and exceptional media interest in this matter, as reflected in the above articles originating from outlets across the ideological spectrum. This matter raises \"possible questions\" about government integrity affecting public confidence because the alleged conduct involves a United States Attorney's pressure on a law school to limit viewpoints offered in classroom teaching protected by the First Amendment. A prominent First Amendment scholar has raised questions about the propriety of Attorney Martin's \"inquiry.\" Eugene Volokh, \"May Government Refuse to Hire Notre Dame Students, Because Notre Dame Teaches and Promotes Anti-Abortion Ideology?\" (Volokh Conspiracy, March 7, 2025), https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology. Further, Attorney Martin's letter was sent as members of the United States Senate requested disciplinary action against Attorney Martin due to his similar efforts to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment. See https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.10(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by an Interim United States Attorney.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

I am aware of prior requests, including those in *Roman v. Dep't of the Air Force, No. 12-1381 (EGS) (D.D.C. 2013)*, which sought locations of HAARP devices and test dates. To avoid duplication, I seek only records created, declassified, or otherwise made available after July 9, 2013, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Documents related to the transfer of HAARP facilities or operations to the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2015 or later, including agreements, environmental impact assessments, and declassification reviews.\r\n2. Reports, memoranda, emails, or cables concerning HAARP's goals, scope, testing dates, or additional facilities (beyond the known Gakona, Alaska site) from 2013 to the present, including any segregable portions of classified records.\r\n3. Records referenced in the George W. Bush Presidential Library finding aid for FOIA 2014-0038-F, such as drafts of the U.S. Arctic Research Plan Biennial Revision: 2004\u20132008, or electronic records (e.g., TS emails from 2001-2008) that have been declassified and transferred to Air Force custody.\r\n4. Any indexes, Vaughn lists, or descriptions of records withheld in the *Roman* case, including updates on their classification status post-2013.\r\n5. Communications between the Air Force and other agencies (e.g., DARPA, Navy, NSF) regarding HAARP operations, funding, or research after 2013.\r\n\r\nIf responsive records are classified or otherwise exempt from disclosure, please: (1) conduct a declassification review under Executive Order 13526; (2) release any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions; and (3) provide a detailed explanation, including applicable FOIA exemptions (e.g., 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)), along with a Vaughn index describing each withheld document.\r\n\r\nI request a fee waiver, as disclosure is in the public interest, contributing to understanding government research programs and transparency in ionospheric studies. If fees apply, please notify me in advance if they exceed $25.\r\n\r\nPlease provide records in electronic format (PDF) via email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
