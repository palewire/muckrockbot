The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn regard to item 1, please visit the following website for records responsive to this portion of your request:\u00a0https://cityclerk.lacity.org/lacityclerkconnect/index.cfm?fa=ccon.viewrecord&amp;contractnum=C-145843\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn regard to item 2, the Department has completed its review and is providing you with a record responsive to this portion of your request.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease note that under Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \u201cpublic records\u201d includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public\u2019s business and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities. Similarly, Sections 7927.700 exempt records and/or information the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest. Therefore, responsive emails containing personal information (i.e., personal signatures and account numbers) are being provided to you with redactions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn regard to items 3, 4, 6, and 7, please note that our office\u2014the LAPD Public Records and Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\u2014does not house the records you are seeking. The Department is in the process of searching for the requested records. Please note that some of the records to be provided, if any, may be redacted pursuant to California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000. We will provide an update by January 24, 2025, and will notify you should anything change.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn regard to item 5, the Department has conducted a search based on the information provided and no responsive records were located.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

Incident reports and case records refer to reports produced with notes and narratives, a description of what happened by the responding officer, trace reports, case notes and litigation files\r\n- All unedited body-worn camera / bodycam recordings. I am specifically requesting the unedited body-worn camera recordings captured by all officers present for the full duration of the incident, including audio recordings associated with the footage. If any portion of the requested footage must be redacted, I ask that you clearly indicate the portions that have been redacted and provide an explanation of the legal basis for the redactions\r\n- All 911 or calls for service logs, audio and transcripts\r\n- All computer aided dispatch (CAD) reports and a copy of your department\u2019s dispatch 10 signals/codes, agency dispatch signals/codes and CAD signals/codes\r\n\r\nI request these records in their native digital formats and not in formats that degrade the accessibility of the records, such as tabular data converted to PDF or Word files. If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files). Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, I additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nProduction of Responsive Records on a Rolling Basis: In the event that a portion of the present request is completed before the full request is completed, I ask that the records be produced on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSarah Hopkins",

To avoid duplication, I seek only records created, declassified, or otherwise made available after July 9, 2013, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Documents related to the transfer of HAARP facilities or operations to the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2015 or later, including agreements, environmental impact assessments, and declassification reviews.\r\n2. Reports, memoranda, emails, or cables concerning HAARP's goals, scope, testing dates, or additional facilities (beyond the known Gakona, Alaska site) from 2013 to the present, including any segregable portions of classified records.\r\n3. Records referenced in the George W. Bush Presidential Library finding aid for FOIA 2014-0038-F, such as drafts of the U.S. Arctic Research Plan Biennial Revision: 2004\u20132008, or electronic records (e.g., TS emails from 2001-2008) that have been declassified and transferred to Air Force custody.\r\n4. Any indexes, Vaughn lists, or descriptions of records withheld in the *Roman* case, including updates on their classification status post-2013.\r\n5. Communications between the Air Force and other agencies (e.g., DARPA, Navy, NSF) regarding HAARP operations, funding, or research after 2013.\r\n\r\nIf responsive records are classified or otherwise exempt from disclosure, please: (1) conduct a declassification review under Executive Order 13526; (2) release any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions; and (3) provide a detailed explanation, including applicable FOIA exemptions (e.g., 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)), along with a Vaughn index describing each withheld document.\r\n\r\nI request a fee waiver, as disclosure is in the public interest, contributing to understanding government research programs and transparency in ionospheric studies. If fees apply, please notify me in advance if they exceed $25.\r\n\r\nPlease provide records in electronic format (PDF) via email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I am aware of prior requests, including those in *Roman v. Dep't \r\nof the Air Force, No. 12-1381 (EGS) (D.D.C. 2013)*, which sought locations \r\nof HAARP devices and test dates. To avoid duplication, I seek only records \r\ncreated, declassified, or otherwise made available after July 9, 2013, \r\nincluding but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Documents related to the transfer of HAARP facilities or operations to \r\nthe University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2015 or later, including agreements, \r\nenvironmental impact assessments, and declassification reviews.\r\n2. Reports, memoranda, emails, or cables concerning HAARP's goals, scope, \r\ntesting dates, or additional facilities (beyond the known Gakona, Alaska \r\nsite) from 2013 to the present, including any segregable portions of \r\nclassified records.\r\n3. Records referenced in the George W.

Any indexes, Vaughn lists, or descriptions of records withheld in the \r\n*Roman* case, including updates on their classification status post-2013.\r\n5. Communications between the Air Force and other agencies (e.g., DARPA, \r\nNavy, NSF) regarding HAARP operations, funding, or research after 2013.\r\n\r\nIf responsive records are classified or otherwise exempt from disclosure, \r\nplease: (1) conduct a declassification review under Executive Order 13526; \r\n(2) release any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions; and (3) provide \r\na detailed explanation, including applicable FOIA exemptions (e.g., 5 \r\nU.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)), along with a Vaughn index describing each withheld \r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nI request a fee waiver, as disclosure is in the public interest, \r\ncontributing to understanding government research programs and transparency \r\nin ionospheric studies. If fees apply, please notify me in advance if they \r\nexceed $25.\r\n\r\nPlease provide records in electronic format (PDF) via email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and \r\nthis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform \r\nme of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please note, due to a software error, the \"fee charged\" has defaulted to zero for each request. There were certain requests from 2024 where the MBTA did charge a fee. If you have questions about any particular request, please let us know. \r\n\r\nIn addition, certain information has been redacted form this record, including dates of birth, license numbers, personal medical information, and the names of any injured parties. This information is exempt from disclosure under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 4, Section 7(26) (c), which exempts materials or data \u201crelating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d. The MBTA has determined that the public interest in the release of this personal information does not outweigh the privacy interests of the individual(s) involved. To the extent that this information falls under the definition of \u201cpersonal information\u201d under M.G.L. c. 93H and 201 CMR 17.00, it must be  redacted. In addition, the disclosure of personal data is prohibited by the federal Fair Information Practices Act and Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 66, Section 2(c) which states, in part, that every holder maintaining personal data shall \"not allow any other agency or individual not employed by the holder to have access to personal data unless such access is authorized by statute or regulations which are consistent with the purposes of this chapter...\" \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that in the case of a denial of access to records, you have the right to an administrative appeal to the Supervisor of Records, pursuant to 950 CMR 32.08(1) (the Code of Massachusetts Regulations), and the right to seek judicial review by commencing an action in the Superior Court. \r\n\r\nWe will provide the 2025 requests running to the date of your public records request soon. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJulie Ciollo \r\nAssistant General Counsel/ \r\nRecords Access Officer",

Code section 7922.535 provides in part as follows: \u201cEach agency, upon a request for a copy of records, shall, within 10 days from receipt of the request, determine whether the request, in whole or in part, seeks copies of disclosable public records in the possession of the agency and shall promptly notify the person making the request of the determination and the reasons therefore. In unusual circumstances, the time limit prescribed in this section may be extended by written notice \u2026 to the person making the request, setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for more than 14 days.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis response therefore serves as written notice of the need for an extension of time for your request. The reasons for the extension include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* * The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject matter interest therein. (Govt. Code section 7922.535(c)(3).)\r\n\r\n* \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have initiated the processing of your request to identify records and determine if any records are exempt from disclosure pursuant to Govt.

We aim to have a determination dispatched no later than September 4, 2025, which will inform you of the anticipated date when any disclosable records will be made available to you, the copying charges if physical copies are desired, and the explanation for not disclosing any exempt records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at County of Napa.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nProduct brochures, Powerpoint presentations, flyers and other promotional business documents about defense and technology company Nice Systems Ltd. -- also known as \"NICE\" or \"NICE's Cyber and Intelligence division\" or \"CYBERBIT LTD\" or  \"CYBERBIT\" or \"Elbit Systems Ltd.\" -- describing products and/or services relating to offensive cybersecurity, surveillance, electronic warfare, virtual operations, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The focus of the requests involves product documents that may carry terminology/keywords/descriptions such as: Computer Network Operations (CNO), Computer Network Exploitation (CNE), Computer Network Attacks (CNA), cyber intelligence and signals intelligence (SIGINT). NICE is an Israeli/American technology contractor that sells surveillance and internet monitoring capabilities. The firm has offices around the world, including in the United States, but it is primarily managed from Israel. NICE is known for producing high-tech products for national security and law enforcement agencies to help them conduct surveillance against threats, including terrorism and criminal entities. NICE' cyber and intelligence division was acquired by Elbit Systems Ltd., via a subsidiary called CYBERBIT, in 2015; meaning that references to NICE's technology may carry that name as well, especially more recently. \r\n\r\nThis FOIA seeks any materials produced by the contractor to explain/sell/market their cyber intelligence capabilities/offerings to the U.S. government between the years 2014 and 2020 (or the current date of review). Such material would be likely held/controlled by the appropriate business contracting office within the agency and/or other divisions that make purchase/contracting decisions. NICE/Elbit have tried to sell their products to various different US security organizations in the past.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChristopher Bing\n\n",

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nFiles mentioning or discussing the 1973 CIA personnel reduction in Vietnam described in LOC-HAK-38-3-3-3.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

        "communication": "September 9, 2025\r\nATTN: ASPEN FORD\r\n\r\nHello Aspen-\r\n\r\nThe Chelan County Prosecuting Attorney's Office has completed its search for records in response to your July 11, 2025, public records request you submitted to our office by email to the address of prosecuting.attorney@co.chelan.wa.us (our reference number CCPA-PRR25-21).\r\n\r\nOn July 18, 2025, we provided you with copies of our office's two internal Brady/PID Lists in response to the first part of your request for \"all lists, spreadsheets, or other organized datasets ... created under Brady v. Maryland and/or Giglio v. United States.\"  Because those two lists have since been updated, we are providing you with updated copies of those lists.\r\n\r\nIn our email of July 18, 2025, we also asked if you could clarify the second portion of your request for \"any and all records regarding substantiated allegations of misconduct or violations of internal department policy or criminal law by specific law enforcement officers.\"  On July 23, 2025, you responded with:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  I'm looking for officers both in your local jurisdiction and statewide.\r\n  2.  I'm seeking any records you all maintain, regardless of year.\r\n\r\nOur office has located 114 documents/files (approximately 83 MB) of responsive records to provide you in response to the second portion of your request.  When you and I spoke back in July, you indicated I could upload our responsive records through the link provided with your initial request, which was:\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fchelan-county-prosecuting-attorney-35584%252Fpolice-disciplinary-files-chelan-county-prosecuting-attorney-189437%252F%253Femail%253DProsecuting.Attorney%252540co.chelan.wa.us&url_auth_token=AAGs-YaqqtdwBrm4yCd9Z0Mlj90%3A1ueeqi%3AvvydlMSSSLtvhQHLLK462Qs0c6aZRe7tV_SoMlt6w78\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nLYEUWFWJ\r\nI have clicked on the above link as requested, but I keep receiving this error message:\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DC219B.FE456340]\r\n\r\nSince I cannot access the above site to upload our office's responsive records, I am providing them to you through our secure file transfer protocol, Liquid Files.  The link to access/download the records from Liquid Files is located at the bottom of this email.  (Please note that the Liquid Files link provided at the bottom of this email can ONLY be opened by this email recipient; it cannot be forwarded to another email address.  If there is another email(s) address to which you would like these records sent, please provide me with the other email address(es) and I will be happy to resend this email and Liquid Files link to the other email address(es) provided.)\r\n\r\nNone of the responsive materials being provided by our office have been redacted or determined to be exempt or withheld from disclosure based on statutory exemption.\r\n\r\nOur office believes we have provided all records responsive to your request for public records dated July 11, 2025, and now considers your request fulfilled and closed.  Because this office does not intend to further address your request, we are notifying you that the Public Records Act's one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review pursuant to RCW 42.56.550(6) is now in effect.\r\n\r\nIf you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to contact our office by phone at 509-667-6522 or by email at prosecuting.attorney@co.chelan.wa.us by September 22, 2025.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nCindy\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload Attached Files<https://liquidfiles.co.chelan.wa.us/message/QTbi6cFR6UmiB4jO3hpMnn>\r\n\r\nReply to this Secure Message<https://liquidfiles.co.chelan.wa.us/message/QTbi6cFR6UmiB4jO3hpMnn/reply>\r\n\r\nSecure Message Info\r\n\r\nMessage ID      QTbi6cFR6UmiB4jO3hpMnn\r\nMessage Expires Friday, 10 October\r\nMessage URL     https://liquidfiles.co.chelan.wa.us/message/QTbi6cFR6UmiB4jO3hpMnn\r\nPermission      Only specified recipients can access the files attached to this message.\r\n\r\nFiles attached to this message\r\n\r\nFilename        Size\r\nBrady Notifications.pdf 305 KB\r\nBrady Notifications-Local.pdf   162 KB\r\nCCRJC Deputy Lerma 2016.pdf     495 KB\r\nCCSO Deputy Harris.pdf  14.7 MB\r\nCCSO Deputy Jones 2006.pdf      140 KB\r\nCCSO Deputy Mohns 2008.pdf      2.83 MB\r\nCCSO Deputy Tyler.pdf   3.06 MB\r\nEWPD Officer Hinkle 2014.pdf    3.86 MB\r\nEWPD Officer Sheats 2017.pdf    430 KB\r\nKCSO Former Sgt.

Government Code section 7923.600, subdivision (a) exempts from California Public Records Act disclosure \u201cany investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local police agency, or any investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local agency for correctional, law enforcement, or licensing purposes.\u201d&nbsp;These records are exempt from disclosure, even if the prospect of enforcement proceedings is not concrete and definite.&nbsp;(Haynie v. Superior Court&nbsp;(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1061,1069;&nbsp;Black Panther Party v. Kehoe&nbsp;(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 645, 654;&nbsp;Younger v.

Superior Court&nbsp;(1993) 5&nbsp;Cal.4th 337, 355\u2013362.)&nbsp;Further, the release of such records could violate the privacy rights of involved parties and others named and/or depicted therein.&nbsp;The California Public Records Act recognizes that the right to privacy is a fundamental interest that the California Constitution protects.&nbsp;(Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1; Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7927.700 and 7927.705.)\r\n\r\nFor the reasons outlined above, your request is respectfully denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout waiving the foregoing objections, exemptions, or privileges the Department provides a copy of the press release related to this incident. Duplication costs have been waived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at San Bernardino County.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",
