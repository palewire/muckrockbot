Two incident reports have been uploaded. There are redactions to these reports of personally identifiable information for specifically identified persons, including date of birth, Social Security Numbers, home addresses, and phone numbers.\u00a0 Also, the name and identifying information of a juvenile are redacted under Exemption (a) of the Public Records Law in order to protect the identity of juveniles.\u00a0 Exemption (a) applies to records that are specifically or by necessary implication exempted from disclosure by statute.\u00a0 G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a). \u00a0 A government entity may use the statutory exemption as a basis for withholding requested materials where the exempting statute expressly states or necessarily implies that the public\u2019s right to inspect records under the Public Records Law is restricted.\u00a0 Att\u2019y Gen. v. Collector of Lynn, 377 Mass. 151, 154 (1979); Ottaway Newspapers, Inc. v. Appeals Court, 372 Mass. 539, 545-46 (1977).\u00a0 This exemption establishes two categories of exempted records.\u00a0 The first category consists of records that are expressly exempt from disclosure by statute where the language of the statute will provide that such record \"shall not be a public record\" or have similar language referring to the confidentiality of the record.\u00a0 The second category under the exemption includes records deemed exempt under statute by necessary implication.\u00a0 G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a). \r\nThe Department redacted the name of the juvenile under the second category where records are exempted by necessary implication pursuant to G.L. c. 41 \u00a7 98F which expressly provides that entries on police logs concerning arrests of a person under the age of 18 shall be kept separately, shall not be a public record nor shall such entry be disclosed to the public.\u00a0 See G.L. c. 41 ss.98F.\u00a0 While the record you are seeking is not an entry in the daily police log, it does relate to an arrest of a juvenile; therefore, by necessary implication, this information is not public and the Department redacted information relating to the juvenile. The Department located body-worn camera videos from 1:34 AM to 2:26 AM, totaling 228 hours.\u00a0 However, the Department is denying this portion of your request pursuant to the investigatory exemption to the public records law because the records you seek are related to an ongoing open investigation, and their release at this time will prejudice effective law enforcement. \u00a0 A records custodian may withhold records concerning investigatory materials necessarily compiled out of public view by law enforcement officials where the disclosure of such materials would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that releasing the records is not in the public interest. See G. L.\u00a0 c.4,\u00a0 \u00a7 7(26) (f). \r\nThe Department recognizes that exemption (f) does not create a blanket exemption of all investigative materials created and maintained by police departments. See Dist. Attorney for the Norfolk Dist. v. Flatley, 419 Mass. 507, 512 (1995) ; WBZ-TV4 v. Dist. Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., 408 Mass. 595, 603 (1990) .\u00a0 Exemption (f) does not exempt all investigatory materials but rather requires a case-by-case analysis of whether disclosure would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that releasing the records is not in the public interest. See Reinstein v. Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, 378 Mass. 281, 289-90 (1979) . \r\nUnder the public records law, there is a presumption that the record sought is public, and the burden is on the custodian to prove with specificity how the exemption applies.\u00a0 G. L.\u00a0 c. 66\u00a0 \u00a710 (c).\u00a0 Records custodians may withhold records relating to an ongoing investigation if the release of such records would disclose confidential investigative techniques, procedures or sources of information. See Bougas v. Chief of Police of Lexington, 371 Mass. 59, 354 N.E.2d 872 (1976) .\u00a0 An essential part of the investigatory process includes a dialogue between police departments, individual citizens, and potential witnesses.\u00a0 Exemption (f) contemplates that individual citizens should be encouraged to come forward and speak freely with police concerning matters under investigation and the creation of initiative that police officers might be completely candid in recording their observations, hypotheses, and interim conclusions. Id . \r\nThe Department denies your request because the records are part of open Internal Affairs Department (IAD) investigations and criminal proceedings; disclosure will prejudice future law enforcement efforts for the reasons stated below.\u00a0 Disclosure of the requested records would interfere with enforcement proceedings.\u00a0 The body-worn camera videos are part of the investigation of this incident. Disclosure would prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that such disclosure is not in the public interest.\u00a0 Disclosure would prejudice effective law enforcement because officers and other prospective witnesses have not been interviewed. Disclosure would disclose confidential investigative techniques, procedures, or sources of information.\u00a0 Disclosure could inhibit the investigatory process by discouraging potential witnesses from coming forward or influencing witness statements. \u00a0 Encouraging citizens and prospective witnesses to come forward and speak with police and allowing the police department to establish trust with the community are essential elements of the investigatory process and effective law enforcement.\u00a0 Without this collaborative component, investigations will become more difficult.\u00a0 The collaboration between the public and the police and encouraging the public to cooperate with police investigations are reasons contemplated by the investigatory exemption.\u00a0 The investigatory process will be hampered if prospective witnesses do not come forward.\u00a0 Such a result will prejudice future law enforcement efforts and the possibility of effective law enforcement, which is not in the public interest.\u00a0 Further, releasing this record at this time may influence potential witnesses, thereby compromising the investigatory process.\u00a0 The Department is denying your request to protect the integrity of the investigative process and information relating to confidential investigative techniques, procedures, and sources and to maintain the ability to foster cooperation with the public.\u00a0 These records are part of an ongoing investigation, and their disclosure would prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement; therefore, disclosure of the requested record is not in the public interest.\u00a0 Disclosure of this record would also have a chilling effect on future law enforcement efforts. \r\nA records custodian is obligated to provide segregable portions of records where possible. See Globe Newspaper Co. v. Exec. Office of Admin. and Fin. , Suffolk Sup. No. 11-01184- A (June 14, 2013).\u00a0 However, providing segregable portions of the requested records is impossible without revealing confidential investigative techniques, procedures, or sources of information . Withholding this record is necessary to prevent interference with enforcement proceedings.\u00a0 The disclosure would prejudice effective law enforcement and not be in the public interest.\u00a0 Once the IAD investigation and criminal investigations are concluded, the Department may reevaluate its position if you wish to make another public records request. \r\nYou may appeal this response to the Supervisor of Records in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10A (c); G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(b)(ix); 950 CMR 32.08; 950 CMR 32.08(1)(h) (in petitioning the Supervisor, the requester shall provide a copy of such petition to the records access officer associated with such petition). You may also appeal to the Superior Court. 950 CMR 32.06(3)(c).  Sincerely, \r\nChristine O\u2019Donnell Assistant Corporation Counsel Office of the Legal Advisor Boston Police Department",

Four-hundred twenty-four responsive emails are redacted to omit personally identifiable information for specifically identified persons, including names, date of birth, Social Security Numbers, home addresses, and phone numbers.\u00a0 Such portions are deemed intimate details of a highly personal nature.\u00a0 The public interest in disclosure does not outweigh the privacy interest these individuals hold.\u00a0 The information is not available from another public source. G. L.\u00a0 c.4,\u00a0 \u00a7 7(26) (c). Fifteen responsive email records consist of attorney-client privileged communications. Suffolk Const. Co., Inc. v. Division of Capital Asset Management , 449 Mass. 444 (2007). These records shall be withheld entirely.\u00a0 A records custodian must satisfy a three-part test in establishing the attorney-client privilege. See  Suffolk Constr. Co. v. Div. of Capital Asset Mgmt. , 449 Mass. 444 (2007); see also SPR18/423 Determination of the Supervisor of Records (April 11, 2018).\u00a0 The Suffolk Court\u2019s holding imposes a burden on a records custodian of \u201cnot only proving the existence of an attorney-client relationship but also (1) that the communications were received from a client during the client\u2019s search for legal advice from the attorney in his capacity as such; (2) that the communications were made in confidence; and (3) that the privilege as to these communications has not been waived.\u201d See SPR18/423 (April 11, 2018), p2.\u00a0 The withheld records consist solely of communications between City employees and their attorneys.

Forty-five responsive emails consist of information associated with open Boston Police Department Internal Affairs Department (IAD) investigations and criminal proceedings.\u00a0 These records shall be withheld entirely.\u00a0\u00a0The release will prejudice effective law enforcement. Records custodians may withhold records under the investigatory exemption relating to an ongoing investigation if the release of such records would disclose confidential investigative techniques, procedures, or sources of information. See G. L.\u00a0 c.4,\u00a0 \u00a7 7(26) (f); Bougas v. Chief of Police of Lexington, 371 Mass. 59, 354 N.E.2d 872 (1976) .\u00a0 An essential part of the investigatory process includes a dialogue between police departments, individual citizens, and potential witnesses.\u00a0 Exemption (f) contemplates that individual citizens should be encouraged to come forward and speak freely with police concerning matters under investigation and the creation of an initiative that police officers might be completely candid in recording their observations, hypotheses, and interim conclusions. Id Two incident reports have been uploaded. There are redactions to these reports of personally identifiable information for specifically identified persons, including date of birth, Social Security Numbers, home addresses, and phone numbers.\u00a0 Also, the name and identifying information of a juvenile are redacted under Exemption (a) of the Public Records Law in order to protect the identity of juveniles.\u00a0 Exemption (a) applies to records that are specifically or by necessary implication exempted from disclosure by statute.\u00a0 G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a). \u00a0 A government entity may use the statutory exemption as a basis for withholding requested materials where the exempting statute expressly states or necessarily implies that the public\u2019s right to inspect records under the Public Records Law is restricted.\u00a0 Att\u2019y Gen. v. Collector of Lynn, 377 Mass. 151, 154 (1979); Ottaway Newspapers, Inc. v. Appeals Court, 372 Mass. 539, 545-46 (1977).\u00a0 This exemption establishes two categories of exempted records.\u00a0 The first category consists of records that are expressly exempt from disclosure by statute where the language of the statute will provide that such record \"shall not be a public record\" or have similar language referring to the confidentiality of the record.\u00a0 The second category under the exemption includes records deemed exempt under statute by necessary implication.\u00a0 G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a). \r\nThe Department redacted the name of the juvenile under the second category where records are exempted by necessary implication pursuant to G.L. c. 41 \u00a7 98F which expressly provides that entries on police logs concerning arrests of a person under the age of 18 shall be kept separately, shall not be a public record nor shall such entry be disclosed to the public.\u00a0 See G.L. c. 41 ss.98F.\u00a0 While the record you are seeking is not an entry in the daily police log, it does relate to an arrest of a juvenile; therefore, by necessary implication, this information is not public and the Department redacted information relating to the juvenile. \r\nThe Department located body-worn camera videos from 1:34 AM to 2:26 AM, totaling 228 hours.\u00a0 However, the Department is denying your request pursuant to the investigatory exemption to the public records law because the records you seek are related to an ongoing open investigation, and their release at this time will prejudice effective law enforcement. \u00a0 A records custodian may withhold records concerning investigatory materials necessarily compiled out of public view by law enforcement officials where the disclosure of such materials would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that releasing the records is not in the public interest. See G. L.\u00a0 c.4,\u00a0 \u00a7 7(26) (f). \r\nThe Department recognizes that exemption (f) does not create a blanket exemption of all investigative materials created and maintained by police departments. See Dist. Attorney for the Norfolk Dist. v. Flatley, 419 Mass. 507, 512 (1995) ; WBZ-TV4 v. Dist. Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., 408 Mass. 595, 603 (1990) .\u00a0 Exemption (f) does not exempt all investigatory materials but rather requires a case-by-case analysis of whether disclosure would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that releasing the records is not in the public interest. See Reinstein v. Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, 378 Mass. 281, 289-90 (1979) . \r\nUnder the public records law, there is a presumption that the record sought is public, and the burden is on the custodian to prove with specificity how the exemption applies.\u00a0 G. L.\u00a0 c. 66\u00a0 \u00a710 (c).\u00a0 Records custodians may withhold records relating to an ongoing investigation if the release of such records would disclose confidential investigative techniques, procedures or sources of information. See Bougas v. Chief of Police of Lexington, 371 Mass. 59, 354 N.E.2d 872 (1976) .\u00a0 An essential part of the investigatory process includes a dialogue between police departments, individual citizens, and potential witnesses.\u00a0 Exemption (f) contemplates that individual citizens should be encouraged to come forward and speak freely with police concerning matters under investigation and the creation of initiative that police officers might be completely candid in recording their observations, hypotheses, and interim conclusions. Id . \r\nThe Department denies this portion of your request because the records are part of open Internal Affairs Department (IAD) investigations and criminal proceedings; disclosure will prejudice future law enforcement efforts for the reasons stated below.\u00a0 Disclosure of the requested records would interfere with enforcement proceedings.\u00a0 The body-worn camera videos are part of the investigation of this incident. Disclosure would prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that such disclosure is not in the public interest.\u00a0 Disclosure would prejudice effective law enforcement because officers and other prospective witnesses have not been interviewed. Disclosure would disclose confidential investigative techniques, procedures, or sources of information.\u00a0 Disclosure could inhibit the investigatory process by discouraging potential witnesses from coming forward or influencing witness statements. \u00a0 Encouraging citizens and prospective witnesses to come forward and speak with police and allowing the police department to establish trust with the community are essential elements of the investigatory process and effective law enforcement.\u00a0 Without this collaborative component, investigations will become more difficult.\u00a0 The collaboration between the public and the police and encouraging the public to cooperate with police investigations are reasons contemplated by the investigatory exemption.\u00a0 The investigatory process will be hampered if prospective witnesses do not come forward.\u00a0 Such a result will prejudice future law enforcement efforts and the possibility of effective law enforcement, which is not in the public interest.\u00a0 Further, releasing this record at this time may influence potential witnesses, thereby compromising the investigatory process.\u00a0 The Department is denying your request to protect the integrity of the investigative process and information relating to confidential investigative techniques, procedures, and sources and to maintain the ability to foster cooperation with the public.\u00a0 These records are part of an ongoing investigation, and their disclosure would prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement; therefore, disclosure of the requested record is not in the public interest.\u00a0 Disclosure of this record would also have a chilling effect on future law enforcement efforts. \r\nA records custodian is obligated to provide segregable portions of records where possible. See Globe Newspaper Co. v. Exec. Office of Admin. and Fin. , Suffolk Sup. No. 11-01184- A (June 14, 2013).\u00a0 However, providing segregable portions of the requested records is impossible without revealing confidential investigative techniques, procedures, or sources of information . Withholding this record is necessary to prevent interference with enforcement proceedings.\u00a0 The disclosure would prejudice effective law enforcement and not be in the public interest. Once the IAD and criminal investigations are concluded, the Department may reevaluate its position if you wish to make another public records request. \r\nYou may appeal this response to the Supervisor of Records in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10A (c); G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(b)(ix); 950 CMR 32.08; 950 CMR 32.08(1)(h) (in petitioning the Supervisor, the requester shall provide a copy of such petition to the records access officer associated with such petition). You may also appeal to the Superior Court. 950 CMR 32.06(3)(c). Yours truly, Christine O'Donnell Assistant Corporation Counsel Office of the Legal Advisor Boston Police Department",

Div. of Capital Asset Mgmt. , 449 Mass. 444 (2007); see also SPR18/423 Determination of the Supervisor of Records (April 11, 2018).\u00a0 The Suffolk Court\u2019s holding imposes a burden on a records custodian of \u201cnot only proving the existence of an attorney-client relationship but also (1) that the communications were received from a client during the client\u2019s search for legal advice from the attorney in his capacity as such; (2) that the communications were made in confidence; and (3) that the privilege as to these communications has not been waived.\u201d See SPR18/423 (April 11, 2018), p2.\u00a0 The withheld records consist solely of communications between City employees and their attorneys. Such records contain information between an attorney and client related to \u201cthe client\u2019s search for legal advice from the attorney in his capacity as such.\u201d All of these communications \u201cwere made in confidence.\u201d\u00a0 In all cases \u201cthe privilege as to these communications has not been waived.\u201d\u00a0 The Client is the City of Boston. Forty-five responsive emails consist of information associated with open Boston Police Department Internal Affairs Department (IAD) investigations and criminal proceedings.\u00a0 These records shall be withheld entirely.\u00a0\u00a0The release will prejudice effective law enforcement. Records custodians may withhold records under the investigatory exemption relating to an ongoing investigation if the release of such records would disclose confidential investigative techniques, procedures, or sources of information. See G. L.\u00a0 c.4,\u00a0 \u00a7 7(26) (f); Bougas v. Chief of Police of Lexington, 371 Mass. 59, 354 N.E.2d 872 (1976) .\u00a0 An essential part of the investigatory process includes a dialogue between police departments, individual citizens, and potential witnesses.\u00a0 Exemption (f) contemplates that individual citizens should be encouraged to come forward and speak freely with police concerning matters under investigation and the creation of an initiative that police officers might be completely candid in recording their observations, hypotheses, and interim conclusions. Id Two incident reports have been uploaded.  There are redactions to these reports of under Exemption (a) of the Public Records Law in order to protect the identity of juveniles.\u00a0 Exemption\u00a0(a) applies to records that are specifically or by necessary implication exempted from disclosure by statute.\u00a0 G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a).\u00a0 \u00a0A government entity may use the statutory exemption as a basis for withholding requested materials where the exempting statute expressly states or necessarily implies that the public\u2019s right to inspect records under the Public Records Law is restricted.\u00a0\u00a0Att\u2019y Gen. v. Collector of Lynn, 377 Mass. 151, 154 (1979); Ottaway Newspapers, Inc. v. Appeals Court, 372 Mass. 539, 545-46 (1977).\u00a0 This exemption establishes two categories of exempted records.\u00a0 The first category consists of records that are expressly exempt from disclosure by statute where the language of the statute will provide that such record \"shall not be a public record\" or have similar language\u00a0referring to the confidentiality of the record.\u00a0 The second category under the exemption includes records deemed exempt under statute by necessary implication.\u00a0 G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a). personally identifiable information for specifically identified persons, including date of birth, Social Security Numbers, home addresses, and phone numbers.\u00a0 Also, the name and identifying information of a juvenile are redacted \r\nThe Department redacted the name of the juvenile under the second category where records are exempted by necessary implication pursuant to G.L. c. 41 \u00a7 98F which expressly provides that entries on police logs concerning arrests of a person under the age of 18 shall be kept\u00a0separately, shall not be a public record nor shall such entry be disclosed to the public.\u00a0 See G.L. c. 41 ss.98F.\u00a0 While the record you are seeking is not an entry in the daily police log, it does relate to an arrest of a juvenile; therefore, by necessary implication, this information is not public and the Department redacted information relating to the juvenile. \r\nYou may appeal this response to the Supervisor of Records in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10A (c); G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(b)(ix); 950 CMR 32.08; 950 CMR 32.08(1)(h) (in petitioning the Supervisor, the requester shall provide a copy of such petition to the records access officer associated with such petition). You may also appeal to the Superior Court. 950 CMR 32.06(3)(c). Yours truly, Christine O'Donnell Assistant Corporation Counsel Office of the Legal Advisor Boston Police Department",

DSHS, 193 Wn. App. 377 (2016), holds that when a city receives a request for documents that includes a list of individuals, the City is required to determine whether the list will be used for \u201ccommercial purposes.\u201d The case concluded that a requestor has a commercial purpose if the requestor intends to use the list for direct or indirect profit-making activity, regardless of whether the requestor intends to contact the individuals on the list or even if the individuals are personally affected by the release of the list or not. If the City has some indication that a requester intends to use a list of individuals for a commercial purpose, we are required to \u201cinvestigate further\u201d before we disclose that list. \r\n\r\nFurther, the SEIU case held that even an affirmation stating that any responsive records received for a request which include lists of individuals will not be used for commercial purposes, is not sufficient.\u00a0 Instead, before we can release the records providing City salary information, we are required to obtain from you sufficient details as to what you intend to use the list for so that we can make an independent evaluation as to whether or not your purpose is commercial or not. \r\n\r\nPlease fill out and return the attached Commercial Purpose Declaration. A determination will then be made as to whether your stated purpose regarding the use of the list(s) of individuals contained in any compiled responsive records is sufficient to allow for the release of this information. To avoid unnecessary delay in obtaining these specific responsive records for your request, please return the completed declaration at your earliest opportunity. We will follow up with you within five business days as to the validity of the stated purpose relating to your request. \r\nPlease complete and return the Commercial Purpose Declaration within 30 days of today's date, or by February 8, 2024.\u00a0 If a completed declaration determined to be valid is not received in the City Clerk's Office by that date, your request will be considered concluded and closed, and a new request will be required in this matter after February 8. \r\nAs I advised above, we anticipate responsive records will be available on or about January 26, 2024, contingent upon the receipt of a completed declaration determined to be valid to show that records provided under this request containing lists of individuals will not be used for commercial purposes. \r\nSincerely, \r\nLaurie Farnsworth \r\nSpokane Deputy City Clerk",

Proof of death is not required as his date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 360 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,",

State and local agencies that spent less than $100,000 may voluntarily submit reports (RCW 40.14.026(5)).\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2021.

The most recent public records should be produced first. \r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\nPlease provide all electronic records in their native electronic format. Please do not create new records by printing native electronic files then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints for electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST.

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington.

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

If this is the case, I assume that you mean to claim that all responsive records are considered exempt by the City under RCW 42.56.240(4), which covers security information such as passwords, access codes, security plans, etc.\r\n\r\nAre you claiming that even the knowledge of the city's usage of basic software, such as Microsoft Word or Outlook, would risk the security of the city? Because that could only mean to me that the City has set up a very insecure, perhaps negligent, security environment. In fact, other MuckRock requesters have been provided similar records from the City of Seattle (see https://www.muckrock.com/foi/seattle-69/seattle-police-itd-authorized-software-department-of-information-technology-101093/).\r\n\r\nMay I remind you that the Washington Public Records Act RCW 42.56.030 is to be \"liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed\". I respectfully ask that I be provided with the full breadth of the requested information and will be considering my options for asserting my rights under the PRA.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRose",

Again, I must reiterate from my last message that the security of City hardware cannot possibly depend on withholding the names of hardware such as computer monitors etc in the City's inventory. According to guidelines written by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), \"[s]ystem security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its components.\" (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-123.pdf) On the other hand, there is a significant public interest to know what hardware the City has acquired with taxpayer money and how it is being operated.\r\n\r\nIf there is a particular device where even knowing of its existence would threaten City security, that device should be individually redacted rather than withholding the full file. I do not consider this response to be adequate and again ask that you provide the full breadth of the requested records.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRose",

Personally identifiable information, including names, home address, telephone numbers, photographs, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, and other serialized numerical identifications not directly associated with system for tracking records in the criminal case, that relate to any victims, victims' family members, and/or witnesses or their family members that are non-law enforcement or public agency personnel, acting in a professional fashion directly related to the case, have been redacted or undisclosed out of a precaution for their privacy and safety, as applicable, pursuant to public policy which is illustrated in the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act and the Information Practices Act as well as the First and Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article 1 of the California Constitution.  In particular to this case, there is a very high likelihood of organized criminal activity discussed in relation to these circumstances which greatly increased the risk of harm to all of these category of individuals. Photographs of any dead bodies have been redacted pursuant to public policy which is illustrated through Code of Civil Procedure Section 129.  Additionally, references to juvenile records have been redacted as a matter of public policy which is illustrated through Welfare and Institution Code Section 825 et. seq. Although some of the content referenced in the previous two sentences are so inextricably intertwined in the original file that it would not normally be released at all, they have been included here entirely redacted to allow for a better understand of the documents considered in the report which is a record this request seeks based on Penal Code Section 832.7.  In this way, the intent of SB1421 to allow for public review of the law enforcement agency's oversight of officer conduct is achieved.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. The law states, Section 24-72-205 (5) (a), C.R.S., (a) A custodian may charge a fee not to exceed twenty-five cents per standard page for a copy of a public record or a fee not to exceed the actual cost of providing a copy, printout, or photograph of a public record in a format other than a standard page; except that a custodian shall not charge a per-page fee for providing records in a digital or electronic format. \r\n2. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff. Please provide a quantitative list of the time involved and the staff who performed the tasks.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

They have been pleased to discover that MuckRock payments are a charity based organization, therefore they are apparently tax deductible. We are all scratching our heads about the 90 day lapse in response on this request, so perhaps your system had issues as well.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPlease consider this a formal appeal pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act regarding FOIA 22-00098-R, that seeks:\r\n\r\n\"Any and all records pertaining to Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP), also known as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO). This request seeks all responsive records, including but not limited to, emails, photographs, slide presentations, digital images, and any and all other responsive documents. The time frame for this request should include all responsive records dated from December 1, 2017 up to and including January 2, 2022.\r\n\r\nPlease include all processing notes attached to my request.\"\r\n\r\nI am challenging the adequacy of the DOE's search on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n1) The agency seemingly did not perform searches in all locations or offices that may contain responsive records; if an agency does not search locations that may hold responsive records, the thoroughness of a records search can be called into question. (Defenders of Wildlife v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 314 F. Supp.2d 1, 13-14, D.D.C. 2004; Nat'l REs. Def. Council v. U.S. Dep't of Def., 388 F. Supp. 2d. 1086, 1100-1101, C.D. Cal. 2005.) I respectfully ask that the DOE conduct a new, complete, and thorough search for responsive records in the following locations: Office of the Secretary; Office of the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security (SS) and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA); Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, & Emergency Response (CESER); Chief & Associate Administrator for Defense Nuclear Security (NA-70); Artificial Intelligence & Technology Office (AI); and the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E). Please conduct searches of all electronic and paper/manual indices, filing systems, main file records, cross-reference records, and all other relevant locations. If the DOE declines to search these locations, I will file a new request including them.\r\n\r\n2) The DOE did not provide any processing notes as originally requested. Please also include with DOE's response to this appeal any and all associated processing notes. If processing notes are not included, I will file an additional FOIA request seeking them.\r\n\r\n3) Finally, an agency \"has a duty to construe a FOIA request liberally,\" and because of this requesters \"need not utilize the precise jargon employed by agency officials\" in FOIA requests. (Nation Magazine v. U.S. Customs Serv., 71 F.3d 885, 890, D.C. Cir. 1995). As such, I respectfully ask that the DOE interpret this request and appeal as broadly as possible.\r\n\r\nBefore litigating this matter, I am open to mediation through the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), if necessary.\r\n\r\nI greatly appreciate a response to this administrative appeal within 20 business days, as the statute requires. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions concerning this appeal. Thank you very much for your time and attention in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDustin M. Slaughter",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Free: This correspondence is in response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request 2019-53072, remanded by the Office of Information Policy and assigned new FOIA number 2022-31598. A search was conducted and one or more records responsive to your request were located. We are granting partial access to the responsive record(s). Portions of the enclosed records have been redacted in accordance with FOIA Exemption 5, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5), which concerns certain inter- and intra-agency communications protected by the deliberative process privilege, attorney work-product doctrine and/or the attorney-client privilege. Additionally, portions of the enclosed records have been redacted in accordance with FOIA Exemption 6, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6), which concerns material the release of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. Additional documents were located with equities belonging to the Office of the Attorney General or subordinate Offices.\u00a0 Per Departmental policy, these documents were referred to the Office for Information Policy and the Justice Management Division for direct response to you. For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c) (2006 & Supp. IV 2010). This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. See http://www.justice.gov/oip/foiapost/2012foiapost9.html. \nYou may contact the EOIR FOIA Public Liaison by e-mail at EOIR.FOIARequests@USDOJ.GOV or by telephone number (703) 605-1297 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request. Please reference the FOIA control number. Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at (877) 684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769. If you are not satisfied with the Executive Office for Immigration Review\u2019s determination in response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP\u2019s FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website: https://www.justice.gov/oip/submit-and-track-request-or-appeal.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of this response to your request. If you submit your appeal by mail, both the correspondence and the envelope should be clearly marked \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal.\u201d \n\nSincerely, \n\nJoseph Schaaf \nSupervisory Attorney Advisor (FOIA)",

This happens a lot when dealing with long e-mail strings or multiple versions of the same e-mail string.  To redact the same e-mail within strings, we have to manually review the e-mail each time, and then go back and compare the redactions to make sure they are consistent.\r\n\r\nWhen we use the \u201cduplicate\u201d marking, we are still releasing the responsive record, just not multiple times, greatly speeding the delivery of responsive documents.  The redacted e-mail should be the first instance of that e-mail you see in multiple e-mail strings.\r\n\r\nIf you have received a record marked \u201cduplicate\u201d and cannot find the redacted version, don\u2019t hesitate to let us know and we will address it.   Again, thanks for reaching out on this.\r\n\nJoseph Schaaf\r\nSupervisory Attorney (FOIA)",

Cassidy, Stuart V. Couch, Earle B. Wilson, and Keith E. Hunsucker  Assigned JMD FOIA TRACKING NUMBER: 128063  Dear Mr. Free:  This is to acknowledge that while processing your Freedom of Information Act request dated 9/16/2019 concerning the subject referenced above, the Executive Office for Immigration Review referred matters that are of primary interest to the Justice Management Division (JMD) for processing and direct response to you. The referral was received by JMD FOIA on 5/10/2022 and assigned the JMD tracking number identified above.  For your records, the Executive Office for Immigration Review identifying tracking number was 2022-31598.  The Justice Management Division assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited. Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track. Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month whereas complex requests necessarily take longer. At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track. Please note that as a general matter, records in the Department are decentralized and our response will only cover information originating with or relating to JMD. If you are seeking information originating with or relating to other components of the Department, please make a FOIA request directly to those components.  If you have a question about the status of your FOIA request, you may contact this office by sending an email to JMDfoia@usdoj.gov or by calling 202-514-3101 during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Eastern Time, excluding federal holidays.)  Please refer to the JMD FOIA TRACKING NUMBER whenever you contact the Department regarding this request.  Sincerely,  Karen E. McFadden FOIA Contact Justice Management Division\n",

The FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard. The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances. Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. Please be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be significant delay in the processing of your request. EOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities. Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records. Your request has been placed in track three for complex requests. If you have filed an application for a fee waiver, EOIR will address your request in a separate letter. Additionally, if you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. If you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at (703) 605-1297 to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request. Alternatively, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at (877) 684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

Please read this email in its entirety for important information about upcoming improvements to the EOIR Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) request process.\r\n\r\nAs of December 1, 2022, EOIR no longer accepts FOIA or PA requests by email. EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request a ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request a ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit a ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request a ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting a ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>\n",

Please ensure the email address you provided in PAL will be able to receive the messages we send you. Messages rejected by your email account will not be rerouted to you \nPlease be aware that EOIR is a component of the Department of Justice and the custodian of records for the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (ROP), which is the compilation of documents and digital audio recordings produced in proceedings before the immigration courts and the BIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the custodian of records for the \u201cA-file,\u201d which is a series of records of a person\u2019s immigration history and is maintained and stored by DHS. EOIR is not the custodian of records for DHS or its components, nor does EOIR have access to DHS\u2019s A-files . EOIR does not create an ROP until matters are initiated by DHS. Nevertheless, EOIR may create and maintain ROPs for proceedings other than removal proceedings (i.e., credible fear reviews, bond hearings). You may request a copy of your Notice to Appear (NTA) and full A-file from DHS (https://www.dhs.gov/foia) \nNote that parties to immigration cases (including respondents and their representatives of record) have the option to request their Record of Proceedings directly from the immigration court or Board of Immigration Appeals. Please see the instructions here: https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest. (https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest) \nPlease be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be significant delay in the processing of your request. \nIf you have filed a fee waiver request, EOIR will address the fee waiver in a separate letter. Most requests for records of proceedings do not require any fees; however, if the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed $25.00, EOIR will notify you before processing the request to determine whether you will commit to paying the fee or whether you wish to narrow the scope of your request to reduce the fee. Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.\u00a0 Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records.\u00a0 As a matter of default, your request has been placed in track two for simple requests.\u00a0 If you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. \nIf you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at (703) 605-1297 or EOIR.FOIArequests@usdoj.gov to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request. Alternatively, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at (877) 684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769. \n \nSincerely, \nFOIA Intake\n",

We appeal in the hopes of not needing to wait to resolve several clearly erroneous redactions.  \r\n\r\nFirst, there is no such thing as a \u201cnon-responsive\u201d record WITHIN a responsive record. And there is no \u201cnon-responsive\u201d withholding in 5 USC 552(b). Please remove \u201cnon-responsive\u201d designations. \r\n\r\nSecond, this is no \u201cduplicate\u201d FOIA exemption in 5 USC 555(b). Please unredact the \u201cduplicate\u201d block redactions. \r\n\r\nThird, there is no legitimate Exemption 5 claim in the memoranda from James McHenry to the DAG recommending appoint of IJs, and no specific, foreseeable harm articulated. Please remove the 5 redactions from these memos. \r\n\r\nFourth, referrals to other components or agencies are supposed to happen at the earliest possible stage. The JMD Referrals are an unlawful withholding under McGehee. Please release these withheld, referred materials or provide an estimated date on which the referral will be completed. \r\n\r\nFourth, there is no valid Exemption 6 claim in these emails because they are not \u201cmedical, personnel, or similar files.\u201d  They are, to point out the obvious, emails. Moreover, there is no privacy basis to blanket-redact these DOJ officials\u2019 email addresses, as they are not law enforcement officials, but public servants. Please remove the b6 redactions from email addresses. \r\n\r\nWe reserve all other challenges until the completion of production, and will withdraw this appeal if we can secure an agreement addressing the concerns above.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Daniel Ellsberg. Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

I see that in the reply that contains these previously released documents, additional records that are responsive to my request exist. I am writing to confirm within the allotted thirty day window that this material does not satisfy my request as most of the documents are more than forty years old, and many are much older. I understand that Dr. Daniel Ellsberg continued to be of interest to the FBI long after the early 1980s. I request that the additional records about my requested subject be processed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in this matter.",

In this regard, I would like to point out that my request specifically referenced a quote from Dr. James McDonald, Commissioner of Health. Therefore, I suggest beginning the search for responsive documents with Dr. McDonald and his office, including any communications and materials presented to him regarding the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is crucial to include records from external parties who have provided information to the Health Commissioner that influenced his public health recommendations. This includes, but is not limited to, data or studies that support the assertion that vaccination can prevent individuals from being \u201csick for the holidays,\u201d especially considering the biological variability among individuals and the time required to develop immunity.\r\n\r\nGiven the public interest in understanding the basis for health recommendations made by state officials, I urge a thorough and expedient review of relevant documents. Please consider this letter as a clarification to my initial FOIL request, focusing on Dr. McDonald\u2019s office and related external communications.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and the timely processing of my request.",

These records are crucial, as they have contributed to the Health Commissioner\u2019s public health recommendations. Specifically, I am seeking data or studies provided by these external entities that support the assertion that vaccination can prevent individuals from being \u201csick for the holidays.\u201d This request is particularly focused on understanding the biological variability among individuals and the time required to develop immunity post-vaccination.\r\n\r\nMy request encompasses:\r\n\r\nStatistical data, studies, or reports from January 1, 2023, to December 6, 2023, demonstrating the COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness.\r\nComparative analysis of infection rates, hospitalizations, and fatality rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups in New York State.\r\nRecords from external parties influencing the Health Commissioner's public health recommendations, including data or studies on vaccine efficacy in relation to individual biological variability and immunity development.\r\n\r\nGiven the public interest and the ongoing public health guidelines, timely access to this comprehensive set of information is essential.\r\n\r\nPlease inform me if any further details or clarifications are needed from my side to expedite the processing of my request.

While I appreciate the complexities involved in such a request, the extended timeline for completion, now projected to be March 19, 2024, raises significant concerns.\r\n\r\nThe urgency of this request stems not only from its public health implications but also from the need to understand the basis for public health recommendations that seemingly do not account for individual biological variability. The statements made by public health officials, which prompted this FOIL request, suggest a one-size-fits-all approach to vaccine efficacy, which may not adequately consider the diverse responses of individuals to the vaccine.\r\n\r\nGiven the potential impact of these recommendations on public understanding and decision-making, it is imperative that any data or communications used to formulate these recommendations be made available promptly. Therefore, I request a rolling release of documents as they are identified and reviewed. This approach will facilitate timely public access to information that is crucial for informed discourse and decision-making.\r\n\r\nI urge you to prioritize the release of any documents that have already been identified, even if the search and review process for the entire request is ongoing. The provision of this information in a timely manner is essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring that health recommendations are based on a comprehensive understanding of the data.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt response and the expedited release of the identified documents.",

This delay undermines the principles of transparency and accountability, especially given the public health implications of the information sought.\r\n\r\nPursuant to New York Public Officers Law \u00a789(4)(a), I am appealing the implicit denial resulting from the failure to provide the requested records within the statutory timeframe. The ongoing delays fail to comply with the timely access envisioned by FOIL, and there has been no justification for such extensive delays that would outweigh the public interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nI kindly request a review of this decision and timely access to the requested records. If this appeal is denied, please provide a written explanation, including the statutory exemptions relied upon for denying access to these records.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.",

Proof of death is not required as his date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This includes A) any notes taken during meetings that discussed ChatGPT and B) Any other documents related to ChatGPT including internal documentation, public relations materials, and executive summaries.\r\n\r\n2) Any memos or communications sent to schools, administrators, teachers, parents, or students that mention \"ChatGPT.\"\r\n\r\n3) Any case studies, enforcement actions, contracts, or other documents mentioning ChatGPT \r\n\r\n4) Any academic dishonesty policies that mention ChatGPT\r\n\r\n5) To the extent possible, any emails and associated attachments that mention ChatGPT\r\n\r\nTo help limit the extent of the responsive documents, please limit search from Jan 1, 2023 through the time this request is processed. Please deliver these documents on a rolling basis as responsive documents are found. You can treat #5 (emails) as a separate request because I suspect there will be many more responsive documents there.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. It will be used in the course of reporting for Motherboard, VICE's science and tech site (www.motherboard.vice.com).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJason Koebler",

Your request was forwarded from the Department of Veterans Affairs\r\nand received in this office on May 28, 2024, and assigned case number\r\n24-43958.\r\n\r\nThe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is the repository\r\nfor the permanent and historically valuable records of the United States\r\nFederal Government, which includes those of the U.S. Congress, the U.S.\r\nSupreme Court and federal court system, and the agencies and departments of\r\nthe Executive Branch. Our holdings are not organized by name or subject,\r\nbut are primarily arranged by the federal office or court that created and\r\nmaintained the records, and thereafter by various filing schemes depending\r\non the type of record or the particular function of the federal office or\r\ncourt in question. Moreover, it is important to note that NARA does not\r\nhave a master name and subject index that identifies all documents\r\npertaining to a specific individual, organization, topic, or geographic\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nWith regards to your request, the Archives 1 Reference Branch in\r\nWashington, DC, houses numerous records relating to the Civil War and\r\nincludes records relating to military service. However, we should note that\r\nthe War Department did not create any consolidated personnel files during\r\nthe Civil War, and as such, there is no personnel file for Mary Edwards\r\nWalker. But we checked the Records of the Adjutant General\u2019s Office (Record\r\nGroup 94) and noted the following records are available for Mary Edwards\r\nWalker:\r\n\r\n   - File in the series \u201cPersonal Papers of Medical Officers and\r\n   Physicians\u201d (PI-17 Entry 561; National Archives Identifier 655782\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/655782>) -- 221 pages\r\n   - File W-2068-VS-1863 (Congressional Medal of Honor File) in the series\r\n   \u201cLetters Received by the Volunteer Service Division, 1861\u20131889\u201d (PI-17\r\n   Entry 496; National Archives Identifier 18573415\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/18573415>) -- 300 pages\r\n   - File in the series \u201cCase Files Relating to Corrections of Military\r\n   Records, 1961\u20132005\u201d (A1 Entry 814; National Archives Identifier 300358\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/300358>)\r\n      - Box 4 in this series contains the transcript of the 1977\r\n      proceedings of the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records\r\n      regarding Walker\u2019s Medal of Honor (National Archives Identifier\r\n      18463647 <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/18463647>) -- 85 pages\r\n\r\nA reproduction of all of the files referenced above are available for\r\npurchase. Our current fee for paper-to-paper (or paper-to-digital images)\r\nis $0.80 per page. The total number of pages for all three files is\r\napproximately 606 pages, which would bring the total cost for a\r\nreproduction to $484.80. To obtain copies of any or all of these records,\r\nplease email our office directly at archives1reference@nara.gov. In your\r\ncorrespondence, please reference the case number as \"RR1R-24-43958-JD.\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we also checked the Records of the Department of Veterans\r\nAffairs (Record Group 15) and located a pension file (#SC 142,715) for Mary\r\nEdwards Walker. A reproduction of this pension file is available for\r\npurchase and can be ordered online using form NATF 85. Please submit your\r\nrequest via the NARA website at the following address:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/pre-ww-1-records.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA's fee and fee waiver provisions do not apply to\r\narchival records. The fee statute, 44 U.S.C. 2116(c), does apply. It does\r\nnot authorize NARA to waive reproduction charges for individual requesters,\r\nand our inability to grant a fee waiver does not constitute a denial for\r\nthe purposes of the FOIA.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, please note that the records in Record Group 94 and Record\r\nGroup 15 that we noted above are open and available to the public and do\r\nnot require a FOIA request to access them. As such, you do not need to\r\nsubmit a FOIA request to obtain copies or view them in person. And with\r\nregards to the latter, you are welcome to visit our facility in Washington,\r\nDC, to view the records in our research room. While appointments are no\r\nlonger required, we do encourage interested researchers in making a\r\nresearch room room appointment. To do so, please click on the following\r\nlink: National Archives in Washington, DC (Research)\r\n<https://www.eventbrite.com/o/national-archives-in-washington-dc-research-48144467593>.\r\nOur DC building page can be found at: https://www.archives.gov/dc.\r\n\r\nThis completes the processing of your request. If you have any questions,\r\nyou may reach me via email at john.deeben@nara.gov.\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this response a denial under the Freedom of Information\r\nAct because we were able to locate records pertaining to your subject and\r\nhave provided you with instructions on how to obtain reproductions. Since\r\nthe records cited above are open and available to the public, you do not\r\nneed to file a Freedom of Information Act request to access them. However,\r\nif you are not satisfied with our action on this request, your options for\r\nappeal and dispute resolution are outlined in the attached enclosure.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJOHN P. DEEBEN\r\nArchivist, Archives 1 Reference Branch\r\nArchival Operations - Washington, DC\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n\r\n**********\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\r\nFrom: scanner <A1-405-HPLJ500MFPM525@nara.gov>\r\nDate: Fri, May 24, 2024 at 11:28\u202fAM\r\nSubject: Incoming FOIA - McCall\n",
