        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords sufficient to show the Kings County District Attorney's Office general retention schedule of records, the records inventory worksheet, and documentation describing policies and practices followed by the District Attorney's office on performing email searches and record redaction. These documents include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. The District Attorney's Office general retention period for records, including but not limited to emails, \r\n2. The District Attorney's Office current policies and guidelines related to records management, retention, and disposition\r\n3. The current, complete Master Records Schedule for the District Attorney's Office, or equivalent master index of records\r\n4. The most recent version of California State form STD. 70 (Records Inventory Worksheet) for the District Attorney's Office, or equivalent records\r\n5. The current Department Retention File plan for the District Attorney's Office, or equivalent records, such as the Departmental Records Retention Schedule or other relevant documents\r\n6. Records that describe how the DA's office performs email searches when searching for public records. These records may include, but are not limited to, technical manuals or vendor documentation describing the kinds of keyword searches can be performed, especially advanced or \"boolean\" searches\r\n7. Records which describe the technical limitations of the aforementioned system(s) for searching emails when it comes to searching and exporting results, such as the maximum number of records that can be exported for a single search and the maximum file size that can be exported for a single search\r\n8. Records describing the processes and tools used by the DA's office to redact sensitive information before returning records. This request does not cover policy documents explaining the legal bases for redacting; only the records that explain HOW redaction is carried out.\r\n\r\nFor numbered items 7, 8, and 9, please include, without limitation, technical manuals, vendor documentation, trainings, FAQs, and tutorials.\r\n\r\nFor reference, I have attached responses from the Los Angeles County District Attorney, San Francisco County District Attorney, and Alpine County District Attorney to California Public Records Act requests for similar documents. These include the following documents listed below:\r\n\r\n1. Los Angeles District Attorney Office Departmental Records Retention Schedule (DRRS), file name: \"los_angeles_county_dao_drrs.pdf\"\r\n2. San Francisco District Attorney's Office Record Retention and Destruction Policy, file name: \"san_francisco_dao_record_retention_policy.pdf\"\r\n3. Alpine County District Attorney's Office correspondence with MuckRock News on March 9, 2023 responding to Public Records Act request, file name: \"03_09_2023_alpine_county_dao_request_response.pdf\"\r\n\r\nPlease note that the California Public Records Act allows a member of the public to request records by describing their content, rather than asking for specific documents by name; an agency that receives such a request must \u201csearch for records based on criteria set forth in the search request.\u201d CFAC, 67 Cal. App. 4th at 165-66.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know should there be any clarification or assistance I can provide to in order to \"make a focused and effective request that reasonably describes an identifiable record or records\" (Gov. Code \u00a77922.600).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Doe",

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2025 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2025.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip or digital compression in each installment for the fewest number of total records and the most economical calculation of any applicable public records fees.\r\n\r\nUSE OF PORTAL NOT MANDATORY - DIRECTING REQUESTORS TO THIRD-PARTY LINKS VIOLATES ACCESS RIGHTS\r\n\r\nThird-party portals often require creating an account or logging in, restrict downloads or viewing times, and remove or disable links after a short period of time.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions unlawfully condition access to public records and are inconsistent with RCW 42.56.080 and RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, Washington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA.com) for  public records requests is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip or digital compression in each installment for the fewest number of total records and the most economical calculation of any applicable public records fees.\r\n\r\nUSE OF PORTAL NOT MANDATORY - DIRECTING REQUESTORS TO THIRD-PARTY LINKS VIOLATES ACCESS RIGHTS\r\n\r\nThird-party portals often require creating an account or logging in, restrict downloads or viewing times, and remove or disable links after a short period of time.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions unlawfully condition access to public records and are inconsistent with RCW 42.56.080 and RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, Washington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA.com) for  public records requests is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip or digital compression in each installment for the fewest number of total records and the most economical calculation of any applicable public records fees.\r\n\r\nUSE OF PORTAL NOT MANDATORY - DIRECTING REQUESTORS TO THIRD-PARTY LINKS VIOLATES ACCESS RIGHTS\r\n\r\nThird-party portals often require creating an account or logging in, restrict downloads or viewing times, and remove or disable links after a short period of time.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions unlawfully condition access to public records and are inconsistent with RCW 42.56.080 and RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, Washington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA.com) for  public records requests is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

The information is critical to inform the public about ongoing immigration enforcement actions currently taking place across the United States that may impact air travel at a time when both immigration and transportation are issues that are constantly in the news media every day. I believe this request qualifies for expedited processing under criteria outlines in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) and the implementing regulations of your agency.\r\n\r\nJustification for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\n1) Compelling Need for Urgency: There is a compelling need for the timely release of the requested records due to undocumented immigration and air travel being matters of significant public interest at this time. The information sought is critical to informing the public about how federal agencies deal with undocumented immigration and detained undocumented immigrants, as well as how these operations are taking place across airports in the United States.\r\n\r\n2) Public Interest: The requested records pertain to a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest and concern to the general public. Specifically, records relate to the arrest of undocumented migrants, an issue that has been the subject of extensive media coverage and public debate. Expedited processing is necessary to ensure that the public is informed about this issue in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n3) Risk of Irreparable Harm: Delay in processing this request could result in irreparable harm. For example, the requested records are needed to address the ongoing issue of undocumented immigration that has significant consequences for public safety, civil liberties, or government accountability, especially since it is related to how federal agencies are responding to this issue. Without expedited processing, the value of the requested information may be significantly diminished.\r\n\r\n4) Statutory and Regulatory Criteria: My request meets the statutory and regulatory criteria for expedited processing. My request is a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exists an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged federal government activity. My request has a compelling need for the information to address a pressing issue of public concern.\r\n\r\nI respectfully urge your agency to grant expedited processing for this FOIA request to ensure timely access to the requested records. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your commitment to upholding the principles of transparency and accountability under the FOIA. Thank you for your consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact me at carlosBP@protonmail.com if you require additional information or clarification regarding this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCarlos Berr\u00edos Polanco",

Since at least 2010, ICE has created and made public hundreds of videos of various internal agency operations, including arrests, detention, and removals. Recently ICE and accompanying agencies have released videos of operations in Los Angeles that have included a raid on MacArthur Park. Videographers accompanied the agency, and the content was shared across multiple platforms. Other operations have been videotaped and shared online by the agency. On one publicly available website, ICE videographers have uploaded videos of agency actions. Given ICE's widespread practice of recording its operations, additional and unedited recordings of ICE operations in California likely exist but have not been made public. These videos contain important information about the tactics used when arresting noncitizens and whether ICE officers are acting in a manner consistent with ICE's own protocols and state and federal due process laws. Because these video and audio records contain information about a critical government function on a matter of significant public interest and concern, FOIA mandates their disclosure.\r\n\r\nRequest:\r\n\r\n1. Visual recordings taken by the department or contracted videographers of ICE operations to share on social media, advertising, and with news outlets, including arrests, detention, and removals, in Los Angeles between January 6, 2025, to the present. \r\n\r\nThe Requestors:\r\n\r\nJoey Scott and Jeremy Lindenfield are both journalists who work in news gathering, including written and visual reporting. Joey Scott is a freelance investigative journalist in Los Angeles. Jeremy Lindenfield is a journalist for Capital and Main news.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver\r\n\r\nThe Requestor seeks a full fee waiver on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is in the public interest and is \"likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). As set forth above, this request aims to further public understanding of ICE programs and practices that directly affect untold numbers of noncitizens as well as members of the public captured in video recordings of ICE enforcement actions. These policies and practices are of interest to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe public interest fee waiver provision \"is to be liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters.\" McClellan Ecologic Seepage Situation v. Carlucci, 835 F.2d 1282, 1284 (9th Cir. 1987). The relevant question is whether the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, good or bad. See judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1314 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Disclosure of the information and report sought is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public's understanding of the treatment of immigrants during enforcement actions. The requested records also relate directly to government operations, including the use and storage of video files that potentially implicate fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to privacy. The requested records also relate to the relationship between the federal government and private, for-profit contracted entities.\r\n\r\nThe records are not sought for commercial use, and the Requestor plans to disseminate the information disclosed through print and other media to the public at no cost. As demonstrated above, the Requestor has both the intent and ability to convey any information obtained through this request to the public and is therefore entitled to a full fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).\r\n\r\nShould the request for a full fee waiver be denied, Requestor also seeks a limitation of processing fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) (\"fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by ... educational or noncommercial scientific institution ... or a representative of the news media\") and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(d)(1) (search fees shall not be charged to \"representatives of the news media\"). Requestor is a non-profit organization that intends to disseminate the information gathered by this request to the public at no cost, including through the Requestor's website and social media. The Requestor may publish a news story or other publication on the government's treatment of immigrants based on information gathered through this FOIA.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request has been reviewed in two parts:\r\n\r\nPart A \u2013 Calls for Service (Las Vegas Convention Center)\r\nTo obtain a list of calls for service\u2014including 911 Calls for Service, Communications Record Reports, or Phone and Radio Search & Reproduction\u2014you will need to contact our Communications Research Office.\r\n\r\nRequests may be submitted:\r\n\r\n  *   In person at LVMPD Headquarters or any LVMPD substation, or\r\n  *   Through the Communications Bureau Records Online Portal\r\n\r\n  *   Public Records | Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department<https://www.lvmpd.com/i-want-to/file/public-records>\r\n\r\nFor assistance, please contact the Communications Research Office directly at (702) 828-3871.\r\n\r\nOnce you have obtained event numbers from the Communications Research Office, you may submit a follow-up public records request with those specific event numbers, and we will be happy to assist in retrieving any related reports or materials that are eligible for release.\r\n\r\nPart B \u2013 Incident Involving Detention/Arrests at or Near the Venetian Hotel\r\nYour request appears to be non-specific and overbroad, as it does not identify a particular record or case. Under Nevada law and relevant legal guidance, a valid public records request must reasonably describe an identifiable public record.\r\n\r\nCourts have held that public agencies are required to disclose only \u201cidentifiable governmental records,\u201d not broad or vague requests for general information to be analyzed or compiled by the agency. See:\r\n\r\n  *   Hodai v. City of Tucson & Tucson Police Dep\u2019t, 2014 Ariz. Super. LEXIS 2158, *18 (2014)\r\n  *   MAG Entertainment, LLC v. Division of Alcohol Beverages Control, 868 A.2d 1067, 1076 (N.J. App. Div. 2005)\r\n  *   Capitol Information Association v. Ann Arbor Police, 360 N.W.2d 262, 263 (1985)\r\n  *   See also NAC 239.863(1)(c) (requiring sufficient description to identify a record)\r\n\r\nAt this time, the Public Records Unit is unable to identify a specific record based on the information provided.\r\nIf you are able to provide additional details\u2014such as a case number, event number,  exact date/time, or the full names of involved individuals\u2014we will gladly re-review the request.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us with any clarification or updates. We're happy to assist further when specific records can be identified.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Records Unit\r\nLas Vegas Metropolitan Police Department\r\n400-A South Martin L.

Your request was received in this office on 8/12/2025. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-54152.

For any relevant emails, please include all attachments to all messages.\r\n\r\nPlease do send records as they become available.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to modify this request if doing so would reduce the time it will take you to comply. Do let me know if this would be necessary.\r\n\r\nIf any aspect of this request is unreasonable pursuant to FOIL, exempt from the law, or unavailable, that should not slow provision of the rest of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf your agency finds a part of the request to be exempt from public release, the law requires that you do not withhold the document entirely but rather redact that part of the record.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny any portion of my request, please provide a written explanation for the denial, including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) authorizing the withholding of all or part of the record, as well as an explanation of why you believe disclosure is prevented by law (Article 6 Section 87.) Please also provide me with an email where I may send any appeals.\r\n\r\nPlease communicate with me by telephone or email rather than regular mail regarding my request. I would be happy to answer any questions that you have.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSanjana Bhambhani",
