I don't need every record, and I don't need the names.  I'm just looking for documents that would show me how many people.  For example, if a list exists, I would accept a list in which each name is redacted, which would allow me to ascertain the total number.  Or if notifications were made by letter or email, you could provide me those communications, again with names redacted.  I'm open to other approaches.  Because I am only looking for documents sufficient to show, and because there may not even be any other such people, I request that you do not start by conducting an electronic search, but instead simply contact Ms. Bondi or the appropriate person on her staff to ask whether there have been any such notifications.  If they tell you there have not, I would not ask you to conduct any further searches.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Topic",
