My name is Joseph Anderson\u00a0and I am a Deputy Public Records Officer\u00a0for Skamania County. I assist inreviewing and responding to public records requests (PRRs) for alldepartments. \r\n\r\nOn July 13, 2025, we received your public records request for \"- Any and all lists, spreadsheets or other organized datasets that detail potential or substantiated allegations of misconduct and/or impeached or impeachable testimony, created under Brady v. Maryland and/or Giglio v. United States. \r\n- Any and all records regarding substantiated allegations of misconduct or violations of internal department policy or criminal law by specific law enforcement officers. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\" \r\nAfter reviewing our files, we have located records that are responsive to your request. Please log in to the Skamania County Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve the records responsive to your request: County Public Records Request - C003439-071325 Pleasenote the following information from Skamania County Prosecutor AdamKick with respect to the first part of your request, as writtenabove, regarding Brady\u00a0or Giglio\u00a0material: \"[Skamania County does not] have a 'Brady\u00a0list,' per se.There is one deputy that works for the Skamania county Sheriff\u2019s Officefor whom we have potential impeachment information and for whom weprovide a memo summarizing the circumstances. We provide this memo whenrequired to defense counsel on cases involving this deputy. Becausethere is only one local deputy for whom we maintain PID information,there is no list. Just the single memo, which we are happy to provide. [ Potential Impeachment Disclosure memo attached here .] TheWashington State Patrol sometimes sends us information from state-widepotential impeachment issues with WSP employees. We do not maintain thisinformation in any organized way because it does not apply to anyofficers that regularly appear in our courts/cases. I just want toconfirm that these records are not made into any list, and to the extentthat these records are related to WSP employees, are likely bettersought from the WSP directly, if you\u2019re interested in the raw data (inaddition to any lists).\" I have been advised by the Sheriff's Office that there are no records responsive to the second portion of your request seeking\u00a0records regarding substantiated allegations of misconduct or violations of internaldepartment policy or criminal law by specific law enforcement officers. SkamaniaCounty has searched for, attempted to identify, locate, and provide anynon-exempt public records that may be responsive to this request. Since this completely fulfills your request, we are now closing this public records request. The one (1) yearstatute of limitations to seek judicial review under the Public RecordsAct (Chapter 42.56 RCW) begins now because Skamania County does notintend to further address this request. Please note that if you do not review and download your records within thirty (30) days, they may be removed from the system, in which case you will have to start the public records process all over again to receive your requested records. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns by replying to this email or at my phone number below. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoseph Anderson \r\nDeputy Public Records Officer \r\nOffice of the Skamania County Prosecuting Attorney \r\n240 NW Vancouver Avenue | PO Box 790 \r\nStevenson, WA 98648 \r\n509-427-3791",

I am seeking copies of calendar entries for events that were held or proposed. I am not seeking a search of records held by students or student organizations. I am only seeking information held by the university administration (for example, in an Event Management System, which may be helpful in providing a list of past events and proposed future events). \r\n\r\nIf this request is unclear or if I could clarify it in any way, please don't hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\nI request:\r\n\r\n1. All calendar entries (or Event Management System database entries) for events held or sponsored by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member during the final two weeks of each term during 2023, 2024, and Winter/Spring 2025. If your institution's academic calendar does not identify a final date of a given term, please use the final day of exams for the term as the final day of the term.\r\n\r\n2. All calendar entries (or Event Management System database entries) for events held or sponsored by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member after 10:00 p.m. and/or before 8:00 a.m., between January 31, 2023 and July 1, 2025.\r\n\r\n3. All calendar entries for events which are or were proposed to be held by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member, where the event is proposed to be held after 10:00 p.m. and/or before 8:00 a.m. This request is limited to events that are proposed to be held between July 1, 2025 and July 1, 2026. \r\n\r\n4. All calendar entries for events which are or were proposed to be held by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member, where the event is proposed to be during the final two weeks of a term in the Fall 2025, Winter 2025-2026, or Spring 2026 semesters/terms. Please us the same means of calculating \"final two weeks\" as in (1), above.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

office on 6/30/2025,\u00a0wherein you requested, \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nThis is a survey of events planned or proposed by recognized or registered student organizations (or individual students or faculty members). I am seeking copies of calendar entries for events that were held or proposed. I am not seeking a search of records held by students or student organizations. I am only seeking information held by the university administration (for example, in an Event Management System, which may be helpful in providing a list of past events and proposed future events). \r\n\r\nIf this request is unclear or if I could clarify it in any way, please don't hesitate to ask. \r\n\r\nI request: \r\n\r\n1. All calendar entries (or Event Management System database entries) for events held or sponsored by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member during the final two weeks of each term during 2023, 2024, and Winter/Spring 2025. If your institution's academic calendar does not identify a final date of a given term, please use the final day of exams for the term as the final day of the term. \r\n\r\n2. All calendar entries (or Event Management System database entries) for events held or sponsored by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member after 10:00 p.m. and/or before 8:00 a.m., between January 31, 2023 and July 1, 2025. \r\n\r\n3. All calendar entries for events which are or were proposed to be held by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member, where the event is proposed to be held after 10:00 p.m. and/or before 8:00 a.m. This request is limited to events that are proposed to be held between July 1, 2025 and July 1, 2026. \r\n\r\n4. All calendar entries for events which are or were proposed to be held by a registered student organization, individual student, or faculty member, where the event is proposed to be during the final two weeks of a term in the Fall 2025, Winter 2025-2026, or Spring 2026 semesters/terms. Please us the same means of calculating \"final two weeks\" as in (1), above. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh \r\nWe have reviewed our files and located the attached documents that are responsive to your request.\u00a0 Although the TPIA allows a governmental body to charge for copying documents, the attached is provided to you at no charge. \r\nIf you have any questions or wish to discuss this further, you may contact me at 210-458-7500 / 210-458-4105 or via email at publicinfo@utsa.edu. \r\n\r\nSincerely, Kathleen Blanton Open Records Manager \r\nThe University of Texas at San Antonio \r\nOffice of Legal Affairs - Open Records \r\nwww.utsa.edu/openrecords **If you wish to make or amend an open records request to UTSA you may do so online at www.utsa.edu/openrecords.**",

Records Requested: To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1) A user data export from the university's ChatGPT EDU user analytics dashboard covering the time period January 1, 2025 until the date this request is processed. A description of this data and how to export it from the dashboard are available here: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10875114-user-analytics-for-chatgpt-enterprise-and-edu.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting the data export report described in that help article under the heading \"User export - column definitions\". Several of the data columns in the export (\"name\" and \"email\") contain personally identifiable information and I acknowledge that these columns must be redacted or removed from the responsive record.\r\n\r\n2) A GPT data export from the university's ChatGPT EDU user analytics dashboard covering the time period January 1, 2025 until the date this request is processed. Specifically, I am requesting the data export report described in the help article linked above under the heading \"GPT export - column definitions.\" I acknowledge that this report contains one data column (\"gpt_creator_email\") that must be redacted or removed from the responsive record.\r\n\r\nI ask that the responsive records be provided as .csv files or in a comparable, data-friendly file type.\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as the records I have requested are readily available and can be instantly exported from the user analytics dashboard. The necessary redactions can also be done quickly and in mass by removing the relevant columns from the dataset.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please be advised that parent/guardian information was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). \r\nSection 7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).

However, TTUS seeks to discuss with you how the scope of your request might be narrowed and/or clarified pursuant to Texas Government Code \u00a7 552.222(b).  TTUS requests that you narrow or clarify the scope of your request as follows:\r\n\r\n  1.\r\nYour request seems to be for ALL the academic dishonesty reports from the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester to the end of the Spring 2025 Semester.  Currently, the information requested is unclear and may contain protected information, as many reports may contain personally identifiable information about students, which is confidential by federal and state law. Further, the gathering and required redactions of all of these documents may result in significant costs to you.  Narrowing your request to specific reports (i.e. statistics or final disposition letters) may allow us to clearly identify the information you seek more effectively and, potentially, at a lower cost.\r\n  2.\r\nIn addition, Texas Tech University has over 40,000 students, so a request for all disposition letters over a five-year time period, will be significantly expensive. Please consider narrowing the time frame of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease simply respond to this request and let us know if you are willing to narrow/clarify the scope of your request in the manner suggested or in some other manner.  Please note that we may be required to send information to the Texas Attorney General for review prior to release.  That process could take 2-3 months.  TTUS is required to inform you that if you do not respond to this request for narrowing/clarification within 61 days from the date of this request, your request will be considered withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBront\u00eb C.

Employee phone numbers were redacted from responsive records pursuant to Government Code section 7922.000. Please contact the employing agency to reach a specific employee. \r\nThe names of employees who work in undercover, plain clothes positions that demand anonymity were removed pursuant to Government Code section 7922.000. Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training v. Superior Court, 42 Cal.4th 278, 301 (2007). The anonymity of these deputies is essential to their safety and effectiveness, and warrants exempting their identity and information about their position from disclosure. The public interest served by not disclosing the information clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the information. \r\nLastly, the search for responsive emails did not include communications to or from the Legal Affairs Unit as attorney-client privilege and attorney-work product emails are exempt pursuant to GC 7927.705 incorporating attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine.

        "communication": "Dear Wendy Sawyer: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P060600-072025.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G.
