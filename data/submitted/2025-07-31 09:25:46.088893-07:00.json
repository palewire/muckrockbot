Decision-Making Processes:\r\n   - Meeting minutes, memos, emails, and other communications discussing the selection of Microsoft Business Intelligence (BI) as the platform for the MiSUD treatment locator tool.\r\n   - Documentation outlining the evaluation criteria and process for selecting the technology stack, including any comparative analyses of alternative tools or platforms to host MiSUD.\r\n   - Needs assessment documentation outlining the evaluation criteria of existing treatment locators, including any comparative analyses and gaps that MiSUD is intended to fill.\r\n\r\n3. Project Documentation:\r\n   - Project plans, timelines, and scope documents related to the development of the MiSUD treatment locator tool.\r\n   - Requirements documents, use cases, and user stories that informed the MiSUD development process.\r\n\r\n4.

If there are any fees associated with this request, please inform me of the total cost before processing the request. I am willing to pay reasonable fees up to $25.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you require any additional information to process this request.

EO 13526 \u00a7\u00a01.6(a)(1)(D) information (in the case of information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the marking prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to EO 13526)\r\nl. EO 13526 \u00a7\u00a03.3(b), (c), (d), (g), (h), (i), & (j) information (automatic declassification exemption), including the particular subparagraphs claimed to be applicable, and the applicable details (such as explanations of exemption, date exempted, exempting authority, etc)\r\nm. all other classification metadata, such as \"derived from\" markers (see e.g. EO 13526 \u00a7\u00a02.1), foreign classifications (see e.g. EO 13526 \u00a7\u00a01.6(e)), etc.\r\nn. the FOIA identifiers of every request made which covered that record\r\no. the same information as above as to declassification, to the extent applicable (e.g. dates, declassification authority and reasons, control authority, etc)\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction format \r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content, please assign a replacement identifier for each different piece of content redacted, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nPlease use a unique replacement identifier number for each distinct item \u2014 e.g. even if you only redact two entities, and they have different descriptors such that the descriptors would distinguish them, use \"confidential source 1\" and \"US congressional aide 2\", not \"US congressional aide 1\". The result should be that there is exactly one replacement identifier number per identical redacted content, across all records produced, with no reuse of the same number for different content, nor use of different numbers for the same content \u2014 except for the purposes of descriptive reference, e.g. the \"2\" in \"confidential source 1 email to US congressional aide 2\".\r\n\r\nIf a classification codeword is itself classified \u2014 meaning very specifically the text of that codeword, e.g. if the literal texts \"STLW\" and/or \"STELLARWIND\" were themselves classified, not merely their expansions, referents, or covered records \u2014  please use a replacement like \"TSC 4\" or \"SC 5\" (as applicable). Likewise, if the existence of a particular classification authority office is classified, please use a replacement like \"NSA office 6\". Etc.\r\n\r\nFor PDFs, replacement identifiers can be specified in the margins if they don't fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use just the replacement identifier number (e.g. \"[#52]\"), and provide a CSV formatted table matching replacement identifier numbers to full replacement identifiers with your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, and specifies the form and format of your redactions, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request. If you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using a replacement identifier that encodes only the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* the DNI has determined that widespread public release of these records is in the public interest; and\r\n* the release of these records is itself a matter of international journalistic interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of all communications and records ICE provided DHS for its June 26, 2025, \"Fact Check\", available here: https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/06/26/fact-check-ice-provided-full-medical-care-guatemalan-illegal-alien-history-child.\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e) and hereby declare under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746that the following statements in support of my expedited processing request are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding:\r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the news media primarily engaged in information dissemination through edited publications. See, e.g., https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; https://atlpresscollective.com/author/free/.\r\n2. Ms. Monterrosso-Lemus's miscarriage in ICE custody has been the subject of widespread and exceptional media coverage raising concerns regarding the government's supervision of its contractors, which prompted DHS Press Secretary McLaughlin to issue a purported official debunking of the press coverage. https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/05/27/iris-monterroso-pregnancy-loss/; https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/woman-ice-custody-loses-baby-after-begging-help-she-was-forced-sleep-floor-eating-1736693; https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-dhs-contests-claim-ice-denied-pregnant-woman-care-absolutely-false.\r\n3. Members of Congress have demanded an investigation into Ms. Monterrosso-Lemus's allegations of abuse and neglect in ICE custody: https://democraticwomenscaucus.house.gov/media/press-releases/democratic-womens-caucus-demands-investigation-ice-and-cbps-abuse-women.\r\n4. The records requested are necessary to assess the veracity of DHS's claims in its Fact Check, several of which appear to be incorrect. For instance, the subject's husband has medical records from treatment providers as Ochsner Medical in Louisiana indicating the loss of the baby was due to inadequate PNC (pre-natal care). Similarly, the \"active warrant for homicide\" DHS states she had in Guatemala had been terminated years ago, which is why, after spending a week in jail upon her return, the subject was let go and is not being prosecuted.\r\n5. Ms. McLaughlin has claimed, on the U.S. government's behalf, \"\u201cThis reporting is absolutely FALSE. Iris Dayana Monterroso-Lemus had FULL medical, prenatal care,\u201d and \u201cWe have documentation to show it.\r\n6. The public deserves timely access to that documentation, if it exists.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",
