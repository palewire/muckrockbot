If redactions are necessary, I ask that the remainder of the footage still be released. Please notify me of any associated costs prior to processing.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
