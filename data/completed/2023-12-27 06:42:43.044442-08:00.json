Project Fantasia was a collaboration between the Office of Strategic Services (record group 226) and the Office of Scientific Research and Development (record group 227), and was assigned a project number of SAC-26. A 2016 article published by NARA in Prologue Magazine, titled \"Secret Weapons, Forgotten Sacrifices,\" contains a description of Project Fantasia and identifies some of the records as being in record group 227. It can be found here: https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2016/spring/office-scientific-research-development-world-war-ii\r\n\r\nPlease restrict your search for any records to record groups 226 and 227.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to review these records in-person, at your location in College Park, Maryland. If any of these records are being held at a facility other than the one in College Park, please notify me of this before processing the request.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please advise which tier of processing queue this request falls under and an estimated time frame for processing.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said destruction or transfer, to include but not be limited to confirmation that NARA has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

We have assigned your request tracking number SBA-2019-000560, please use this tracking number when referring to your request in the future.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the FOIA provides a right of access to federal agency records that exist and can be located in agency files. The FOIA does not require agencies to answer questions in response to FOIA requests. However, we will make an exception and process your request.\r\n\r\nItem 1: we can provide the number of site visits since 2011 (see attached).\r\nItem 2: no records.\r\nItem 3: this portion of the request has been referred to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer for response.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with this action, you may appeal this decision to the Chief, Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts Office, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 Third St., SW, Washington, DC 20416. You must submit an appeal within 90 calendar days of the date of the notice of denial. Your appeal should contain a copy of this correspondence, a description of the information requested in addition to what was denied, the name and title of the SBA official or employee who denied the request, the reason for the denial, and any other facts you deem appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation. You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:\r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\nE-mail: ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>\r\nTelephone: 202-741-5770\r\nToll-free: 1-877-684-6448\r\n\r\nPlease note that using OGIS services does not affect the timing of filing an appeal with the SBA's FOI/PA Officer.\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest in the Small Business Administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nv/r\r\n\r\nDavida Bobo\r\nAdministrative Officer, Operations\r\nGovernment Contracting and Business Development\r\nU.S. Small Business Administration\r\n\r\ndavida.bobo@sba.gov<mailto:davida.bobo@sba.gov>\r\n\r\n[SBA-Hor-2]\r\n\r\nHome Page<http://www.sba.gov/> | Twitter<http://www.twitter.com/sbagov> | Instagram <http://www.instagram.com/sbagov> | Facebook<http://www.facebook.com/sbagov> | YouTube<http://www.youtube.com/sba> | LinkedIn<http://www.linkedin.com/company/us-small-business-administration> | Email Alerts<http://www.sba.gov/updates>",

Any policy, guidance, handbook, or manual concerning the interactions or communications of institutional employees, including faculty, administrators, staff, and student employees, with the news media, reporters, or journalists, including but not limited to student journalists. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Daniel Ellsberg. Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

I see that in the reply that contains these previously released documents, additional records that are responsive to my request exist. I am writing to confirm within the allotted thirty day window that this material does not satisfy my request as most of the documents are more than forty years old, and many are much older. I understand that Dr. Daniel Ellsberg continued to be of interest to the FBI long after the early 1980s. I request that the additional records about my requested subject be processed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in this matter.",

I apologize for not explaining this more clearly and also not explaining that those SAAs for each movie is a complete list of movies for the time period specified in the request.\r\n\r\nI also mentioned NASA\u2019s Records Retention Schedule, which is available at following web address: https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/NPR_attachments/NRRS_1441.1.pdf. If permanent records exist they may have been sent to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in accordance with the Federal Records Act and NASA Records Record Retention Schedule. NARA\u2019s contact is available at the following website: https://www.archives.gov/foia/contacts.html.\r\n\r\nWe also talked about NASA points of contact who have their email and phone numbers listed online for media outlets and media researchers. You can find those contacts at the following website (some have email addresses and phone numbers listed) : https://www.nasa.gov/news/media-contacts/.\r\n\r\nHopefully this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions about this FOIA request which I can assist.\r\n\nThank you,\r\nDerek Moore",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny and all records mentioning, relating to, or generated as a result of investigation or inquiry into William David Foreman, also known as David Foreman or Dave Foreman. Mr. Foreman was a prominent environmental activist for over four decades and was co-founder of the organizations Earth First! and the Rewilding Institute as well as the founding publisher of the Earth First Journal.\r\n\r\nMr. Foreman was born on Oct. 18, 1946, in Albuquerque and died on Sept. 19, 2022, in Albuquerque. Specific proof of death is not required as Mr. Foreman\u2019s death has been widely publicized. This is a link to his obituary published in The New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/us/david-foreman-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release. For this request, the term \u201call records\u201d refers to, but is not limited to, any and all documents, correspondence (including, but not limited to, inter and/or intra-agency correspondence as well as correspondence with entities or individuals outside the federal government such as the subject and/or his affiliates, agents, contractors, representatives or lawyers), emails, letters, notes, audio or video recordings, telephone records, voicemails, telephone notes, telephone logs, text messages, chat messages, minutes, memoranda, comments, files, presentations, consultations, assessments, evaluations, schedules, papers published and/or unpublished, reports, studies, photographs and other images, and/or all other responsive records, in draft or final form.  This includes all attachments and/or linked documents noted in the responsive records.\r\n\r\nI also request that fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(a)(4)(A)(iii). The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press, and is made in the process of news gathering. The responsive records will also be provided to nonprofit public interest environmental organizations. As the requester, I am a qualified researcher with a nonprofit environmental organization, and will release and share the records in order to inform the public about Mr. Foreman\u2019s work and activities and to contribute to the public\u2019s understanding of the operations and actions of a government agency. This request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that a fee waiver is not granted and there are fees as a result, I would appreciate if you would inform me of the estimated charges to receive the records in advance, if the estimated cost is expected to be more than $25.00.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that any of the responsive records will be exempt from disclosure, as FOIA exemptions must be identified, applied narrowly, and justified by the agency in light of the particular exemption as applied. However, if you determine that responsive records are exempt from disclosure, please separate the exempt portions from the nonexempt portions and release the nonexempt portions. For any records that you determine to be exempt from release, please provide a specific description of the agency record or portion of the record along with a particularized description of the legal basis for withholding it and the FOIA-recognized harm that the agency believes would warrant the withholding. \r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the responsive records electronically, if possible, by electronic download from a website, by attachment to email, or by CD or thumbnail digital storage. If the responsive records are not available electronically, then I request that you mail copies to me using the contact information below.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJennifer Thurston",

The responsive records will also be provided to nonprofit public\r\n    interest environmental organizations. As the requester, I am a qualified\r\n    researcher with a nonprofit environmental organization, and will release and\r\n    share the records in order to inform the public about Mr. Foreman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work and\r\n    activities and to contribute to the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understanding of the operations\r\n    and actions of a government agency. This request is not being made for\r\n    commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that a fee waiver is not granted and there are fees as a\r\n    result, I would appreciate if you would inform me of the estimated charges\r\n    to receive the records in advance, if the estimated cost is expected to be\r\n    more than $25.00.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Please See attachment for description.\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation **\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress.

With respect to when the 10 days begins to run, California Code of Civil Procedure section 12 provides that the \u201ctime in which any act provided by law is to be done is computed by excluding the first day and including the last, unless the last day is a holiday, and then it is also excluded.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus, the 10 day period for response to a PRA request would begin the day after receipt of the PRA request.  For example, if an agency received a PRA request on Monday, September 25, the 10 day period would begin on Tuesday, September 26 and expire on Thursday, October 5.\r\n\r\nDo you need more time?\r\n\r\nMolly",

        "communication": "Dear Department Of Correction Records Access Officer:\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n1. All existing monthly, quarterly, and annual reports or other records that indicate the number of people within DOC custody (including DOC pre-release and/or home confinement) who are subject to electronic monitoring (by which we mean GPS or ankle bracelet monitoring, hereinafter referred to as \u201cELMO\u201d) from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. We are interested in records that indicate the average length of time an individual is on ELMO, the reason that an individual is on ELMO and the geographic and demographic (race, ethnicity, age, sex) breakdowns of individuals on ELMO.\r\n2. Records that include information on the operation and implementation of ELMO, including:\r\n  a. Policy manuals or other guidance documents that address, mention, discuss, or implement (by name or in substance)  of 103 DOC 468 \r\n       Electronic Monitoring Program,\r\n  b. Guidance on how violations of ELMO terms/conditions are handled,\r\n  c. Any documents or records that show the impact of ELMO term/condition violations (i.e. whether the individual re-incarcerated, etc),\r\n  d.  Any documents or records that address which staff or unit(s) are responsible for monitoring participants in the DOC ELMO program,\r\n  e.  Any documents, presentations, emails, or other records prepared by the Office of Investigative Services in relation to training staff slated \r\n  to work as a unit responsible for electronic monitoring,\r\n  f.  The cost of ELMO GPS devices to individuals who are on ELMO, if any, and\r\n  g.  Any memorandum of understanding or other records that define the relationship between DOC and Massachusetts Probation Service or \r\n   its ELMO vendors for the provision of people subject to ELMO in DOC custody, pre-release, or home confinement\r\n3. An extract of your records management system that indicates line-level data of the number of individuals on ELMO who are under the DOC\u2019s custody on pre-release, on home confinement, or otherwise from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. Specifically, we request the following fields in an excel or CSV format for all people who were on ELMO at any point at your agency during the above-mentioned time:\r\n  a. The individual\u2019s start date on ELMO\r\n  b. The individual\u2019s end date on ELMO \r\n  c. Reason/status of individual on ELMO (i.e. parole, pre-release, home confinement, etc.)\r\n  d.Reason for individual being released from ELMO, if applicable\r\n  e. County and Zip Code of individual\r\n  f. Age of individual\r\n  g. Gender of individual \r\n  h. Race of individual\r\n  i. Ethnicity of individual \r\n  j. Underlying lead charge and/or offense for which the person was convicted\r\n  k. Whether the person\u2019s GPS conditions were allegedly violated, how many times such an alleged violation occurred, whether the violation was sustained, and what the outcome of said violation was, if applicable. \r\n\r\nThis information does not require identified data or any personally identifying information of any person in the custody of the Department of Correction. This records request seeks only aggregate statistics, or non-identifying database extracts, and documents as outlined above.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the form of production, we note that relevant regulations require the production of records in an accessible, commonly used electronic form, to the extent feasible. See 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). Record custodians are also required to implement new record keeping systems and databases in such a way as to allow for \u201cretrieval of public portions of records to provide maximum public access.\u201d See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(e). Extraction of such data from a database or electronic record system does not constitute creating a new record. See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(f). Printing these records from a database or electronic system, redacting them with a marker, and then re-scanning them, is generally not consistent with these regulations; this process provides the digital records neither in the preferred form nor in a \u201csearchable machine-readable form.\u201d 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). If necessary, we welcome reasonable suggested modifications pursuant to 950 CMR 32.06(2)(g). Per Attorney Gen. v. Dist. Attorney for Plymouth Dist., 484 Mass. 260, 141 N.E.3d 429 (2020), compiling information from a database is not tantamount to creating a new record that would otherwise be precluded under public records law. Specifically: \u201cWhere public records are in electronic form, a public records request that requires a government entity to search its electronic database to extract requested data does not mean that the extracted data constitute the creation of a new record, which would not be required, under the public records law. \" Id. at 442 to 443. Thus, we request that your department query its database and provide a response to the records request.\r\n\r\nShould you determine that some portions of the documents are exempt from disclosure, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are not exempt. In addition, please note for any such redactions the applicable statutory exemption and explain why it applies to the redacted or withheld information.\r\n\r\nI also request that fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by email attachment if available.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nErin Stewart\r\nSchool to Prison Pipeline Project\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

Any documents or records that show the impact of ELMO term/condition violations (i.e. whether the individual re-incarcerated, etc),\nd. Any documents or records that address which staff or unit(s) are responsible for monitoring participants in the DOC ELMO program,\ne. Any documents, presentations, emails, or other records prepared by the Office of Investigative Services in relation to training staff slated\nto work as a unit responsible for electronic monitoring,\nf. The cost of ELMO GPS devices to individuals who are on ELMO, if any, and\ng. Any memorandum of understanding or other records that define the relationship between DOC and Massachusetts Probation Service or\nits ELMO vendors for the provision of people subject to ELMO in DOC custody, pre-release, or home confinement\n3. An extract of your records management system that indicates line-level data of the number of individuals on ELMO who are under the DOC\u2019s custody on pre-release, on home confinement, or otherwise from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. Specifically, we request the following fields in an excel or CSV format for all people who were on ELMO at any point at your agency during the above-mentioned time:\na. The individual\u2019s start date on ELMO\nb. The individual\u2019s end date on ELMO\nc. Reason/status of individual on ELMO (i.e. parole, pre-release, home confinement, etc.)\nd.Reason for individual being released from ELMO, if applicable\ne. County and Zip Code of individual\nf. Age of individual\ng. Gender of individual\nh. Race of individual\ni. Ethnicity of individual\nj. Underlying lead charge and/or offense for which the person was convicted\nk. Whether the person\u2019s GPS conditions were allegedly violated, how many times such an alleged violation occurred, whether the violation was sustained, and what the outcome of said violation was, if applicable.\n\nThis information does not require identified data or any personally identifying information of any person in the custody of the Department of Correction. This records request seeks only aggregate statistics, or non-identifying database extracts, and documents as outlined above.\n\nWith respect to the form of production, we note that relevant regulations require the production of records in an accessible, commonly used electronic form, to the extent feasible. See 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). Record custodians are also required to implement new record keeping systems and databases in such a way as to allow for \u201cretrieval of public portions of records to provide maximum public access.\u201d See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(e). Extraction of such data from a database or electronic record system does not constitute creating a new record. See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(f). Printing these records from a database or electronic system, redacting them with a marker, and then re-scanning them, is generally not consistent with these regulations; this process provides the digital records neither in the preferred form nor in a \u201csearchable machine-readable form.\u201d 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). If necessary, we welcome reasonable suggested modifications pursuant to 950 CMR 32.06(2)(g). Per Attorney Gen. v. Dist. Attorney for Plymouth Dist., 484 Mass. 260, 141 N.E.3d 429 (2020), compiling information from a database is not tantamount to creating a new record that would otherwise be precluded under public records law. Specifically: \u201cWhere public records are in electronic form, a public records request that requires a government entity to search its electronic database to extract requested data does not mean that the extracted data constitute the creation of a new record, which would not be required, under the public records law. \" Id. at 442 to 443. Thus, we request that your department query its database and provide a response to the records request.\n\nShould you determine that some portions of the documents are exempt from disclosure, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are not exempt. In addition, please note for any such redactions the applicable statutory exemption and explain why it applies to the redacted or withheld information.\n\nI also request that fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by email attachment if available.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoshua Dankoff\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\nErin Stewart\nSchool to Prison Pipeline Project\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice \nYour request will be forwarded to the relevant department(s) to locate the information you seek and to determine the volume and any costs associated with satisfying your request. You will be contacted about the availability and/or provided with copies of the records in question. \n \nYou can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you'll receive an email when your request has been completed.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Manuel de Dios Unanue (4 January 1943 \u2013 11\r\n    March 1992) who was a Cuban-born US journalist, radio show host, anti-drug\r\n    crusading editor of magazines Cambio XXI and Crimen, and editor-in-chief of\r\n    El Diario La Prensa, New York City's largest Spanish-language daily\r\n    newspaper.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

We appreciate your interest in these records and understand that knowing when you might be able receive a response to your request is helpful.\r\n\r\nThe program office tasked for records has provided us with potentially responsive records your request has been added to our processing queue. It is very difficult to provide an accurate estimated date of completion until our FOIA analyst reviews these records for responsiveness and we have a better sense of the number of pages and the sensitivity of the material. Our general expectation is that we will be able to send you a final response within 3-4 months.\r\n\r\nPlease know that this estimate may change dramatically based on the volume of work associated with our expedited COVID-19 requests that are in front of the queue and on the types of records we received from the Program office regarding your request.\r\nRegardless of the specificity of your request, we cannot accurately estimate the amount of time it will take to process the record until we understand both the volume and sensitivity of the records.\r\nWe hope that this response provides additional insight into why we are not able to give you a more precise estimated date of completion, and why we expect it will take 3-4 months for us to respond to your request. Please let us know if you have any other questions about our processes.\"",
