DISPOSITION OF ABANDONED OR UNCLAIMED PROPERTY.\r\n\r\n(a)  All unclaimed or abandoned personal property of every kind, other than contraband subject to forfeiture under Chapter 59 and whiskey, wine and malt beverages, seized by any peace officer in the State of Texas which is not held as evidence to be used in any pending case and has not been ordered destroyed or returned to the person entitled to possession of the same by a magistrate, which shall remain unclaimed for a period of 30 days shall be delivered for disposition to a person designated by the municipality or the purchasing agent of the county in which the property was seized.  If a peace officer of a municipality seizes the property, the peace officer shall deliver the property to a person designated by the municipality.  If any other peace officer seizes the property, the peace officer shall deliver the property to the purchasing agent of the county.  If the county has no purchasing agent, then such property shall be disposed of by the sheriff of the county.\r\n\r\n(b)  The county purchasing agent, the person designated by the municipality, or the sheriff of the county, as the case may be, shall mail a notice to the last known address of the owner of such property by certified mail.  Such notice shall describe the property being held, give the name and address of the officer holding such property, and shall state that if the owner does not claim such property within 90 days from the date of the notice such property will be disposed of and the proceeds, after deducting the reasonable expense of keeping such property and the costs of the disposition, placed in the treasury of the municipality or county giving the notice.\r\n\r\n(c)  If the property has a fair market value of $500 or more and the owner or the address of the owner is unknown, the person designated by the municipality, the county purchasing agent, or the sheriff, as the case may be, shall cause to be published once in a paper of general circulation in the municipality or county a notice containing a general description of the property held, the name of the owner if known, the name and address of the officer holding such property, and a statement that if the owner does not claim such property within 90 days from the date of the publication such property will be disposed of and the proceeds, after deducting the reasonable expense of keeping such property and the costs of the disposition, placed in the treasury of the municipality or county disposing of the property.  If the property has a fair market value of less than $500 and the owner or the address of the owner is unknown, the person designated by the municipality, the county purchasing agent, or the sheriff may sell or donate the property.  The person designated by the municipality, the purchasing agent, or the sheriff shall deposit the sale proceeds, after deducting the reasonable expense of keeping the property and costs of the sale, in the treasury of the municipality or county selling or donating the property.\r\n\r\n(d)  The sale under this article of any property that has a fair market value of $500 or more shall be preceded by a notice published once at least 14 days prior to the date of such sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or county where the sale is to take place, stating the general description of the property, the names of the owner if known, and the date and place that such sale will occur.  This article does not require disposition by sale.\r\n\r\n(d-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d), if property described by Subsection (a), other than money, is seized by a peace officer at the time the owner of the property is arrested for an offense punishable as a Class C misdemeanor, the law enforcement agency may provide notice to the owner at the time the owner is taken into or released from custody.  On receiving the notice, the owner must sign the notice and attach a thumbprint to the notice.  The notice must include:\r\n\r\n(1)  a description of the property being held;\r\n\r\n(2)  the address where the property is being held; and\r\n\r\n(3)  a statement that if the owner does not claim the property before the 31st day after the date the owner is released from custody, the property will be disposed of and the proceeds of the property, after deducting the reasonable expense of keeping and disposing of the property, will be placed in the treasury of the municipality or county providing the notice.\r\n\r\n(d-2)  If the property for which notice is provided under Subsection (d-1) is not claimed by the owner before the 31st day after the date the owner is released from custody, the law enforcement agency holding the property shall deliver the property for disposition to a person designated by the municipality or to the purchasing agent or sheriff of the county in which the property was seized, as applicable.  The person designated by the municipality, the purchasing agent, or the sheriff may sell or donate the property without mailing or publishing an additional notice as required by Subsection (b), (c), or (d).  The sale proceeds, after deducting the reasonable expense of keeping and disposing of the property, must be deposited in the treasury of the municipality or county disposing of the property.\r\n\r\n(e)  The real owner of any property disposed of shall have the right to file a claim to the proceeds with the commissioners court of the county or with the governing body of the municipality in which the disposition took place.  A claim by the real owner must be filed not later than the 30th day after the date of disposition.  If the claim is allowed by the commissioners court or the governing body of the municipality, the municipal or county treasurer shall pay the owner such funds as were paid into the treasury of the municipality or county as proceeds of the disposition. If the claim is denied by the commissioners court or the governing body or if said court or body fails to act upon such claim within 90 days, the claimant may sue the municipal or county treasurer in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county, and upon sufficient proof of ownership, recover judgment against such municipality or county for the recovery of the proceeds of the disposition.\r\n\r\n(f)  For the purposes of this article:\r\n\r\n(1)  \"Person designated by a municipality\" means an officer or employee of a municipality who is designated by the municipality to be primarily responsible for the disposition of property under this article.\r\n\r\n(2)  \"Property held as evidence\" means property related to a charge that has been filed or to a matter that is being investigated for the filing of a charge.\r\n\r\n(g)  If the provisions of this section have been met and the property is scheduled for disposition, the municipal or county law enforcement agency that originally seized the property may request and have the property converted to agency use.  The agency at any time may transfer the property to another municipal or county law enforcement agency for the use of that agency.  The agency last using the property shall return the property to the person designated by the municipality, county purchasing agent, or sheriff, as the case may be, for disposition when the agency has completed the intended use of the property.\r\n\r\n(h)  If the abandoned or unclaimed personal property is money, the person designated by the municipality, the county purchasing agent, or the sheriff of the county, as appropriate, may, after giving notice under Subsection (b) or (c) of this article, deposit the money in the treasury of the municipality or county giving notice without conducting the sale as required by Subsection (d) of this article.\r\n\r\n(i)  While offering the property for sale under this article, if a person designated by a municipality, county purchasing agent, or sheriff considers any bid as insufficient, the person, agent, or sheriff may decline the bid and reoffer the property for sale.\r\n\r\n(j)  Chapters 72, 74, 75, and 76, Property Code, do not apply to unclaimed or abandoned property to which this article applies.\r\n\r\nActs 1965, 59th Leg., vol. 2, p. 317, ch. 722.  Amended by Acts 1967, 60th Leg., p. 1737, ch. 659, Sec. 15, eff. Aug. 27, 1967;  Acts 1973, 63rd Leg., p. 985, ch. 399, Sec. 2(E), eff.

Kwariani was, throughout his life, an actor, professional wrestler, and Parisian restaurant owner. (Born January 16, 1903 \u2013  Died February 27, 1980)\r\n\r\nProof of death is not needed as his 1980 murder in New York was widely reported. \r\n\r\nHere's a link to his IMDB page: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0477132/?ref_=sr_t_2\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about Nicholas Nestor \"Kola\" Kwariani  from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Wwariani held by the New York and San Francisco field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Mr. Kwariani.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to the wrestler Kwariani. \r\n\r\nPlease also consider this request to include bureau collection, discussion or examination of Kwariani's public appearances or media coverage. As an example, an article (https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/136086782/)  published on February 13th, 1940 in the Oakland Tribune newspaper claimed (perhaps apocryphally) that Kwariani and Joseph Stalin were childhood friends. Please include a search for bureau records that might have cataloged any personal or professional relationship between Kwariani and Stalin. \r\n\r\nIf you cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or certain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

I am seeking records relating to, or mentioning, Henry Alfred Kissinger, personally, and as well any records relating to Henry Alfred Kissinger's work in the U.S. Army, as the U.S. Secretary of State, and generally as a public figure. This includes but is not limited to his work as a national security advisor to the U.S. President in the 1960s, 1970s, and in subsequent decades. \r\n\r\nBorn May 27th, 1923 in F\u00fcrth, Bavaria, Germany, Henry Alfred Kissinger died November 29th, 2023 in Kent, Connecticut. He is well known for many things including having said: \"The illegal we do immediately, the unconstitutional takes a little longer\" in a diplomatic cable in 1975. I also request documents that include or reference this quote even if it is otherwise unattributed to Dr. Kissinger.\r\n\r\nHe was a German citizen until being stripped of his citizenship in 1935 by the Nazi regime in Germany at the time. It is reported that he was then stateless until becoming an American citizen in 1943. His death at the age of 100 was widely reported in the media in late in November of 2023. He is also known by the name Dr. Kissinger or simply Kissinger.\r\n\r\nMajor media outlets across America and internationally as of late 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/us/henry-kissinger-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Henry Alfred Kissinger.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Henry Alfred Kissinger.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Henry Alfred Kissinger.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Henry Alfred Kissinger including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nHenry Alfred Kissinger was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public. I have previously been determined to meet the criteria for a full fee waiver under journalistic and academic requester status. I am however currently waiting for a copy of that determination letter from the FBI. I am able to produce the relevant FOIA reference where this determination was made by the FBI, if that is needed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I am seeking records relating to or mentioning John Richard Pilger personally, and as well any records relating to John Richard Pilger's work as an investigative journalist and as a public figure involved in investigating many international stories in the public interest. This includes but is not limited to his political work in pledging bail in Britain for the award winning investigative journalist and at the time editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.\r\n \r\nBorn October 9th, 1939 in Bondi in New South Wales, Australia, John Richard Pilger died December 30th, 2023 in London, England. He was widely acclaimed as an internationally award winning, and extremely well respected investigative journalist. He was an Australian and a British citizen. His death at age 84 was widely reported in the media in late December of 2023 and in January 2024. He is also known by the name John Pilger.\r\n\r\nMajor media outlets across America and internationally as of early 2024 have reported his death including: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/business/media/john-pilger-dead.html \r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to John Richard Pilger.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about John Richard Pilger.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to John Richard Pilger.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on John Richard Pilger including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nJohn Richard Pilger was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public. I have previously been determined to meet the criteria for a full fee waiver under journalistic and academic requester status. I am however currently waiting for a copy of that determination letter from the FBI. I am able to produce the relevant FOIA reference where this determination was made by the FBI, if that is needed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",
