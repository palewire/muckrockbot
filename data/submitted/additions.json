The IHSC Mortality Review for Frankline Okpu, who died at GEO's Moshannon Valley ICE Processing Center on December 6, 2023; or\r\n2. the IHSC Preliminary Mortality Review.\r\n\r\nICE Policy Directive 11003.5 requires IHSC to complete and circulate the Mortality Review within 60 days after a person dies in ICE custody. See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention/directive11003-5.pdf.  A preliminary mortality review is due 14 days after the person's death. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and state under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that this video is a matter of widespread interest and (deaths in ICE and / or GEO custody) about which there exist serious questions of government wrongdoing (whether MVIPC complied with CRCL and ICE\u2019s June 2023 agreement to retrain GEO guards on documenting uses of force and updating facility video to eliminate blind spots in the camera system). Moreover, my investigation for Prism Reports has documented serious inaccuracies in ICE's publicly available reporting regarding Frankline Okpu's death that raise serious questions of wrongdoing by ICE and its contractor, GEO.\r\n\r\nI note that ICE FOIA previously granted my expedited processing request with respect to video of Mr. Okpu in the case it assigned ICE FOIA 2024-ICFO-32340.\r\n\r\nSee below.\r\nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-09/23_0620_crcl-close-summary-ice-moshannon-valley-processing-center-06-20-23.pdf\r\n\r\nhttps://wjactv.com/amp/news/local/troopers-investigation-ice-processing-immigration-moshannon-valley-pennsylvania-death-victim-police\r\nhttps://www.psp.pa.gov/PIRRs/Clearfield%20Press%20Releases/C_CLEA_11DEC2023_1530.pdf\r\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/crime/private-prisons-assaults-jeff-sessions-sally-yates-geo-20170817.html&sa=U&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwiI5d6KwpKDAxXcQzABHd63DhMQFnoECCUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2gie_C-Ia7ykVrMCcIJRME\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

A record of OPR providing the ICE Deputy Director the required 180-day update regarding Frankline's death. \r\n\r\nICE Policy Directive 11003.5 requires ICE OPR to either complete and publish the detainee death report within 180 days after a person dies in ICE custody, absent exceptional circumstances. See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention/directive11003-5.pdf.
