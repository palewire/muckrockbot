FOIA Advisory Committee September 7, 2023 Chat Comments\r\n\r\n***This Request will be timely for Judicial Review in twenty working days***\r\n\r\nI am submitting this request under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., as amended. If you deny all or any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your decision not to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law. References cited below apply.\r\n\r\nRECORDS SOUGHT VIA FOIA.\r\n\r\nExpedited FOIA Request NARA 23 -G. Muckrock. FOIA Advisory Committee September 7, 2023 Chat Comments See PDF.\r\n\r\n1.\tAll records of the September 7, 2023 Webex Chat \r\n\u2022\tRecords would include \u201call panelist\u201d chat comments as well as any direct comments to any member participating in the meeting, including OGIS support personnel and the conference moderator. This includes Committee members present at the virtual meeting. Others present or participating in the virtual meeting, including all registered participants.\r\n\r\n2.\tRecords of all persons who registered via Eventbrite to attend the meeting.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Agency copy of this FOIA Request this FOIA request itself is an agency record, \u201creceived by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied). \r\n\r\n\tThe definition of \u201crecords\u201d includes:\r\n\u201c[A]ill books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of data in them.\u201d  44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT.\r\n\r\nI am also seeking records in their native format (MS. Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, ADA accessible PDF files by return email with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records via email in PDF format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done.\r\n\r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital format in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. Emails should be provided as MS Outlook files, if not encrypted or otherwise unable to be opened by me. Only if this is not possible, emails should be produced with their embedded hyperlinked attachments by using the \u201cFile => Save as Adobe PDF\u201d command within Outlook or by other software that produces the same result.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number, and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee.\r\n\r\nThe OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat.\r\n2477 .)\r\n\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING.\r\n\r\nI certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that a compelling need exists for expedited processing as discussed below:\r\n\r\n1.\tRecords are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\na.\tFOIA Advisory Committee certified meeting minutes must be accurate. If they are not, it is explosive.\r\n2.\tAdditionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOAI meeting.

Namely, the one I'm interested in:\r\n\"The virus is primarily spread via respiratory droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, or through direct contact with a contaminated surface.\"\r\n\r\nThis does not specifically occur anywhere in public CDC materials. The issue of droplet spread of airborne diseases is at the very center of current controversy in public policy, because it's at the core of an ongoing worldwide scientific paradigm shift in the field of infectious diseases and bioaerosols.\r\n\r\nI am seeking, in the general sense, copies of discussions, emails, and records, mostly external, but also internal deliberations, regarding this article.\r\n\r\nIn the specific sense, in addition to the aforementioned records, I am seeking the discussions with reporters that contain the phrase and/or typographical variations of the phrase \"The virus is primarily spread via respiratory droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, or through direct contact with a contaminated surface\", but also, any documents/records that are used to support that claim, and any related discussions of formulating that claim as presented to the press.\r\n\r\nGiven this primarily involves copies of direct correspondence with members of the public, I do not expect complete redactions under the deliberative process principle.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The University of Pittsburgh \u2013 of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education (\u201cPitt\u201d) respectfully declines to provide the information requested below as no applicable federal or state open records law requires Pitt to provide you with the information requested.\r\nThe Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7552) is a federal law which provides for the release of documents maintained by federal agencies. It does not apply to state-related universities. Similarly, the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law (65 P.S. \u00a767.101, et seq.) specifically exempts state-related universities such as Pitt from the definition of Commonwealth agencies.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDuring written testimony submitted in a November 15, 2022, and again during a colloquy with Senator Alex Padilla at a hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Inspector General Cuffari maintained OIG launched a \u2018system-wide audit\u2019 of care in ICE detention facilities. Specifically, the written statement of Dr. Cuffari states at page 3: \r\n\r\n\u201cOur inspection did not review the gynecological procedure approval process for detainees at ICDC. Rather, we launched a separate system-wide audit, across all DHS detention facilities, to ascertain the rigor of the approval process for invasive surgical procedures, as well as the propriety of previously approved invasive medical procedures, in light of medical community standards.3\u201d https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/imo/media/doc/Cuffari%20Testimony.pdf\r\n\r\nInspector General Cuffari asserted during his exchange with Senator Padilla on November 15, 2022, that this \u201csystem-wide audit\u201d was ongoing, more than two years after the September 14, 2020, Irwin County Detention Center whistleblower report. \r\n\r\nPlease provide:\r\n(1) a copy of the Opening Memo or other, similar document describing the referral source, purpose, scope, and methodology of this \u201csystem-wide audit\u201d of DHS facilities; \r\n(2) any Report of Investigation this system-wide audit has produced, or Memoranda of Activity it may have generated. \r\n(3) any Contract DHS-OIG entered into or relied upon with outside contractors to assist in or complete this \u201csystem-wide audit\u201d. \r\n(4) any communications between Inspector General Cuffari or his designee and Congress regarding the status of this \u201csystem-wide audit\u201d. \r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request. Allegations of a pattern of unnecessary, nonconsensual, invasive, and potentially sterilizing gynecological procedures at the Irwin County Detention Center were substantiated by an 18-month, bipartisan investigation of the Senate PSI. These allegations and others relating to the ongoing, acute, deadly harms of DHS detention facilities have been the subject of widespread and exceptional media coverage. We therefore seek expedited processing under 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest to the accuracy of the statements above under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support of our expedited processing request. \r\n\r\nThese are vital records to understand what, if anything, Inspector General Cuffari\u2019s \u201csystem-wide audit\u201d concluded about care and consent for humans locked inside DHS detention facilities. The President sought hundreds of millions of dollars in supplemental detention funding from Congress without bothering to publish, much less consider, the results of this system-wide audit, in an apparent pre-determination of its outcome. Our transparency project and others we advocate alongside to push back against and contextualize the pending emergency supplemental funding request by the Biden Administration has a right to know the status and conclusions of the system-wide audit the Inspector General conducted. Timely resolution of this request is essential to ensuring we receive records in a period when they can be used to influence current policy, including the budget supplement. Untimely resolution restricts our ability to speak and advocate, violating our First Amendment guarantees of the freedom to speak and petition on matters of public concern. Why is this so? Because without transparent, timely access to records of the Inspector General\u2019s system-wide audit, only the government officials asking Congress and the American people for more money possess the potentially derogatory information that might frustrate or prevent their efforts to get it. Only the people currently in possession of government records\u2014in this case, the system-wide audit\u2014that demonstrate DHS is inflicting daily harm and preventable death upon adults and children  in detention will have real-time access to the government records the public needs to understand and accept these harms are happening. \r\n\r\nBy delaying your response to this request, you will be buying time for the system to re-formulate and strengthen itself without meaningful, evidence-based public input. That is not the democracy Congress or the Supreme Court presume to exist when interpreting the Freedom of Information Act. That is governance by secrecy under a presumption of opacity. \r\n\r\nPlease grant expedited processing to this request and release these materials as soon as practicable. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
