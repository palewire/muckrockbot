Please include Model Name, Vendor, and Date Purchased at minimum. \r\n- Audits on any voting equipment (include dates, company, costs) per M. G. L. c. 54 \u00a7 33I\r\n- Devices removed (when removed, when originally purchased, reason for removal) \r\n-Devices with serial numbers and model used in 2020 presidential election.\r\n-Devices with serial numbers and model numbers in current circulation to be used in next election/November 2022. \r\n- When the name \"Sara Cooke\" or \"Sara Breton\" occurred on voting records. Looking for dates I voted. (Please interchange, as name may include middle initial of E. or Elizabeth. For confirmation: Snipatuit Road, Pine Street, Hazel Road, Wall Street are the addresses to cross confirm).  \r\n- In Rochester, under maiden name of Sara Breton, I was a poll worker. Kindly include those dates as to when I was working for the town.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

While i dont mind paying for my FOIA request this poor excuse for an invoice seems to be excessive.\r\n\r\nThe incident itself took place over a 5 minute period and 4 cars were involved creating approximately 20 minutes of axon footage,  you are attempting to invoice for a very specific 22.38 hours of \"AXON\" video recovery with no accounting, which would imply each 5 minute body camera video would need to be reviewed 67 times consecutively to arrive at the number of hours invoiced  which seems to be an abuse of the states FOIA billing laws and standards.  Please correct your invoice so that I can submit payment, I will separately follow up with the city attorney about this seemingly fraudulent FOIA invoice.\r\n\r\n",

        "communication": " I am writing to address the fee assessment related to my recent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, filed on 08/13/2023, regarding a specific event involving the Lansing Michigan Police Department. I appreciate your prompt response to my request, but I would like to discuss the associated fees in hopes of reaching a more reasonable resolution.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand that the processing of FOIA requests requires time and resources, the estimated cost of nearly 23 hours to provide the requested 5-minute body camera footage and accompanying paperwork seems disproportionately high. I would like to kindly request a breakdown of how this cost was calculated, as well as some clarification on the factors that contributed to such a substantial fee.\r\n\r\nMy intention in submitting this FOIA request was to gain insight into a specific event from multiple perspectives, as captured by the body camera footage of the five officers involved. I believe that such transparency is important for fostering trust between the community and law enforcement agencies. While I value the dedication and effort put forth by your records department, I am concerned that the proposed fee might deter citizens from seeking access to public records in the future.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, I would like to propose a more mutually agreeable solution. I am open to discussing ways to streamline the retrieval process, such as specifying a narrower timeframe for the requested footage or prioritizing the paperwork associated with the event. I am also open to exploring alternative methods of data delivery that might reduce the processing time and associated costs.\r\n\r\nAs a responsible and engaged member of the community, I am committed to fulfilling my obligations in a fair and reasonable manner. However, the current fee assessment poses a significant financial burden that I believe could be addressed through further dialogue and collaboration. I am confident that by working together, we can arrive at an equitable resolution that upholds the principles of transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nI kindly request that you reconsider the fee assessment and provide me with an itemized breakdown of the costs involved. I am available to discuss this matter further at your earliest convenience. Please feel free to contact me via email.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your response. Your assistance in facilitating access to the requested records would greatly contribute to the constructive relationship between law enforcement and the community.",

Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to FWS's decision to create a mascot in the first place.

Please produce all Air Bear-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, videos, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books). (According to FAA records (attached), these records include coloring books, classroom materials, and a video called \"Air Bear Goes On A Trip.\")\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any life-size Air Bear costume (pictured in the attached FAA records). Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Air Bear.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all correspondence related to Air Bear (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn may have sent some responsive correspondence around 2007.\r\n\r\n6. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision by FAA to stop using Air Bear as part of its public outreach.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

All emails to/from/between Dr. Anthony Fauci and any email address originating from, or ending in, \" @mckinsey.com \" between the dates of 1/1/2020 and 1/31/2021. Please make sure to include all attachments to those emails. When providing the responsive records related to this request, please specifically certify that no other responsive documents related to this request exist.\r\n\r\nIf it is not possible for your agency to conduct a search for emails originating from a specific domain, such as @mckinsey.com, please let me know and I can provide you with a specific list of McKinsey email addresses to search for instead.\r\n\r\nBetween 4/28/2020 and 1/31/2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded $13 million to McKinsey and Company, the details of which are available here: https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75R60220P00009_7526_-NONE-_-NONE-\r\n\r\nFully understanding if, and/or how, high-ranking government public health officials like Dr. Fauci communicated with non-government consultants when shaping the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the information that was shared during the public policy-making process, is of the highest importance to the public interest. Given the impact of COVID-19 and its related policies on the United States, and on global society more generally, the requested records have deep historical significance and undeniably hold a high level of importance to the public interest. Because of that, the requested records should be made available to the public with as few redactions as possible, at the lowest fee possible, and as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested information will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and/or activities of the government during a historic public health crisis and is not primarily in my commercial interest.\r\n\r\nIn order to help determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am a freelance journalist whose work has been published by print and digital news outlets and magazines at the national, regional and local levels. You can view my portfolio at www.erinmariemiller.com/clips. I have previously been determined a media requester by federal agencies under other FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the media, I request a waiver of all fees. In the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $25 for the requested information. If the fee for this request exceeds this amount, please notify me in writing for permission prior to beginning work on the request.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nPlease send all documents related to this request to this email address.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Marie Miller",

        "communication": "Dear Records Access Officer:\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal of DOCCS's determination regarding FOIL request DOCCS-22-11-028 on May 25, 2023, as well as its determinations on April 11, 2023; March 6, 2023; January 19, 2023; and November 29, 2022. All of the determinations extended the time to respond to my request. According to the determinations, records \"potentially responsive to my request\" were identified at least as early as November 29, 2022, but have been \"under review for applicable exemptions, legal privileges and responsiveness.\"\r\n\r\nDOCCS has constructively denied my request. The repeated delays, which have now extended for more than seven months after I submitted the request on November 1, 2022, are unreasonable given the narrow scope of the request.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, OOM is required by law to provide specific reasons within 10 business days explaining why this request cannot be fulfilled in a timely manner, or else, must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by the specific date given beyond 20 business days, or if the specific date given is unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied (see \u00a789[4][a]). In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you either fulfill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial, as required by law, of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",
