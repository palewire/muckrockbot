Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, date of birth or age, job title and code, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status (e.g., classified, exempt, etc.), and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data.

The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBetsey Chace",
