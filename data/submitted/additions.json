        "communication": "Dear National Park Service:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nI am seeking records related to NPS mascot Carl S. Bat, mascot for Carlsbad Caverns National Park.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design/re-design of the Carl S. Bat mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to NPS's decision to create a mascot for Carlsbad Caverns in the first place.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Carl S. Bat-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, videos, worksheets, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any wearable Carl S. Bat costumes. (The attached screenshots from NPS's social media suggest that Carl's costume got an update sometime between 2014 and 2022, so please produce records for the different versions.) Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Carl S. Bat.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all correspondence related to Carl S. Bat (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) may have sent some responsive correspondence around 2007, and Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) may have sent some around 2019. \r\n\r\n6. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision to stop using Carl S. Bat as part of NPS's public outreach.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",
