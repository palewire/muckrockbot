        "communication": "Dera Ms. Feldman:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your October 24 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) request for records related to package theft trends across major U.S. metropolitan areas. Specially, your requested:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Statistics on reported package thefts from Seattle, San Diego, Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Austin, Denver and Portland between January 1, 2019, and the present.\r\n  2.  Policies and protocols for investigating package theft involving USPS deliveries.\r\n  3.  Communication or agreements between the USPS Postal Inspection Service and local police departments regarding theft investigations and prevention.\r\n  4.  Public outreach materials or initiatives addressing package theft prevention.\r\n\r\nThe OIG FOIA case number shown in the subject line above has been assigned to your request. Your request will be processed in the order it was received.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA provides agencies 20 working days from receipt to respond to requesters. While this office routinely meets this requirement, current workloads may require additional time to provide our final response.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA is about records we have in our possession. The FOIA provides only for disclosing federal agency records and does not require government agencies to answer questions, conduct unreasonably burdensome research, or create records. FOIA does not let you appeal any investigative decisions or ask us to research aside from searching for responsive records.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA sheds light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties. The FOIA provides that any person has a right, enforceable in court, to obtain access to federal agency records, unless such records (or portions of them) are protected from public disclosure by one of nine exemptions or by one of three special law enforcement record exclusions.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Postal Service comprises the Postal Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); the Postal Rate Commission (PRC); and the OIG; each with its own area of responsibility and individual FOIA office. This acknowledgment is on behalf of the OIG only.\r\n\r\nThe Postal Service Records Office establishes procedures to ensure Postal Service records management practices comply with both the FOIA and Privacy Act. The Records Office is the designated custodian for non-law enforcement Postal Service records; including but not limited to contracting and employment/personnel records. Additional information regarding the Postal Service FOIA program can be found at https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.\r\n\r\nThe USPIS is the law enforcement, crime prevention, and security arm of USPS, and is the designated custodian for postal records relating to Postal Service law enforcement issues. The USPIS is a federal law enforcement entity charged with enforcing the Federal statutes involving mail fraud, illegal drugs, external mail theft, and other postal crimes, including revenue deficiencies, and are responsible for safety and security of all postal employees and facilities. Additional information regarding the USPIS FOIA program can be found at Terms of Service and Legal | USPIS<https://www.uspis.gov/terms-of-service#freedom-of-information-act>.\r\n\r\nThe OIG is an independent agency, created in 1997, with oversight authority over audits and investigations of Postal and Inspection Service fraud, abuse, and misconduct. The OIG\u2019s mission is to prevent, detect, and report fraud, theft, and misconduct, and promote efficiency in the operation of the Postal Service.\r\n\r\nWhile the OIG has \u201coversight authority\u201d for activities of the above referenced entities, the OIG is a separate agency and does not have management authority over the daily operations of either the Postal Service or USPIS. In addition, the OIG FOIA office does not have access to records maintained by the Postal Service or UPSIS and cannot direct either FOIA office to release records under their control. Likewise, the OIG Deputy General Counsel has no authority to review FOIA determinations issued by the Postal Service or USPIS.\r\n\r\nBecause records related to external mail theft are maintained by the USPIS, we are forwarding a copy of your request to their FOIA office. They will issue a separate FOIA case number and respond to you directly. If you have questions regarding this referral, please contact them via email at foia@uspis.gov<mailto:foia@uspis.gov>, or in writing at:\r\n\nOffice of Counsel\r\nU.S. Postal Inspection Service FOIA/PA Unit\r\n475 L'Enfant Plaza, SW, Room 3301\r\nWashington, DC  20260\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUSPS OIG FOIA Team",
