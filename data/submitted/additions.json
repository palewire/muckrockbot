Your original request was received Tuesday, June 27, 2023 and a search was initiated immediately. I have no record of a request dated June 24, 2023 (see attached original message). Additionally, please note that requests received outside of business hours (e.g., Saturday) are processed the next business day.\r\n\r\nWe are conducting a search to determine what records, if any, are responsive to the request and their status under Vermont law. Please find more information about the University\u2019s Records and Documents Requests Policy at https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/UVM-Policies/policies/records_request.pdf and on the Vermont Legislature\u2019s website here: https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/01/005/00318.\r\n\r\nI understand from the Office of Record that some or all records in the 1970 to 1990 range you request will require the recall of physical records from offsite storage and significant time to review individual files. I estimate that there will be significant time associated with reviewing the records for the information you seek. I will provide you an estimate once our initial search is complete.\r\n\r\nBelow is a link to the University of Vermont Operating Procedure related to costs associated with records requests. If you wish to revise your original request to potentially reduce costs, you would then be welcome to submit follow up requests. Please let me know if you have any questions; my direct contact information is below.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/UVM-Policies/policies/cost_assessment.pdf\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMaureen\r\nMaureen Jennings\r\nRecords Custodian & Compliance Coordinator\r\nOffice of Compliance and Privacy Services\r\nUniversity of Vermont\r\nP: 802.656.3415<tel:802.656.3086> (direct) / E: public.records@uvm.edu<mailto:public.records@uvm.edu>\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS INFORMATION<https://www.uvm.edu/compliance/public-records>\r\nOffice of Compliance & Privacy Services<https://www.uvm.edu/compliance>     \u2022     Feedback, Comments, Questions<mailto:compliance@uvm.edu?subject=Feedback,%20Comments,%20Questions>\r\n\r\n********************CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE********************\r\nThis e-mail and any attachments may contain private, confidential, and privileged information for the sole use of the intended recipient.
