Your request has been routed to the appropriate staff within Washoe County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashoe County typically processes requests in the order of receipt. The time it takes to respond to a request will vary depending on the complexity of the request and any backlog of requests already pending. A simple request can be processed faster than one that is complex. Simple requests are typically more targeted and seek fewer pages of records. Complex requests typically seek a high volume of material or require additional steps to process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequests for communications require coordination of several departments and review of each record for confidentiality and privilege. Please consider focusing or narrowing the request in such a manner as to maximize expeditious processing.
