ICE Public Affairs communications regarding the announcement of this death. \r\n4. Communications and attachments thereto regarding the detainee death review, mortality review, and healthcare and security compliance analysis. \r\n\r\nI respectfully request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e) and hereby declare and certify under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination via edited publications. See, e.g., https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; https://atlpresscollective.com/author/free/. \r\n2. There is an urgent need to inform the public of the conditions that produced this subject's death. ICE has invested a substantial portion of its detention funds in the facilities and services provided by The GEO Group. Systems failures within GEO facilities stand to impact tens of thousands of noncitizens who will be incarcerated by ICE in those spaces. \r\n3. Deaths and other harms in ICE custody have been the subject of widespread media attention about which there is substantial evidence that government oversight of its contractors is sorely lacking.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

In these documents, Jordan Wick sends an undated letter to the FCC stating that he is a software engineer for Department of Government Efficiency who will be providing his services for free for up to 40 hours a week over 120 days. From a separate exhibit in a different case, I also know that Jordan Wick was onboarded as a full-time employee of the CFPB on March 5th.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that any outside employment would need to be approved by CFPB lawyers before it could commence. I would like to request any communications between March 5th and March 18th about Jordan WIck's work at other agencies, especially if this required approval from CFPB staff or leadership. I would also like to understand if Jordan Wick's position at the CFPB has been a paid one or if he is serving in a voluntary capacity in his role. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The Stewart Detention Center has the highest number of deaths in ICE custody of any facility in the ICE detention since FY17. \r\n2. Stewart is currently one of the most populated sites of detention in the ICE system. \r\n3. Calls to 911 in 2025 from Stewart have exceeded their numbers for any period over the past five years. \r\n4. Audio recordings of Stewart 911 calls reflect instances in which EMS units were unavailable to treat significant illnesses or injuries as a result of previous calls from the facility.\r\n5. Lack of access to timely emergency medical care threatens the health safety of people in Stewart and the surrounding community. \r\n6. ICE Mortality Reviewers have attributed lack of timely access to emergency medical care to a significant number of deaths in ICE custody. \r\n7. The records requested will shed light on whether, and to what extent, ICE is aware of the challenges posed and consequences created by its use of detention in high numbers at the Stewart facility. \r\n8. DHS-OIG, ICE OPR, IHSC, ICE ODO, Congress, and the General Accountability Office have all previously cited CoreCivic, ICE's Atlanta Field Office, and Stewart for violations of ICE's standards and contracts. \r\n9. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination through edited publications, and have previously been granted expedited processing by federal FOIA offices on this basis. \r\n10. These records are needed on an expedited basis to fill out the federal side of a piece for which I have received journalism grant funding and which will be published no later than October.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",
