Please consider the modified request below:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll internal memos/callouts regarding the implementation of \"task-based\" work sent to eligibility supervisors and eligibility workers from DPSS \"line operations\" (between 1/1/2021 and 12/31/2021). For reference, I am interested in how administrators communicated the shift from case-based work to task-based work to district office staff in 2021 (when most eligibility units shifted to a task-based system). \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This information is critical to my participation in the oversight and administration of this program.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I am requesting accommodations due to my condition. I respectfully request that all records be provided electronically via email, as opposed to portals or complex delivery methods, to ensure full and equal access to the information.\r\n\r\nScope of Request:\r\nLegislative Records:\r\n\r\nAll bills, amendments, resolutions, legislative proposals, and legislative history related to the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nVoting records of all state and federal legislators on any legislation affecting the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nMinutes, transcripts, and audio/video recordings of meetings, hearings, or discussions where the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program was a topic.\r\nPublic Records:\r\n\r\nComprehensive reports, studies, assessments, and evaluations on the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nBudget allocations, financial statements, expenditure reports, and audit results related to the program, pursuant to Connecticut Budget Transparency Laws (C.G.S. \u00a7 4-66 and related sections).\r\nAll contracts, agreements, memoranda of understanding, and intergovernmental agreements involving the administration or management of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nCorrespondence:\r\n\r\nAll emails, letters, and other forms of communication, including internal and external, regarding the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nInternal memoranda, briefing documents, policy directives, and decision-making correspondence related to the oversight and implementation of the program.\r\nPersonnel Records:\r\n\r\nNon-confidential employment records, including job descriptions, resumes, and performance evaluations, of individuals involved in the administration and oversight of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program. This request is consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a), which protects confidential personal data.\r\nOrganizational charts detailing the structure and personnel responsible for managing the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program within relevant state and federal agencies.\r\nProgram Information:\r\n\r\nAll guidelines, protocols, procedural documents, and compliance reviews governing the operation of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, as mandated by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Regulations (42 CFR \u00a7 440.180) for home and community-based services waiver programs.\r\nImplementation plans, performance metrics, outcome reports, and evaluation summaries regarding the effectiveness of the program.\r\nComprehensive data sets related to enrollment, utilization, demographic information, and outcomes of beneficiaries participating in the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nSpecial Requests:\r\nExpedited Processing: Pursuant to Executive Order 13392, which mandates the improvement of agency disclosure processes, and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), I request expedited processing of this FOIA request due to the public interest and personal impact of the information.\r\n\r\nElectronic Records: In compliance with my rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, I request that all records be provided in electronic format and sent directly to my email address. This will ensure that I can access the information without unnecessary barriers or delays.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nI request a waiver of all fees associated with this FOIA request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).

The recent response indicated that DCP does not maintain records for the ABI Waiver Program, and I was directed to the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS) for further inquiries. However, I am seeking additional clarification and guidance on potential relevant records within DCP.\r\n\r\nBasis for Appeal\r\nThis appeal is intended to confirm the scope of DCP\u2019s search and determine if there may be additional records indirectly related to the ABI Waiver Program, especially regarding consumer protection policies, fraud prevention, or provider standards oversight.\r\n\r\nClarification on Scope of Records Reviewed:\r\nWhile DCP has indicated that the ABI Waiver Program is not under its direct jurisdiction, I respectfully request confirmation as to whether any records linked to consumer protection standards, fraud monitoring, or provider services oversight for Medicaid programs were included in this search. Given the program\u2019s public interest implications, these types of records, if available, would be essential for transparency.\r\n\r\nInteragency Communications:\r\nIf DCP has been involved in any interagency consultations or communications with DSS, the Office of Policy and Management (OPM), or other state entities concerning Medicaid provider standards or consumer protection relevant to the ABI Waiver Program, I respectfully request access to those records. Should these documents reside in another agency, I would appreciate guidance on the correct contacts for a redirected FOIA request.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Confirmation:\r\nAs this request is intended to benefit public understanding of health and consumer service oversight, I reiterate my request for a fee waiver under Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d).\r\n\r\nRelief Requested\r\nI respectfully request that DCP conduct a supplementary review for any responsive records indirectly related to the ABI Waiver Program or confirm that no such records exist within DCP. If no relevant records are held, any guidance on alternative state agencies or departments that may maintain these records would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBasic Accommodation Requests\r\nTo support my full participation in this process, I request the following basic accommodations:\r\n\r\nEmail-Only Communication: Please correspond exclusively via email at AabiWR@live.com.\r\nResponse in Email Body: Include the substantive response directly in the email body, ensuring easy access.\r\nIdentification of FOIA Representatives: Please include names, titles, and contact details of representatives handling my request.\r\nAvoid Portals or External Links: Ensure all necessary information is accessible directly within the email.\r\nThank you for your attention to this appeal. If further information is required to clarify or assist with locating these records, please contact me at AabiWR@live.com.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder & Owner, ABI Resources\r\n39 Kings HWY STE C\r\nGales Ferry, Connecticut, 06335\r\nAabiWR@live.com",

This response lacks sufficient scope, clarity, and consideration of interagency communications, consumer protection standards, and broader ethical or regulatory oversight of Medicaid-funded services.\r\n\r\nUnder the Constitution of the United States, Connecticut Freedom of Information Act (C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 to 1-242), FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), and related laws, I respectfully request a supplemental review of my request, adherence to statutory transparency obligations, and proper application of accessibility accommodations.\r\n\r\nBasis for Appeal\r\n1. Constitutional Rights to Transparency and Equal Treatment\r\nFirst Amendment: The right to access government-held information ensures transparency, a cornerstone of democratic governance. Denial or incomplete fulfillment of FOIA requests obstructs the public's ability to oversee government operations involving public funds and vulnerable populations.\r\nFourteenth Amendment \u2013 Equal Protection and Due Process: The procedural failure to conduct a comprehensive search and provide clear guidance violates due process. Equal access to oversight of Medicaid programs for disabled individuals is a constitutional mandate.\r\nSupremacy Clause (Article VI, U.S. Constitution): Federal laws, such as the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, preempt conflicting state practices and require accessibility in government communications and record-keeping.\r\n2. Statutory and Regulatory Violations\r\nA. Connecticut FOIA (C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 to 1-242):\r\nRequires prompt access to public records held by state agencies. DCP\u2019s determination failed to confirm whether all records within its jurisdiction\u2014including interagency communications\u2014were thoroughly reviewed.\r\nUnder C.G.S. \u00a7 1-212(d), I request a fee waiver for this public interest request, as it seeks to advance understanding of Medicaid-funded services.\r\nB. Federal FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552):\r\nRequires a comprehensive search of all reasonably identifiable records, including interagency communications (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C)).\r\nMandates detailed explanations for determinations, including the scope of the search, offices queried, and any statutory exemptions applied (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(i)).\r\nC. Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.):\r\nRequires state agencies to provide effective communication and equal access to government services, including accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\r\nFailure to provide accommodations or clarify the scope of determinations violates federal accessibility laws.\r\nD. Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794):\r\nProhibits discrimination in programs receiving federal funding, mandating accommodations in FOIA responses, including simplified summaries and accessible formats.\r\nE. Medicaid Statute (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.):\r\nGoverns Medicaid programs, including the ABI Waiver, requiring transparency in funding, provider oversight, and program operations.\r\nF. Executive Order 13392 (\"Improving Agency Disclosure of Information\"):\r\nMandates improved FOIA processing to ensure timely, transparent, and equitable access to records.\r\n3. Failure to Conduct a Comprehensive Search\r\nConsumer Protection Oversight: While DCP states the ABI Waiver Program is not under its direct jurisdiction, I request confirmation of whether:\r\nDCP holds records on consumer protection standards for Medicaid providers under the ABI Waiver Program.\r\nAny fraud prevention, consumer complaints, or provider standards oversight involving ABI Waiver providers were included in the search.\r\nInteragency Communications: If DCP participated in consultations with DSS, the Office of Policy and Management (OPM), or other agencies regarding the ABI Waiver Program, those records must be disclosed.\r\nRelief Requested\r\nTo resolve this matter, I respectfully request:\r\n\r\n1. Expanded Record Search\r\nConduct a supplementary search across all DCP divisions for:\r\nRecords on consumer protection, provider standards, fraud investigations, and interagency consultations related to Medicaid programs.\r\nCommunications with DSS, OPM, or CMS concerning ABI Waiver Program oversight or provider regulations.\r\n2. Clarification of Initial Determination\r\nProvide a detailed explanation of the initial search process, including:\r\nOffices and databases queried.\r\nSearch terms used.\r\nTimeframes covered.\r\n3. Referrals to Other Agencies\r\nIf records are confirmed to exist outside DCP, provide a referral under C.G.S. \u00a7 1-212(b) to DSS or other relevant agencies.\r\n4. Adherence to ADA and Rehabilitation Act Accommodations\r\nNon-Negotiable ADA Accommodations:\r\nMuckRock Platform, Only Communication:\r\n\r\nAll responses via MuckRock; phone calls, physical mail, passwords, or portal responses are prohibited.\r\nDirect Text in Body:\r\n\r\nResponse text embedded in the email body for accessibility.\r\nPDF Attachments for Documents:\r\n\r\nClearly labeled and properly formatted PDFs that are screen-reader compatible.\r\nSimplified Summaries for Complex Records:\r\n\r\nIncludes summaries for ease of comprehension, ensuring all records are accessible and understandable.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel:\r\n\r\nNames, titles, and contact information of all responsible individuals (FOIA officers and supervisory personnel) must be included.\r\nDetailed Justifications for Redactions and Denials:\r\n\r\nMust include statutory explanations for any redactions or denials, in compliance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\nExpedited Processing:\r\n\r\nRequests must be processed expeditiously as mandated under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) and Executive Order 13392.\r\n5. Expedited Processing\r\nConfirm expedited processing under C.G.S. \u00a7 1-212(d) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), given the public interest and urgency related to Medicaid transparency.\r\n6. Fee Waiver Confirmation\r\nApprove a fee waiver under C.G.S. \u00a7 1-212(d) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), as this request advances public understanding of government operations without commercial use.\r\n7. Estimated Completion Date\r\nProvide an estimated completion date under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) for processing this appeal.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis appeal reinforces constitutional and statutory rights to government transparency, public accountability, and equitable access for individuals with disabilities. I trust that DCP will act promptly and comprehensively to address these concerns. Please provide a substantive response within the statutory timeframe.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder & Owner, ABI Resources\r\n39 Kings HWY STE C\r\nGales Ferry, Connecticut, 06335\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nOriginal FOIA Request (10/17/2024)\r\nDCP Response Letter (10/23/2024)\r\nInitial Appeal Submission (11/01/2024)",

These accommodations were explicitly requested to address accessibility needs stemming from my traumatic brain injury and to ensure compliance with federal law. To date, your office has failed to meet these requirements, resulting in undue barriers and systemic non-compliance.\r\n\r\nAccommodations Previously Requested\r\nThe following accommodations, explicitly outlined in prior communications, remain unfulfilled:\r\n\r\nExclusive Use of MuckRock Platform\r\n\r\nRequested: All communications must be routed exclusively through the MuckRock platform. No external portals, password-protected links, or alternate communication methods are acceptable.\r\nNon-Compliance: Communications have directed me to use external portals and password-protected links, violating ADA guidelines and my explicit requests.\r\nAccessible Document Formatting\r\n\r\nRequested: All documents must be provided as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed for ease of navigation and accessibility.\r\nNon-Compliance: Provided documents have not adhered to accessibility standards, preventing effective access to critical information.\r\nSimplified Summaries for Complex Records\r\n\r\nRequested: Simplified summaries must accompany all complex or technical records to enhance comprehension and ensure equitable participation.\r\nNon-Compliance: No summaries have been provided, creating unnecessary barriers to understanding the records.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nRequested: Each communication must include the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for processing or responding to my requests.\r\nNon-Compliance: Correspondence has consistently lacked this information, hindering accountability and effective follow-up.\r\n\r\nImmediate Action Required\r\nTo rectify these ongoing failures and ensure compliance with federal laws, I demand the following actions be taken without delay:\r\n\r\nTransition All Communications to MuckRock\r\n\r\nImmediately cease the use of external portals or non-compliant communication methods and ensure all responses are routed exclusively through the MuckRock platform.\r\nProvide Accessible Documents\r\n\r\nReformat and resend all previously provided documents as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed to ensure accessibility.\r\nInclude Simplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide simplified summaries for all complex or technical records, both previously shared and in future communications, to ensure accessibility and equitable participation.\r\nIdentify Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nInclude the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for every communication moving forward to ensure transparency and accountability.\r\nLegal Basis for Compliance\r\nYour office is legally obligated to comply with these accommodations under the following statutes and principles:\r\n\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA): Title II, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act mandate reasonable accommodations and accessibility in communications for individuals with disabilities.\r\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA): 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 requires transparency, accessibility, and adherence to procedural fairness.\r\nConstitutional Protections: The First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution safeguard my rights to petition the government, due process, and equal protection under the law.\r\nExecutive Order 13392: Mandates improved agency disclosure of information to enhance transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDeadline for Compliance\r\nYour office must confirm compliance with these accommodations and provide the requested corrective actions within five (5) business days of this notice. Continued non-compliance will be documented as a violation of the ADA and FOIA and may result in escalation, including:\r\n\r\nFormal Complaints: Filing with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office for Civil Rights.\r\nJudicial Remedies: Seeking injunctive relief and damages for ADA and FOIA violations.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Reporting systemic failures to oversight agencies, media, and advocacy organizations.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis communication serves as a final request for compliance. It is imperative that your office address these deficiencies promptly to restore transparency, accessibility, and adherence to federal law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

The handling of this request reflects systemic non-compliance with FOIA, ADA, and federal taxpayer protection statutes, undermining transparency, accessibility, and constitutional rights.\r\n\r\nThis appeal and complaint demand immediate rectification of the deficiencies, a comprehensive supplemental search, full ADA compliance, and legal accountability for the mismanagement of federally funded Medicaid programs.\r\n\r\nKey Legal Violations\r\nConstitutional Rights\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Denying access to public records infringes on my right to petition for redress of grievances.\r\nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments: Procedural delays and failure to provide accessible responses violate due process and equal protection.\r\nSupremacy Clause: Federal ADA and Rehabilitation Act obligations preempt conflicting state practices.\r\nFOIA and Connecticut FOIA\r\n\r\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 and C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.: Failure to conduct a comprehensive search, clarify scope, or justify determinations violates FOIA.\r\nFailure to Provide Justifications: DCP must cite specific statutory exemptions for withheld or non-responsive records, per NARA v. Favish.\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\r\n\r\nTitle II, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132: DCP\u2019s failure to adhere to requested accommodations (e.g., accessible formatting, MuckRock-exclusive communication) constitutes discrimination.\r\n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160: Agencies must ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities.\r\nRehabilitation Act\r\n\r\n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794: Federally funded programs must provide reasonable accommodations to ensure equitable access.\r\nWhistleblower and Taxpayer Protections\r\n\r\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8): Failure to address whistleblower claims related to Medicaid mismanagement jeopardizes accountability for taxpayer-funded programs.\r\nRelief Sought\r\nComprehensive Supplemental Search:\r\n\r\nQuery all DCP divisions for records on consumer protection standards, fraud prevention, and interagency communications related to Medicaid-funded services, including ABI Waiver Program providers.\r\nSearch terms must include \u201cABI Waiver Program,\u201d \u201cMedicaid provider oversight,\u201d and \u201cfraud investigations.\u201d\r\nClarification of Scope and Determination:\r\n\r\nProvide a detailed explanation of search parameters (e.g., databases queried, timeframes covered) and identify statutory exemptions for withheld records.\r\nReferral to Appropriate Agencies:\r\n\r\nForward the request to DSS or any other agency maintaining relevant records and provide written confirmation of the referral.\r\nCompliance with ADA Accommodations:\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Request\r\nThis request includes explicit ADA accommodations to address cognitive processing challenges resulting from my traumatic brain injury (TBI). These accommodations are legally required under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nRequested ADA Accommodations\r\nTo ensure accessibility and compliance with ADA standards (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I request the following accommodations for all communications and records:\r\n\r\nScreen-Reader Compatible Formats\r\n\r\nAll documents must be provided in properly labeled PDFs or plain-text files.\r\nEnsure the documents are screen-reader compatible and retain clear formatting.\r\nExclusive MuckRock Platform Communication\r\n\r\nAll communications must occur via the MuckRock platform.\r\nDo not send external links, emails, portals, passwords, codes, or require phone calls for access.\r\nText Embedded in Email Bodies\r\n\r\nKey information must be embedded directly in the email body to facilitate comprehension.\r\nSimplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide plain-language summaries for complex or legal documents to ensure clarity.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Officers\r\n\r\nInclude the full name, title, and contact information of all responsible officers handling this request.\r\nNon-Negotiable Compliance\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and are essential for ensuring equal access to information. Any failure to provide the requested accommodations may constitute a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Thank you for ensuring compliance and accessibility in addressing this request.\r\n\r\nAll responses must be routed through the MuckRock platform to ensure accessibility.\r\nAccessible Document Formatting:\r\n\r\nPDFs must be labeled, indexed, and screen-reader compatible, with logical organization.\r\nSimplified Summaries:\r\n\r\nProvide plain-language summaries for complex or technical records to ensure equitable access.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel:\r\n\r\nInclude the name, title, and contact information of all individuals involved in processing this request.\r\nExpedited Processing:\r\n\r\nPrioritize this appeal under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) and C.G.S. \u00a7 1-210(a), given the public interest in Medicaid transparency.\r\nConsequences of Continued Non-Compliance\r\nFormal Complaints:\r\n\r\nComplaints will be filed with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Rights Division, HHS OCR, and state oversight bodies.\r\nJudicial Action:\r\n\r\nInjunctive relief and damages will be pursued under FOIA, ADA, and constitutional law.\r\nPublic Advocacy:\r\n\r\nSystemic failures will be reported to media outlets and taxpayer advocacy groups to ensure accountability.\r\nDeadline for Compliance\r\nThis appeal requires a substantive response within five (5) business days. Failure to comply will result in immediate escalation to federal oversight authorities and legal remedies.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThis complaint seeks to uphold constitutional, statutory, and ethical obligations for transparency, ADA compliance, and taxpayer protections. By addressing these violations promptly and comprehensively, DCP can restore public trust and demonstrate accountability in administering Medicaid-funded programs.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nOriginal FOIA Request (10/17/2024)\r\nDCP Response Letter (10/23/2024)\r\nInitial Appeal Submission (11/01/2024)\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\nCC: Congressional Oversight Committees, DOJ Civil Rights Division, OGIS, and relevant stakeholders.\r\nCopies To:\r\n\r\nOffice of the Attorney General, Connecticut\r\nConnecticut Department of Social Services\r\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS)\r\n\r\nCC: Oversight and Accountability Authorities\r\nRobert F.

Records identified as responsive to your request will be reviewed, and made available for your access, in accordance with relevant law and University policy. The estimated date of production is eight weeks, though we are often able to provide records more quickly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that many of the requested records are likely exempt from disclosure pursuant to the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 954 and Code of Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2018.030(a), respectively, as incorporated into Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.705);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records containing information the University acquired in confidence and not open, or officially disclosed, to the public (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 1040, as incorporated into Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.705);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records that pertain to pending litigation to which the University is a party (Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.200);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Correspondence of and to the Governor or employees of the Governor\u2019s office (Govt. Code 7928.000\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Preliminary drafts or notes that are not retained by the University in the ordinary course of business are protected from disclosure because the public interest in withholding those records clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure (Govt. Code \u00a7\u00a7 7927.500 and 7922.000);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records that are exempt due to the deliberative process privilege under Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000. Courts have applied section 7922.000 to exclude from public review materials the disclosure of which \u201cwould expose an agency's decision-making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency's ability to perform its functions\u201d (Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1342.). The materials withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege meet the requirements that the materials are both pre-decisional and deliberative (American Civil Liberties Union of Northern Cal. v. Superior Court (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 76.);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Personnel, medical, or similar files are exempt pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.700, and personal contact information is exempt from disclosure pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000, where disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; The public interest served by withholding private personal contact information outweighs any public interest served by disclosure.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUCOP CPRA Office\n",

Attached is the first batch of 849 pages of responsive records found in a search of President Drake's emails. Please note that student names and identifying information was redacted pursuant to FERPA, and private email addresses/phone numbers were redacted for privacy purposes.\r\n\r\nMost of the remaining records you requested are exempt from disclosure as specified below. However, we will be proving you a final, 2nd batch of responsive, redacted records within 3 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.

To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nIn a recent city council meeting (https://sanmateo.primegov.com/Portal/Meeting?meetingTemplateId=8018) Amendment No. 3 to the master services and purchasing agreement with Axon Enterprise, Inc. was approved for use of a Skydio X10 drone and associated Skydio Remote Flight Deck Software. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I hereby request the following records, from Jan 01, 2024 to the processing of this request: \r\n\r\n1) Any digital communications (including but not limited to emails and text messages) as well as documents, (including but not limited to PDF, word processing, excel, and slide documents) that mention \"Skydio\", \"X10\", or \"Remote Flight Deck\". This includes communications from Skydio, Axon Enterprise, Inc., or any other external entities that may have been consulted. Please include all attachments. \r\n\r\n2) All instructional materials, presentations and presentation materials (including recorded video and audio, and PowerPoint files), and other guidance on the features and use of Skydio drones. This can exclude notes taken during meetings, but should include A) any explanations (whether internally or externally generated) of how Skydio works, and B) any other document that has been used to help explain the use of Skydio, including internal documentation, public relations materials, and executive summaries. \r\n\r\n3) A copy of any materials related to evaluation of the addition of Skydio equipment (such as possible effects on privacy impact assessments, use policies, standard operating procedures, or data retention policies) not covered by (1) (such as meeting notes not captured in email). \r\n\r\nI also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, XLS, or PPT file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nEwen Cheslack-Postava \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fsan-mateo-police-department-7497%252Fskydioaxon-communications-and-materials-san-mateo-police-department-176388%252F%253Femail%253Dpolice%252540cityofsanmateo.org&url_auth_token=AAAgEkL9-JfKayADniIhBTFArhk%3A1tDDa8%3Ao1tFXbOEGdGP7TARbPAOo6iJPl_-J13DEpQpQ9XVddA We are reaching out to inform you that a legal review of your request was completed by our City Attorney\u2019s office, in accordance with Government Code \u00a7 7922.525(b). You will find responsive communications and documents attached to this request. Please note, much of the Skydio training material is proprietary to Skydio and not retained by the Department. During this review, it was determined there were responsive records you have requested that are exempt from disclosure as determined by the following Public Records Act exemptions: \r\nGov Code \u00a7 7927.500 exempts\u00a0preliminary drafts, notes, or interagency or intra-agency memoranda that are not retained by a public agency in the ordinary course of business. These records were excluded from release. If you have any questions, please reply to this message \r\nSincerely, \r\nKelly O'Keefe \r\nPolice Technical Services Administrator \r\nPolice \r\n(650) 522-7709",

For approval recommendations that the Governor did not accept, what steps, if any, did the Governor take on the recommendation.\r\n6. For approval recommendations that are still pending at this time of this inquiry, how many days have they been pending since the Advisory Board of Pardons' recommendation to the Governor (or since what date have they been pending with the Governor).\r\n\r\nI am seeking statistical information, not personal information, so it is fine with me if applicants' names are redacted.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid Weimer",

ISP acknowledges receipt of your FOIA request received on December 20, 2024. A reasonable search for the requested records was conducted. ISP has included all responsive records that were located.\r\n\r\nISP is providing Investigative Report #22-41378100046. The requested records that ISP is providing are too voluminous to be sent via email; thus, they have been uploaded to the secure Microsoft Teams SharePoint Server and will be available for download at your convenience for the next 365 days here.\r\n\r\nFor the portion of your request concerning emails, ISP was unable to perform a search for emails based on the provided search terms. We invite you to submit a new request with more information that includes, but it not limited to, a list of keywords or phrases and date range.\r\n\r\nISP is granting your request in part and denying your request in part. The request was denied in part because some of the information in the records required redaction and/or were exempt from disclosure. The basis for the ISP\u0092s decision in this matter is as follows:\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(a) of FOIA: \u0093Subject to this requirement, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: (a) Information specifically prohibited from disclosure by federal or State law or rules and regulations implementing federal or State law.\u0094 (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(a)).\r\n\r\nDisclosure of some of the records you have requested is prohibited by federal or State law or rules and regulations implementing such laws.\r\n\r\n20 Ill. Adm. Code 1240.80(d): \u0093LEADS data shall not be disseminated to any individual or organization that is not legally authorized to have access to the information.\u0094 (20 Ill. Adm. Code 1240.80(d)).\r\n\r\nInformation gathered for the Law Enforcement Agency Data System (LEADS) cannot be provided to you because the dissemination of LEADS information to non-law enforcement persons and entities is prohibited.\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(b) of FOIA: \u0093Subject to this requirement, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: (b) Private information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law, or a court order.\u0094 (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b)).\r\n\r\nDocuments containing private information, as defined in 5 ILCS 140/2(c-5) have been redacted.\r\n\r\nSection 7.5(bb) of FOIA: \u0093Statutory exemptions. To the extent provided for by the statutes referenced below, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: \r\n (bb) Information which is or was prohibited from disclosure by the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.\u0094 (5 ILCS 140/7.5(bb)).\r\n\r\nLaw enforcement records concerning specific minors under 18 years of age are exempt from public inspection and may not be disclosed to the public except by order of the court.\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(c) of FOIA: \u0093Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u0091Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u0092 means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u0092s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy.\u0094 (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c)).\r\n\r\nDocuments containing personal information which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy have been redacted.\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(d)(vi) of FOIA: \u0093Subject to this requirement, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: \r\n (d) Records in the possession of any public body created in the course of administrative enforcement proceedings, and any law enforcement or correctional agency for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that disclosure would: \r\n (vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel or any other person.\u0094\r\n\r\nReleasing a portion of the requested records that outlines officer beat shifts or assignments would endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel.\r\n\r\nYou have the right to review by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) in the Office of the Attorney General (5 ILCS 140/9.5(a)). You may reach the PAC at:\r\n\r\n500 S. 2nd Street\r\nSpringfield, Illinois 62701\r\n(877) 299-3642\r\npublic.access@ilag.gov\r\n\r\nYou also have the right to judicial review under 5 ILCS 140/11.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSarah Wheeler\r\nIllinois State Police\r\nFreedom of Information Officer\r\n801 South 7th Street, Suite 1000-S\r\nSpringfield, Illinois 62703\r\nISP.FOIA.Officer@Illinois.gov",

Your request was received on October 22, 2024, and was assigned tracking number 25-OESPIM-0148-F. You requested the following:\r\n\r\nInformation on job listings on the USAJOBS.gov website.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires OPM to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches of multiple program offices and possible consultations with agencies that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, OPM will invoke a 10 business-day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive documents.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow OPM to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you have been categorized as a \"all other\" requester. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.103(d). In this fee category, you are responsible for search costs incurred after the first 2 free hours and for duplication costs after the first 100 pages of records are copied free. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.109(b) and (c). No fee will be assessed if the total charge for fulfilling the request will be less than $25. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.109(d)(1).\r\n\r\nA search will be initiated by OPM for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA Analyst in this office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding your request, please contact Jonathan Griffie at jonathan.griffie@opm.gov<mailto:jonathan.griffie@opm.gov>.\r\n\r\nFor additional information regarding OPM's FOIA program, please refer to the information available on our website at https://www.opm.gov/information-management/freedom-of-information-act/.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you with this matter.\r\nSincerely,\r\nFreedom of Information Act Requester Service Center\r\nOffice of the Executive Secretariat, Privacy, and Information Management\r\nU.S. Office of Personnel Management\r\nTelephone: (202) 606-3642\r\nE-mail: FOIA@opm.gov<mailto:FOIA@opm.gov>\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DB2563.4A88F040]\r\n\r\nFollow us on LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/company/opm> | Twitter<https://twitter.com/usopm> | YouTube<https://www.youtube.com/usopm>\n",

Your request was received on October 22, 2024, and was assigned tracking number 25-OESPIM-0148-F. You requested the following:\r\n\r\n1. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires OPM to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches of multiple program offices and possible consultations with agencies that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, OPM will invoke a 10 business-day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive documents.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow OPM to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you have been categorized as a \"all other\" requester. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.103(d). In this fee category, you are responsible for search costs incurred after the first 2 free hours and for duplication costs after the first 100 pages of records are copied free. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.109(b) and (c). No fee will be assessed if the total charge for fulfilling the request will be less than $25. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.109(d)(1).\r\n\r\nA search will be initiated by OPM for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA Analyst in this office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding your request, please contact Jonathan Griffie at jonathan.griffie@opm.gov<mailto:jonathan.griffie@opm.gov>.\r\n\r\nFor additional information regarding OPM's FOIA program, please refer to the information available on our website at https://www.opm.gov/information-management/freedom-of-information-act/.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you with this matter.\r\nSincerely,\r\nFreedom of Information Act Requester Service Center\r\nOffice of the Executive Secretariat, Privacy, and Information Management\r\nU.S. Office of Personnel Management\r\nTelephone: (202) 606-3642\r\nE-mail: FOIA@opm.gov<mailto:FOIA@opm.gov>\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DB25F6.A0FDC610]\r\n\r\nFollow us on LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/company/opm> | Twitter<https://twitter.com/usopm> | YouTube<https://www.youtube.com/usopm>\n",

Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI received your request for \"unedited videos\" from the Nicolae Miu case. This is NOT something I could release to you legally as all videos WILL be edited and redacted. There were many juveniles in this case and juveniles are a protected class, as well as victims who are protected under Marsy's Law. Below is the letter that explains all redactions made to all videos relating to the Nicolae Miu case. The cost to receive this request is just shy of $20 and it is far too large to send electronically. Please let me know if you are still interested in receiving the case file that was sent out to all requesters; media and otherwise, and I will send a flash drive and invoice around March. Thank you,\r\n\r\nDear Records Requester:\r\n\r\nI am in receipt of your request for records regarding St. Croix County Sheriff's Office case SO2022006400. The St. Croix County Sheriff's Office does have records that meet your request. The Spanish language interviews are included in these records.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Wis. Stats \u00a7\u00a7938.396(1)(c)2 law enforcement records involving a juvenile may be released to another party only with the written consent of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the juvenile, or the juvenile themselves, if the juvenile is 14 years or older. I did not receive a single written consent form with any of your requests for records; therefore, all videos, photos, and reports mentioning or showing juveniles under the age of eighteen have been redacted or removed from the case files prior to release. The only exception I have knowingly made is that I have kept the deceased victim, Isaac Schuman's name only intact throughout. In applying the balancing act, disclosure of this already publicly named victim outweighs the interest in non-disclosure of this information. Pursuant to Schilling v. Crime Victims Rights Bd., 2005 WI 17, \u00b626, 278 Wis. 2d 216, 692 N.W.2d 623. The public policy interest in protecting the privacy of victims of crime-especially children affected by very sensitive crimes-weighs heavily in favor of nondisclosure.\r\n\r\nWell-established public policy recognizes the privacy rights of a deceased person's surviving loved ones. Cf. National Archives and Records Admin. V. Favish, 540 U.S. 157, 168, 171-72 (2004). In preparing these records for release, the Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a) balancing test was applied, and the public interest in treating loved ones of the deceased individual with respect for their privacy and dignity outweighed any public interest in disclosure of any graphic images in photographs and videos of Isaac Schuman; therefore any images of Isaac and his family have been removed or redacted prior to release.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the balancing test pertaining to the release of law enforcement records, the harm to the public interest caused by the release of identities of victims of crimes overrides the public interest in release. Based on Marsy's Law, there is a strong public policy favoring nondisclosure of some of the requested records for the protection of the victims detailed within the reports. The policy implications as set forth in Article I, Section 9m of the Wisconsin Constitution and Wis. Stat. \u00a7 950.01 is that all victims of crimes are treated with dignity, respect, courtesy, sensitivity, and privacy. \u00a7 950.04(1v)(dr) states victims of all crimes have the following rights: (dr) to not have his or her personal identifiers, as defined in s. 85.103 (1) used or disclosed by a public official, employee, or agency for a purpose that is unrelated to the official responsibilities of the official, employee, or agency. In addition, there is a strong public interest favoring nondisclosure which outweighs the public interest in disclosure based on the potential for further victimization of the innocent victims. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)1 - 1. It shall be the public policy of this state to maintain the privacy of a record subject who is a victim of a sensitive or violent crime and access to data from a body camera used by a law enforcement officer that records such a record subject shall be provided only if the public interest in allowing access is so great as to outweigh that public policy. Our department has received no signed consent forms allowing release of these victims' private information. Records will not be released that contain personal information regarding several stabbing victims from this case.  In order to protect the privacy of the victims and respect their personal information, victim names and images have been redacted.\r\n\r\nIn performing the balancing test, I determined that the public interest in avoiding unnecessary intrusion into the personal lives of persons collaterally mentioned in a law enforcement report outweighs any legitimate public interest in information about the conduct of governmental affairs. Furthermore, I determined that the public interest in protecting the privacy of these individuals, and in facilitating cooperation with law enforcement in sensitive investigations, also outweigh any public interest in disclosure of this described information. Any notebooks, reports, computer screens, audio, or video that may contain this information may be pixelated, muted, beeped out, blacked out, blurred, redacted, or removed. Additionally, the following statutes were applied in reviewing and consideration of releasing these records:\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Dates of birth, phone numbers, driver's license number, passport numbers, social security numbers and addresses for which we have not received a waiver to release have been redacted to protect against identity theft or other unauthorized use following any subsequent disclosure. In performing the public records balancing test, pursuant to Wis Stat \u00a719.35(1)(a), I concluded that the public policy in favor of protecting the confidentiality of individual's identifiable information and preventing its misuse upon any subsequent disclosure, as well as the public polices outlined in Wis Stat \u00a7\u00a7 801.19, 801.20 and 801.21, outweighs any public interest in disclosure of the dates of birth, driver's license/state ID numbers, phone numbers, addresses or social security numbers of individual persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   \"Pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and Wis. Stat. \u00a7 146.82, the St. Croix County's Sheriff's Office is not disclosing records that contain protected health information (PHI).\" Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)2 governs people with a reasonable expectation of privacy pictured in law enforcement body camera recordings so some people's images, especially within the hospital, have been protected. Pursuant to Wis. Stat \u00a751.30 and 19.35, medical information has been redacted or omitted. Medical records may be omitted from release as outlined in Wis Stat \u00a7146.82.\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 51.30(4)(a), records related to mental health welfare checks are confidential and cannot be released except to the subject of the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Cellphone extraction records are being withheld. After conducting the balancing test, I have determined that there is a strong public interest against disclosure that outweighs the interest in disclosure in order to protect the privacy of individuals who may be included in the cellphone extraction records that are unrelated to the case/incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to 28 USC \u00a7 534, information obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Wisconsin Department of Justice that is entered into the Crime Information Bureau is not being disclosed. Specifically, 28 USC \u00a7 534(f)(1) indicates that information from national crime information databases consisting of identification records, criminal history records, protection orders, and wanted person records may be disseminated to civil or criminal courts for use in domestic violence or stalking cases. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit access to such records for any other purpose. Therefore, any information obtained from the national crime information database is redacted and not being disclosed, pursuant to the requirements set forth in 28 USC \u00a7 534(f)(1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat \u00a719.36(13), personal and business financial account information is considered personal and confidential and has been redacted. Any and all invoices and bank related reports have been removed from your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7165.79, Crime Lab analysis of evidence obtained from law enforcement officers are not subject to disclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Personal cell telephone International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers, which are economically valuable individually identifiable information, were redacted pursuant to the Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a) balancing test to protect against identity theft or other unauthorized use following any subsequent disclosure. In applying the balancing test, DOJ determined the public interest in protecting this economically valuable individually identifiable information from misappropriation or misuse outweighs any public interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the balancing test pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)2, the public's interest in disclosure of other jail inmates is not outweighed by the public interest in non-disclosure. Jail inmates who are not the subject of the record have an expectation of privacy in the jail.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any video which has been redacted to the point there is nothing of value left to release has been omitted from this release.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Public Records laws exist to ensure an open and transparent government. The personal communication of an inmate does not affect government business operations unless it involves a potential safety or security issue as identified in DOC 309.39. Although the inmate is informed of the recordings  of the calls, he or she would likely to be reluctant to communicate if these records were disclosed as a public record. This impact on communication if treated as a releasable public record would undermine the rehabilitative aspect of maintaining communication between the inmate and the inmate's family, friends, government officials, courts and people concerned with the welfare of the inmate. Open communication fosters reintegration into the community and the maintenance of family ties. It motivates the inmate and contributes to the morale and security of the inmate and staff. For these reasons the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office has determined that any of Nicolae Miu's phone calls, video logs, visitation reports, or activities from within our jail are not being released with your request for records.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere may be more information about law enforcement records pursuant to this request, but the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office is not the legal custodian of those records.\r\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions regarding the above information. If you believe the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office is withholding the requested records, you may request the St. Croix County District Attorney or the Wisconsin Attorney General to commence an action for mandamus for release of the records on your behalf. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. \u00a7 19.37(1), you may also file an action for mandamus on your own behalf.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DB5A94.6CA98430]\r\n\r\n\r\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\n\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\n\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\n\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov<mailto:Tammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:sheriffsiglogo2_1855255d-257b-4278-957c-61a991b79423.jpg]<https://sccwi.gov/>\r\n\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov\r\n\r\n<https://sccwi.gov/>",

Also, it is my understanding that several of the parties involved released their own materials. I do not recognize these videos at all. I am not certain they came from our department; however, the case file is humongous so it could be possible. Is there a reason you feel they were our videos and not the courts, or individuals that were there, or another department, such as New Richmond Police or Somerset? I will release our entire case file to you on a flash drive once I get to your name and you can determine at that time if you have the videos you need.

The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThis request is expressly limited to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's own FOIA office. Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\n\r\nP.S.

Specifically, we seek emails sent or received, calendar entries for appointments to discuss either of the deaths in custody, Teams messages, the contents of SharePoint drive folders regarding ICE's public statements regarding these deaths, and any records relied upon to assert the factual matters in ICE's post-death release statements, posted here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/brazilian-man-ice-custody-passes-away-new-mexico-hospital?s=09\r\nand here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/nicaraguan-man-ice-custody-passes-away-colorado-hospital\r\n\r\nBy definition, the information requested cannot be subject to withholding under Exemption 7A (open investigations), because ICE has already released its core facts publicly.\r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\n1.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

You had appealed an adverse determination of your request dated 1/23/2024. \r\n\r\nWe have considered your request under the both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  After review of the documents, I have determined that portions of documents will be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6 of the Privacy Act and Exemptions 7 of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 5 protects from disclosure those inter- or intra-agency documents that are normally privileged in the civil discovery context.  The three most frequently invoked privileges are the deliberative process privilege, the attorney work-product privilege, and the attorney-client privilege.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, I have determined that portions of the responsive documents qualify for protection under the deliberative process privilege/ attorney work-product privilege/ attorney-client privilege/ or all three.  The deliberative process privilege protects the integrity of the deliberative or decision-making processes within the agency by exempting from mandatory disclosure opinions, conclusions, and recommendations included within inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters.  The release of this internal information would discourage the expression of candid opinions and inhibit the free and frank exchange of information among agency personnel. The attorney work-product privilege protects documents and other memoranda prepared by an attorney in contemplation of litigation. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may consist of social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are considered personal.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nExemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I determined that disclosure of law enforcement systems checks could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist",

These sightings, widely described as \u201cmystery drones\u201d or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), have been the subject of significant public interest and media coverage.\r\n\r\nThis request specifically seeks access to all records created, received, or modified between November 1, 2024, and the date of this request's fulfillment. To ensure the identification of all responsive materials, this request includes references to \"mystery drones,\" \"UAP,\" \"unidentified flying objects (UFOs),\" \"unmanned aerial systems (UAS),\" \"unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\" \"aerial anomalies,\" or any similar terminology used to describe these aerial sightings.\r\n\r\nThe requested records include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nAudio and Video Files: All audio or video files received, recorded, or obtained by the department related to these sightings. This includes recordings made by departmental surveillance equipment, body-worn cameras, dashboard cameras, or agency-operated drones, as well as media submitted by citizens, contractors, or third parties. I request the original or highest-resolution versions of these files and associated metadata, including timestamps, geolocation data, technical specifications of recording devices, and any embedded identifiers for classification, dissemination tracking, or chain of custody.\r\n\r\nAssociated Analyses and Documentation: All investigative reports, intelligence summaries, or briefings prepared in connection with these sightings. This includes assessments of their origin, behavior, or potential significance, such as whether they posed a security, safety, or privacy threat. I also request documentation of decisions or deliberations regarding the classification, distribution, or public disclosure of information related to these events.\r\n\r\nCommunications and Directives: All internal and inter-agency communications referencing these aerial phenomena, including any correspondence that references \"mystery drones,\" UAP, or similar terms. This includes records of communications with external entities, such as contractors, private organizations, foreign governments or international bodies, and federal, state, or local agencies involved in investigating or responding to these incidents.\r\n\r\nRecords of Federal Collaboration: All records documenting referrals, consultations, or information sharing with federal agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Defense (DoD), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or any other relevant entities.\r\n\r\nIf the scope of this request is deemed overly broad, I am willing to work with your office to refine it to ensure the timely identification and release of responsive records. I also request that responsive records be provided in their original electronic format, preserving all metadata.\r\n\r\nIf any portions of the requested records are exempt under public records laws, I request that non-exempt portions be released. For any classified materials, I request a mandatory declassification review under applicable laws, including Executive Order 13526.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBill Gagnon",

Public Records Request - #PRA-2024-20946 (https://reno.streamlinegov.us/PublicRecordRequest/Detail?caseId=73072) \r\nPlease note that some or certain portions of these records are exempt from disclosure and will not be produced based on one or more of the following exemptions: \r\n \r\n  * Investigative Technique ((Confidential Law Enforcement Technique / Donrey of Nevada v. Bradshaw 106 Nev. 630,. 798 P.2d 144 (1990)) \r\n  * The names of RPD undercover officers are not included in this list.  These officers have a nontrivial personal privacy interest in having their identity protected; they did not surrender their privacy interests by swearing an oath of public office. The release of their names could subject them to harassment, retaliation and/or personal safety threats which the Nevada Supreme Court recognizes as cognizable privacy interests. Finally, the release of the officers\u2019 names is unlikely to advance a significant public interest.  Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department v. Las Vegas Review Journal, 136 Nev 733, 478 P.3d 383 (2020); See also Clark County School District  v. Las Vegas Review-Journal, 134 Nev. 700, 429 P.3d 313 (2018). \r\nYour request has been satisfied. If there are other public records you wish to review that are not covered by the City\u2019s response, please submit your request. Records in response to your new request, if they exist and are subject to disclosure under NRS 239.0107, will be made available. If you have further information or authority which you believe would require disclosure of additional records under NRS 239.0107, we will be happy to review that information and/or authority. \r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the appropriate City of Reno records office listed below. \r\nSincerely,  \r\n  City of Reno Records Division \r\n General Records (775) 348-3932 \r\n Fire Records (775) 334-2300 \r\n Police Records (775) 657-4639 \r\n Please note any confidential, proprietary, or protected information will be redacted prior to the release of the records.

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Cadostin,\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to the South Carolina Secretary of State's Office.  On July 29, 2024, our office received your Freedom of Information Act request.  At this time, we anticipate that the fee for the staff time for the search, retrieval, and redaction (if needed) of the records you have requested will be $131.09.  Pursuant to S.C. Code Section 30-4-30(B), our office will require a 25% deposit of this amount prior to searching for the records you have requested.  If you would like to proceed with your request, please remit a check or money order in the amount of $32.77 to my attention at the following address:  SC Secretary of State's Office, 1205 Pendleton Street, Suite 525, Columbia, SC 29201.  Once the search, retrieval, and redaction of the records are complete, I will notify you of the final cost for producing the records.  \r\n\r\nAlso, please note that in South Carolina, the Secretary of State's Office does not conduct elections or register voters.  That duty falls under the South Carolina State Election Commission (please see the State Election Commission's website at https://scvotes.gov/).  Our office does convene the meeting of the Electoral College every four years.  Since your request appears to be elections related, I wanted to make sure you were aware of the scope of our agency's statutory responsibility with respect to this area.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, or would like to discuss this matter further, please let me know.  You may contact me directly at swiley@sos.sc.gov or (803) 734-0246.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nShannon A.

Contracts, NDAs, manuals, and other memorandum related to the acquisition and installation of the \"Mosquito Device\" noise machine at Crossroads park2. Communications including but not limited to emails, text messages, Microsoft Teams messages, etc regarding the acquisition and installation of the device. For responsive text messages and Teams messages, please provide messages sent in the same chat within 30 minutes for context. \r\nIn order to respond to your request, we need clarification on your request as follows: 1. Could you provide a date range for your request? 2. When you say \"...acquisition and installation...\", do you mean operational emails only (internal), or do you also want us to include emails from the public? I performed a global email search using the following terms [Mosquito device, mosquito noise, sonic device, sonic devices, sonic deterrent, crossroads restroom, crossroads white paper, and mosquito] and the search returned about 7000 emails. Depending how \"acquisition and installation\" is interpreted will affect how much email is turned over to you. \r\nOnce we receive your response we will be able to provide an estimated date of release. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nHaley Havens Bellevue Public Records \r\n425-452-4283",

Parks provided this information with the record: The purchase was made using the City of Bellevue\u2019s Foreign Purchases Pro Card as it was purchase from a Canadian company. The approval and paid invoice are uploaded as the responsive record. Per the State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56.120) and City Public Records Act Rules (Section 6), a public records request may be considered abandoned and subsequently closed if a requester fails to fulfill their obligation to claim an installment of records; claim the entire production of records; inspect the records; or fails to pay the deposit or final payment for requested records within 30 days of this notification. Pursuant to the Public Records Act RCW 42.56, responsive records may be redacted or exempt. Please review the accompanying privilege log for further information, if such redactions or exemptions have been applied.\u00a0Pursuant to Section 11 of the City's Public Records Act Rules, any person who objects to the initial denial or partial denial of a records request may petition in writing (including by email) to the Public Records Officer for review of that decision. The petition shall include a copy of, or reasonably identify, the written statement by the Public Records Officer or designee denying the request and the basis for the challenge to the denial. Please mail or email your appeal to: Public Records Officer Bellevue City Hall - City Clerk's Office 450 110th Ave NE Bellevue WA 98004 Email: publicrecords@bellevuewa.gov (mailto:publicrecords@bellevuewa.gov) We estimate an update or installment will be provided on or about October 25, 2024.

You may access the responsive records provided in the Public Records Portal. Per the State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56.120) and City Public Records Act Rules (Section 6), a public records request may be considered abandoned and subsequently closed if a requester fails to fulfill their obligation to claim an installment of records; claim the entire production of records; inspect the records; or fails to pay the deposit or final payment for requested records within 30 days of this notification. As we've deviated from your original request, please advise if I should provide additional records or if this satisfies your request. We estimate an update or installment will be provided on or about November 12, 2024. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns regarding the processing of this request.

Albert Fentress is a convicted criminal who gained notoriety for his involvement in the abduction, rape, and murder of a college student in Poughkeepsie in the late 1980s. Fentress was arrested, tried, and convicted for these heinous crimes, and his case has been a subject of public interest and scrutiny for several years.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there have been further allegations against Albert Fentress, including suspicions of involvement in other unsolved cases of a similar nature. These allegations have raised concerns within the community and have sparked discussions about the extent of Fentress's criminal activities. Therefore, I believe it is crucial to access the requested records to shed light on these allegations and provide a comprehensive understanding of the investigations conducted by the Dutchess County District Attorney's Office.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nArrest records and charging documents related to Albert Fentress.\r\nCourt records, including judgments, verdicts, and sentencing information.\r\nInvestigative documents, such as police reports, incident reports, and any other documents related to Albert Fentress.\r\nCorrespondence and communications, including emails, letters, memoranda, or any other written exchanges mentioning or involving Albert Fentress.\r\nAny audio or visual recordings, such as interviews, interrogations, or surveillance footage related to Albert Fentress.\r\nAny internal memos, policies, or guidelines concerning the handling of Albert Fentress's case.\r\nGiven the profound impact of Albert Fentress's crimes on the community and the ongoing interest in understanding the scope of his criminal activities, accessing these records will contribute significantly to the public's understanding of the operations and activities of the Dutchess County District Attorney's Office.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with the applicable laws. If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific exemptions under the relevant laws.\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation.\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I firmly believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure will greatly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA or applicable state laws, I look forward to your response within the legally mandated timeframe.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\nPhone: +1 845-218-0299\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be treated in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request may be subject to public disclosure, as required by law. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.",

        "communication": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nThanks for following up on this. I am still in the process of inventorying the boxes of files on Fentress. Since this was an atypical murder case in which he is not jailed--but rather is being held under Criminal Procedure Law 330.20--his case comes back up every 2 years for review. This, in conjunction with the fact that he has been held for over 40 years, means that we have generated (and will continue to generate) an enormous amount of correspondence/communications on his case. My conservative estimate based on what I've seen so far would be 1000+ pages of communications.\r\n\r\nI don't think I'll have any issue finding the other items you're requesting, but please let me know if there are specific communications you are seeking to help narrow the search. I will give you another update next week. I at least hope to have a list of all of the documents we have by 10/20/23 and then we can figure out which ones you'd like.\r\n\r\nHave a good weekend,\r\n\nAmie\r\n\r\nAmie M.

Your commitment to providing a comprehensive list of documents by 10/20/23 is duly noted, and I eagerly anticipate the update.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued efforts, and I look forward to hearing from you next week.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

The delay in providing the requested information appears to be in violation of the FOIA guidelines.\r\n\r\nAs mandated by the Freedom of Information Act, agencies are generally required to respond to a FOIA request within 20 working days of receipt, as per 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A). The ongoing delay in fulfilling this request is inconsistent with these statutory requirements.\r\n\r\nDrawing upon legal precedents like \"NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.,\" 421 U.S. 132 (1975), which emphasize the importance of adhering to FOIA deadlines, I urge your office to provide the requested information promptly.\r\n\r\nTo avoid potential legal action, where a court might compel compliance and possibly award legal costs and attorney\u2019s fees as outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E), I request that the documents be provided no later than February 30, 2024.\r\n\r\nI hope this matter can be resolved amicably and swiftly, and I look forward to your prompt response and the release of the requested records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu",

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find his New York Post obituary at the following link: https://nypost.com/2024/11/05/business/billionaire-home-depot-co-founder-bernie-marcus-dead-at-95/\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an assistant editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

City staff have located additional records; however, said records are being withheld pursuant to\u00a0Gov. Code\u00a7 7922.000. There is a strong interest in the confidentiality of undercover officers, and\u00a0their photographs may be withheld in order to protect the safety of the officers and their families,\u00a0and to further the efficacy of the department. (Ibarra v. Superior Court (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th\u00a0695.) Based on the City's officer staffing levels, any sworn personnel (at the rank of Lieutenant\u00a0down) could be assigned to operate in an undercover capacity. Therefore, the officers whose\u00a0photographs have been withheld may be rotated into undercover positions, and the disclosure of\u00a0their photographs would similarly present safety risks to these officers and their families, as well\u00a0as prevent the City from effectively using staff resources to rotate these officers into undercover\u00a0positions. Based on the foregoing reasons, the public interest served by withholding the\u00a0information clearly outweighs any public interest served by disclosure (Gov. Code \u00a7 7922.000). Because the City will not provide the exempt information described above, the CPRA requires the\u00a0City provide a written response when a records request is denied, either in whole or in part. (Gov.\u00a0Code \u00a7 7922.540, subd. (b ).) The CPRA also requires that notification of denial of any request for\u00a0records must include the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial.\u00a0(Gov. Code \u00a7 7922.500.) With the name and title of Lieutenant J Estrada, this letter fulfills\u00a0both aforementioned legal requirements.\u00a0With this letter and the records provided, the City has concluded its response to your request. Please contact our office or Lt. Estrada if you have any questions regarding the information. Police Records Request - P000917-120924  Because the City will not provide exempt information, the California Public Records Act requires the City to provide a written response when a records request is denied, either in whole or in part. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7922.540(a).)\u00a0 The CPRA also requires that notification of denial of any request for records must include the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to Alfred Schiffer Bloomingdale (April 15, 1916 \u2013 August 23, 1982). Mr. Bloomingdale was a businessman, one-time heir to the Bloomingdale's department store chain, and co-founder of Diners Club International.\r\n\r\nAccording to a May 21, 1984 Time magazine article: \"TIME has learned that Bloomingdale had been investigated by the FBI as early as the late 1960s, when his name came up in connection with organized-crime figures in Las Vegas. About 15 years ago, Bloomingdale shelled out $5,000 in blackmail because of his habit of beating up prostitutes. Yet despite that record, he was chosen by Reagan as an appointee to the sensitive Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board in 1981.\"\r\n\r\nConfirmation of this passage can be found here: https://time.com/archive/6860378/a-mistresss-life-and-death/\r\n\r\nIn addition to the reference to a Bureau investigation in the late 1960s, Mr. Bloomingdale, as mentioned, was an unelected political appointee to the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (FSAB). All individuals who served on the FSAB were required to undergo a security background check, conducted by the Bureau, for a top-secret security clearance. This would have required the Bureau to open a file on the individual, if one did not already exist, and generate records in the course of that investigation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am requesting all FBI records for Alfred Schiffer Bloomingdale, to include all instances mentioned above, those not mentioned, and any records that may have been generated after his death.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Bloomingdale's privacy, as he passed away in 1982. A copy of his New York Times obituary, dated August 24, 1982, can be found here: https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/24/obituaries/alfred-bloomingdale-diners-club-developer-dies.html\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
