Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

You requested the following records: I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021. On behalf of the District and the Records Department, I want to apologize for the delay in acknowledging your request and the delay in getting you your first installment of responsive records.\u00a0 As stated, the District received your request on Tuesday, December 13th. The students and most employees in the District began their winter break on the afternoon of Friday, December 16th. The District's administration building was open for business on the following week but was closed from December 26th until January 3 rd. Not to make excuses but the only thing I can figure is that your request got mixed in with others the District is currently working to answer for copies of public records requests the District received\u00a0in 2019 and 2020.\u00a0 Again I apologize\u00a0for the delay and confusion. The District understands that you do not wish the District to use the GovQA platform when answering your request. The District will be sending responsive records to the e-mail address provided but it will also be utilizing the GovQA platform so that it can track all of its records\u00a0request related correspondence. Attached please find the first installment of responsive records to your request. You can expect the next installment in the next twelve\u00a0working days.

You requested the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021.\r\n\r\nRichland School District has identified and located records responsive to your request.  An installment to your public records request is now available. The District understands that you do not wish the District to use the GovQA platform when answering your request. The District will be sending responsive records to the e-mail address provided but it will also be utilizing the GovQA platform so that it can track all of its records request related correspondence. Attached please find an installment of responsive records to your request. You can expect the next installment in the next twelve working days. As you may know, while the public records laws in Washington State are very broad and presume disclosure, they do not require a public agency to create a record to answer a request.  Therefore, if the District has records that answer your request, it will provide them to you as requested. Please log in to the Public Records Request Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nThe District acknowledges your request to \"provide all identified public records in their NATIVE format.\" Some information in identified public records require redaction. The District's redaction software requires all attachments to be in PDF format. Therefore, any document requiring redaction will be in PDF format, which may or may not be native format. All redactions will be listed on a redaction log. Also, some attachments not requiring redaction have been converted to PDF to reduce file size as you have requested the District to \"provide all records electronically via direct email attachment...\".\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to receive documents in native format, it will increase the Districts response time and could incur additional fees.\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request - R000186-010623<https://rsdwa.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/RequestEdit.aspx?rid=344&coid=7BFE0C48206CDD>\r\n\r\nBeginning December 1, 2022 the District will be charging for all public records requests.  Please see our policy and procedures for our fee schedule https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820578  and  https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820577\r\n\r\nIf I have misunderstood your request in any way or you have any questions, please reply to this email.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKelsey Greenough\r\nLegal\r\n\r\n\r\nKelsey Greenough\r\nRecords Specialist",

The NH legislature amended the law effective January 1, 2021 and the NH DHHS Parental Reimbursement Unit (PRU) ceased seeking court orders for reimbursement of costs. There are no current policies in place nor were there written policies prior to the change in the law. The PRU would operate under the several parental reimbursement statutes and seek to obtain court orders for reimbursement. The PRU did have utilize a calculation worksheet in order to calculate a payment amount to recommend to the judge. I've attached the worksheet. Policies.\r\n\r\nWith regard to your request b, reimbursement recovered for the cost of residential care was not separated or distinguished from collections overall.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request.

Thank you.\r\n---\r\nOn Nov. 1, 2022:\r\nSubject: California Public Records Act Request: Automated License Plate\r\nReaders (Azusa Police Department)\r\nDear Custodian of Records:\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records\r\nAct (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the\r\nassistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate\r\nReaders (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency\r\nshares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency\r\nreceives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency\r\nshares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency\r\nreceives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for\r\nextraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant\r\nSolutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the\r\nData Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is\r\navailable through the transparency portal function. Other software, such\r\nas BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this\r\ninformation (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has\r\ninterpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does\r\nnot exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be\r\nexported through software your agency has already purchased, and is\r\ntherefore subject to CPRA. \r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the\r\nfollowing records: \r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other\r\ncertifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with\r\nSec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents\r\nare also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a\r\nCalifornia law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other\r\ncertifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec\r\n1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the\r\nperiods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information\r\nrequested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and\r\nwould require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans)\r\nand \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the\r\ndate this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period\r\nshorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on\r\nyour retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not\r\nhave this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date\r\nthis request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter\r\nthan 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your\r\nretention period.\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through\r\nthe ALPR software you use.

As noted above, this information exists within your\r\nsystem and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California\r\nPublic Records Act\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location\r\nin which the records exist.\r\nC2.

See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430\r\n(2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable\r\nsearch and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a\r\nlarge volume of records. \r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by\r\nproviding all the requested records or by providing a written response\r\nsetting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or\r\nredacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made\r\navailable. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask\r\nthat you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding\r\ndifferently compared to the many others that have complied with our\r\nrequest. \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be\r\nprovided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid\r\ncopying costs.\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the\r\ndirect costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for\r\ncopying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed\r\n$25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their\r\nrelease, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the\r\ndocuments or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also\r\nprovide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees\r\nare less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as\r\nsoon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any\r\nquestions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will\r\nhelp identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not\r\nhesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org.

Pursuant to HB1912 from the 2021 General Assembly Session, DJJ no longer requests financial support of any kind from parents/legal guardians of incarcerated youth. Consequently, there is nothing to be provided in response to part (a) of your request.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) were responsible for assessing the amount that DJJ charged families for the time their youth are in its custody, and for collecting any amount due. DSS takes an administrative fee out of that amount and sends the remaining balance to DJJ. I attach a pdf file (one page) which sets out the net amounts which DSS provided to DJJ in Financial Year 2021.

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2020.\r\n\r\nThese records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2020.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

Your e-mail listed the date of November 18, 2022 as the original date you sent it.  I did not recall receiving your request.  In researching your request, I have learned that the District actually received it on December 1st.  The District apologizes for the late response to your request.\r\n\r\nYou have requested the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2022.\r\n\r\nThese records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2022.\r\n\r\n2.

Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2021.\r\n\r\n3. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2020.\r\n\r\nThese records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2020.\r\nThe District has already requested the responsive records from the District\u2019s IT Department.  The District will be working with the IT Department to begin providing responsive records as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nYour request seeks, \u201c\u2026any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nI understand \u201cprovided by your agency\u2026to employees, contractors\u201d to mean hotspots and other related access points provided to individuals away from the District\u2019s property, schools, offices, worksites, etc. This would excluded those hotspots installed in the District\u2019s brick buildings and portable classrooms and officers that are unable to access the District\u2019s Wi-Fi. Please let me know if I am misunderstanding your request.\r\n\r\nI estimate the District will have the first installment of responsive records to you by Wednesday, January 4, 2023. This estimate is based on the number of public records requests the District is currently answering, the fact that it is winter break and all of the schools and many of the departments are enjoying vacation time, that there are two legal holidays in the next two weeks, and that the District\u2019s Records Specialist will be starting a planned leave in the New Year. If available before January 4th, I will provide them to you.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand you do not wish to receive responsive records through a third party \u201cportal\u201d, the District uses GovQA to accept, track and answer all public records requests.  Therefore the District will be using it to track your request. So while the District\u2019s correspondence and responsive records will be sent to you through this e-mail address, you will also be receiving the same from GovQA.\r\n\r\nThe District apologizes for the late response to your December 1, 2022 request. The District received several records requests through Muckrock on and around that date. Your request must have been mixed with the other requests.\r\n\r\nBeginning December 1, 2022 the District will be charging for all public records requests.  Please see our policy and procedures for our fee schedule https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820578  and  https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820577\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if I misunderstood your request in any way.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGalt L.

Your e-mail listed the date of November 18, 2022 as the original date you sent it.\u00a0 I did not recall receiving your request.\u00a0 In researching your request, I have learned that the District actually received it on December 1 st.\u00a0 The District apologizes for the late response to your request. \nYou have requested the following records: 1. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2022. These records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information. Also include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2022. 2. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2021. These records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information. Also include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2021. 3. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2020. These records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information. Also include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2020. The District has already requested the responsive records from the District\u2019s IT Department.\u00a0 The District will be working with the IT Department to begin providing responsive records as soon as possible. \nYour request seeks, \u201c\u2026 any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public\u2026\u201d \nI understand \u201cprovided by your agency\u2026to employees, contractors\u201d to mean hotspots and other related access points provided to individuals away from the District\u2019s property, schools, offices, worksites, etc. This would excluded those hotspots installed in the District\u2019s brick buildings and portable classrooms and officers that are unable to access the District\u2019s Wi-Fi. Please let me know if I am misunderstanding your request. \nI estimate the District will have the first installment of responsive records to you by Wednesday, January 4, 2023. This estimate is based on the number of public records requests the District is currently answering, the fact that it is winter break and all of the schools and many of the departments are enjoying vacation time, that there are two legal holidays in the next two weeks, and that the District\u2019s Records Specialist will be starting a planned leave in the New Year. If available before January 4 th, I will provide them to you. \nWhile I understand you do not wish to receive responsive records through a third party \u201cportal\u201d, the District uses GovQA to accept, track and answer all public records requests.\u00a0 Therefore the District will be using it to track your request. So while the District\u2019s correspondence and responsive records will be sent to you through this e-mail address, you will also be receiving the same from GovQA. \nThe District apologizes for the late response to your December 1, 2022 request. The District received several records requests through Muckrock on and around that date. Your request must have been mixed with the other requests. Beginning\u00a0December 1, 2022 the District will be charging for all public records requests.\u00a0 Please see our policy and\u00a0procedures\u00a0for our fee schedule https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820578\u00a0 and \u00a0https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820577 If you have any questions or if i have misunderstood your request in any way, please let me know by responding to this email.

The District assigned your request with the reference number R000184-122022 for tracking purposes.\u00a0 Please use this number when communicating about your request. You requested the following records: \u201c1. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2022. \n\nThese records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. \n\nAlso all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information. \n\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2022. \n\n2.

The District has been producing records related to its \"hotspots\". In researching your request with the IT Department, it was determined that there are no other physical devices that answer your request. The District has interpreted your request to be for records related to district access devices that are loaned to employees, contractors, students or the general public to access the internet. These hotspots are provided to schools and students on an as needed basis. The District does not interpret your request to include cellphones as an access device.\u00a0 Please let the District know if you intend to include cellphones in your request. Also after researching your request, I have learned that there are no e-mail addresses associated with the hotspots. Part of your request seeks usage logs. The IT Department has informed me that the District does not have any usage logs. Do you wish for the district to request the usage logs from our vendor? Your request was also requesting reports of any theft or misuses of the access devices. I have been informed by the IT Department that the District does not track misuses by the device. If there is a theft, it would have been noted on the spread sheet in the District's first installment. If the District misinterpreted your request in any way or if you have any questions, please reply to this email. Thank you for your attention.

Further, the District does not loan any hotspots to contractors or the general public, so there are no responsive records to that part of your request. Yesterday, I met with the Director of IT and he has assured me that none of the District\u2019s hotspots have an e-mail address associated with them.\r\n\r\nStarting in November, the District began receiving several public records requests through the MuckRock portal.  At the time, I did not understand that MuckRock was a portal for requestors to use to make public records requests. I wrongly believed it was an organization. Until this mistake was brought to my attention, I directed the District\u2019s Records Clerk to prioritize the first request the District had received from MuckRock. In this way the District would answer the MuckRock requests in the order that it received them. Clearly this was an error on my part since requests from MuckRock are from different individuals and are not from the same requestor.\r\n\r\nWhile your request was dated November 18, 2022, the District did not receive it until December 1st. When your request was received, it was either overlooked or incorrectly included with those the District had received in November. Either way, it was not acknowledge until December 20th and for that I apologize.\r\n\r\nIn December, the District began charging fees associated with responding to records requests.  While the fees are modest, they are part of the District\u2019s records policy. The District is uniformly applying these fees. Due to the delay in responding to your request, the District is waiving the fees. Again, I apologize for the delay in getting you all of the records that answer your records.\r\n\r\nThe District has e-mailed you all of the records that respond to your request. This concludes the District\u2019s response to your request. If I have misunderstood your request in any way or if you have any questions, please let me know.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGalt L.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1.

With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2.

Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years.

Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied.

        "communication": "Dear Dave Maass, \nThe City of Gilroy, City Clerk\u2019s Office received the below records request from you on January 11, 2023 for records pursuant to the California Public Records Act, Government Code section 6250 et seq. (\u201cPRA\u201d) and the Gilroy Open Government Ordinance (\u201cOGO\u201d). \n \"Dear Custodian of Records:\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.

A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years.

        "communication": "Dear Dave Maass, \nThe City of Gilroy, City Clerk\u2019s Office received the below records request from you on January 11, 2023 for records pursuant to the California Public Records Act, Government Code section 6250 et seq. (\u201cPRA\u201d) and the Gilroy Open Government Ordinance (\u201cOGO\u201d). \n \"Dear Custodian of Records:\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \nAmerican Canyon Police Department\nAuburn Police Department\nBakersfield Police Department\nBeaumont Police Department\nBell Gardens Police Department\nBell Police Department\nBelvedere Police Department\nBeverly Hills Police Department\nBrawley Police Department\nBrentwood Police Department\nBuena Park Police Department\nBurbank Police Department\nCarlsbad Police Department\nCathedral City Police Department\nChino Police Department\nChula Vista Police Department\nCitrus Heights Police Department\nClaremont Police Department\nClayton Police Department\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\nCoronado Police Department\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\nCypress Police Department\nEl Segundo Police Department\nFairfield Police Department\nFolsom Police Department\nFontana Police Department\nFresno Police Department\nFullerton Police Department\nGalt Police Department\nGarden Grove Police Department\nGardena Police Department\nGlendale Police Department\nHemet Police Department\nHermosa Beach Police Department\nImperial Police Department\nIrvine Police Department\nLa Habra Police Department\nLa Mesa Police Department\nLa Verne Police Department\nLaguna Beach Police Department\nLivermore Police Department\nLodi Police Department\nLong Beach Police Department\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\nMartinez Police Department\nMerced Police Department\nMill Valley Police Department\nModesto Police Department\nMonterey Park Police Department\nNewport Beach Police Department\nOakley Police Department\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\nOrange Police Department\nPalm Springs Police Department\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\nPasadena Police Department\nPleasant Hill Police Department\nPomona Police Department\nRedlands Police Department\nRedondo Beach Police Department\nRipon Police Department\nRoseville Police Department\nSalinas Police Department\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\nSan Diego Police Department\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\nSausalito Police Department\nSimi Valley Police Department\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\nStockton Police Department\nTiburon Police Department\nTorrance Police Department\nTracy Police Department\nTustin Police Department\nWest Sacramento Police Department\nWestminster Police Department\nWoodland Police Department\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDave Maass\nDirector of Investigations\nElectronic Frontier Foundation\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fgilroy-police-department-19464%252Fautomated-license-plate-readers-gilroy-police-department-136231%252F%253Femail%253DThai.Pham%252540ci.gilroy.ca.us&url_auth_token=AABuCzHngmyg6jjB6_qONaMl33M%3A1pDTbA%3AQu659BLIZ1y1ooXAk-UEZA2gx56uqGOBRAYu8mm5ypg\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\nUHAMNMWE\nFiled via MuckRock.com\nE-mail (Preferred): 136231-61585200@requests.muckrock.com\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\nMuckRock News\nDEPT MR 136231\n263 Huntington Ave\nBoston, MA 02115\n\" \nThe City of Gilroy has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request. \nPlease log in to the Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve the appropriate responsive documents.

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nThere are indications the version of the Attorney General's decision in Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018), has been edited since the Attorney General issued it. Accordingly, please produce these records as soon as possible: \r\n \r\nAny correspondence dated between June 10, 2018 and the date this request is processed mentioning \"Matter of A-B-\" for the following custodians: James McHenry, Mary Beth Keller, Anthony Murry, Katherine Reilly, Mary Cheng, Marlene Wahowiak, or Kate Sheehey. \r\n\r\nThis request is explicitly intended to include other forms of correspondence, including paper notes, letters, or memoranda. The attachments to any responsive e-mail messages should also be produced. \r\n\r\nTo clarify my request, I seek all responsive records regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics. In conducting the search, please understand the terms \u201crecord,\u201d \u201cdocument,\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d in their broadest sense, to include any written, typed, recorded, graphic, printed, or audio material of any kind. We seek records of any kind, including electronic records, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs, as well as letters, emails, facsimiles, telephone messages, voice mail messages and transcripts, notes, or minutes of any meetings, telephone conversations or discussions. My request includes any attachments to these records, including e-mail attachments. No category of material should be omitted from search, collection, and production.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business. You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, 827 F.3d 145, 149\u201350 (D.C. Cir. 2016); cf. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Kerry, 844 F.3d 952, 955\u201356 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\r\n\r\nIt is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, No. 14-cv-765, slip op. at 8 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2016).\r\n\r\nIn addition, please note that in conducting a \u201creasonable search\u201d as required by law, you must employ the most up-to-date technologies and tools available, in addition to searches by individual custodians likely to have responsive information. Recent technology may have rendered DHS\u2019s prior FOIA practices unreasonable. In light of the government-wide requirements to manage information electronically by the end of 2016, it is no longer reasonable to rely exclusively on custodian-driven searches. Presidential Memorandum\u2014Managing Government Records, 76 Fed. Reg. 75,423 (Nov. 28, 2011), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/28/presidentialmemorandum-managing-government-records; Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments & Independent Agencies, \u201cManaging Government Records Directive,\u201d M-12-18 (Aug. 24, 2012), https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/m-12-18.pdf.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, agencies that have adopted the National Archives and Records Agency (NARA) Capstone program, or similar policies, now maintain emails in a form that is reasonably likely to be more complete than individual custodians\u2019 files. For example, a custodian may have deleted a responsive email from his or her email program, but DHS\u2019s archiving tools would capture that email under Capstone. Accordingly, I insist that the USCIS use the most up-to-date technologies to search for responsive information and take steps to ensure that the most complete repositories of information are searched. I am available to work with you to craft appropriate search terms.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1974). The index must describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity \u201cto permit a reasoned judgment as to whether the material is actually exempt under FOIA.\u201d Founding Church of Scientology v. Bell, 603 F.2d 945, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Moreover, the index \u201cmust describe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of disclosing the sought-after information.\u201d King v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 223\u201324 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Further, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d Id. at 224 (citing Mead Data Central, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).\r\n\r\nIn the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records. If it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Mead Data Central, 566 F.2d at 261. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including prompt litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the USCIS is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable. To ensure that this request is properly construed, that searches are conducted in an adequate but efficient manner, and that extraneous costs are not incurred, I welcome an opportunity to discuss this request with you before you undertake your search or incur search or duplication costs. By working together at the outset, we can decrease the likelihood of costly and time-consuming litigation in the future. If it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request: \r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k), I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this request for records. The subject of this request concerns the operations of the federal government, and the disclosures will likely contribute to a better understanding of relevant government procedures by the general public in a significant way. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the request is entirely and fundamentally for non-commercial purposes. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(ii).\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested information is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i); see also 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv). The Attorney General's decision rewrote asylum law and made it incredibly difficult for asylum applicants to succeed. In doing so, the Attorney General also expressed an opinion about the eligibility for asylum for a large swath of applicants unrelated to the claim in Matter of A-B-. The decision has already had a substantial effect on asylum approval rates nationwide. \r\n\r\nI am also a member of the news media and have written and researched immigration court practice and procedures, including specifically developments in docketing procedures since the change in administration, and I request that all search and production fees be waived due to my news media status. See e.g. https://www.law360.com/articles/1050952/foia-documents-shed-light-on-eoir-case-management (referencing my writing and research on docketing procedure changes); https://www.aila.org/infonet/eoir-foia-response-no-dark-courtrooms-policy (same); https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/scanning-immigrants-old-fingerprints-us-threatens-to-strip-thousands-of-citizenship/2018/06/13/2230d8a2-6f2e-11e8-afd5-778aca903bbe_story.html?utm_term=.c59c400f0ef7 (referencing my research and writing on denaturalization procedures); https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/us-may-strip-citizenship-cheats-of-their-passports-lwt7kddq0 (same); http://www.recorder.com/US-goes-after-naturalized-immigrants-with-criminal-records-18780878 (same). I am quoted in a number of the articles listed above and intend to use the documents and information received in response to this request to share with the public and to write related news articles about immigration enforcement efforts.\r\n\r\nExpedite Request: \r\nPursuant to 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1) I am requesting the processing and production of records in response to this request be expedited. In particular, directions from EOIR administrative staff controlling the decisions Immigration Judges are to enter is of extreme importance, because it implicates issues of due process and fair play in all pending removal proceedings.  Finally, as outlined above, this is a matter of \"widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" For all such reasons, the agency should expedite its request and produce the requested records at once.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatthew Hoppock\n\n",

A complex request can take substantial time and cause significant impact on responding units. Complications and delays are likely. Records sought are massive in volume. Multiple organizations must review/coordinate on requested records. Records are classified; originated with a nongovernment source; are part of the Air Force\u2019s decision-making process; or are privileged. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n               We estimate we will provide a response to your request within 30 working days. Our policy is to process requests within their respective tracks in the order in which we receive them. FOIA requests are processed as quickly as possible. We will advise you if we cannot provide a response within the FOIA statutory timeline.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n                We have placed you in the \"Commercial\" Fee category for processing.  Under this category, you may be charged for all search, review and duplication (paper) costs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDue to the stipulation of the FOIA publication, DODR 5400.7/AFMAN 33-302, we must inquire if you are willing to accept a clearly releasable copy of the requested record(s).  A clearly releasable copy is one which can contain redactions, should it be determined some of the record(s) or portions thereof are not clearly releasable.  In requesting a contract or contract-related documents, please advise whether you will accept a redacted format that removes all trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information before being released {Information of individuals is redacted to protect personal information that, if released, would constitute clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, information from third party submitters is redacted to protect trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential from unauthorized release}, or any information that falls under the 9 exemptions or contains privacy information, i.e. names.  The redacted portions (if any) of responsive documents are removed without listing the exemption codes. This process does not require IDA approval or legal review and will be considered a full release.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso, I just want to inform you a clearly releasable copy,:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n             -You will not get an official denial letter from the Initial Denial Authority (Thus, taking less time).\r\n\r\n             -Responsive Records will be redacted of all personal names.\r\n\r\n             -Responsive Record redactions will have no FOIA Exemption code.\r\n\r\n             -You will not have appeal rights; however, you may submit a new request for ALL the records not agreeing to CLEARLY RELEASABLE responsive records.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease respond to us by COB 16 November 2022 and advise of your willingness to accept a clearly releasable copy and clarification on the requested information or the request will be Administratively Closed for failure to respond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBernice Winn\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBase FOIA/Privacy Manager\r\n\r\n78 ABW/SCPDK\r\n\r\n205 Perry Street, Ste 100\r\n\r\nRAFB, GA 31098\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDSN 468-2875, COMM 478-926-2875\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n***Currently teleworking.

        "communication": "Dear Public Records Custodian,\r\n\r\nThis is a request for public records under the California Public Records Act (CPRA).\r\n\r\nUnder SB 978, a law passed in 2018, \"each local law enforcement agency shall conspicuously post on their Internet Web sites all current standards, policies, practices, operating procedures, and education and training materials that would otherwise be available to the public if a request was made pursuant to the California Public Records Act.\"* I was unable to locate the Stockton Unified School District Police Department documents on its website. \r\n\r\nPursuant to CPRA, I request the following records: \r\n\r\nAll current standards, policies, practices, operating procedures, and education and training materials in use by the Stockton Unified School District Police Department\r\n\r\nIf these records are already available online, please provide me with the direct links to them. Otherwise, I would prefer these records in an electronic format. \r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10.  However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of police practices. As the Senate Rules Committee wrote in its May 26, 2018 floor analysis**: \r\n\r\n\"Making regulations of law enforcement agencies easily accessible to the public helps educate the public about law enforcement policies, practices, and procedures, increases communication and community trust, and enhances transparency while saving costs and labor associated with responding to individual requests for this information.\"\r\n\r\nThis information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe California Public Records Act requires a response within 10 business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nI can be reached via email at the email address listed on this request.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nStanford University Libraries\r\n\r\nRelevant links\r\n* https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=13650\r\n\r\n* * https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB978#",

This could also apply to oil companies incorporated abroad, such as UK-based GulfSands, which recently reiterated its intention to protect its rights over oil fields in Syria [https://syrianobserver.com/EN/features/60493/british-company-concerned-over-its-oil-rights-in-northeastern-syria.html].\r\n\r\n- Any and all all active licenses to engage in transactions related to petroleum, gas or petroleum products of Syrian origin as of October 8, 2020. In particular, we would like to obtain a copy of OFAC Lic.# SY-2019-363130, which was reportedly granted to Delta Crescent Energy. There have also been unconfirmed reports (https://al-akhbar.com/ArticleFiles/20197151112056636987498800565178.pdf; https://taskandpurpose.com/news/trump-syria-oil-production) about Moti Kahana's Global Development Corporation (GDC) having been nominated by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Council (SDC) to represent it in oil sales in January 2019. Please provide us with a copy of licences issued to GDC or request for licences submitted by the company (if any). \r\n\r\nIn October 2017, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) took control of Al-Omar oil field in Deyr al-Zour Province, which is the largest oil field in Syria. Since then there have been multiple reports about purported oil deals between US companies and the Kurdish-led administration.  \r\n\r\nAs SyriaUntold (www.syriauntold.com), a European Endowment for Democracy (EED)-funded Syria-focused journalistic platform, we are seeking expedited processing of our request pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) because not doing so \"could reasonably be expected to pose a threat to the life or physical safety of an individual\". In particular, a wave of assassinations have targeted Arab tribal leaders in the last months in eastern Syria, in an escalation that could be linked to undisclosed details of the aforementioned deal with Delta Crescent Energy. The announcement of this purported deal, whose details are still obscure, have prompted the Syrian Democratic Forces' regional competitors (Turkey and the Syrian government) to condemn it. All these players are likely to ramp up hostile activities against the Kurdish-led administration by mobilising segments of the population who feel excluded from the beneficiaries of a deal signed behind closed doors. Hence, the importance of transparency and of our investigataion on oil deals, in order to inform Syrian and international audiences.  \r\n\r\nThe Syrian public has an urgent need to understand a deal that concerns the future of their country's natural resources, and to identify the beneficiaries of such agreement. Especially since officials of the Kurdish-led administration have not commented officially on this, with some even questioning the existence of an actual deal (https://syriafiles.net/en/dirar-to-syria-files-sdf-not-authorized-to-sign-oil-contracts-russia-is-assads-guarantor/). \r\n\r\nWe are a group of international and Syrian journalists working on this story, and we are requesting this information in that editorial capacity. The outcome of this work will be published in English and Arabic, and shared across multiple platforms on traditional and social media. SyriaUntold has collaborated with several other regional and international media platforms, including OpenDemocracy, the Network of Iraqi Reporters for Investigative Journalism, Pan Arab Al-Hayat newspaper and UPI press agency. According to a 2017 study published by the SKeyes Center for Media and Cultural Freedom at the Samir Kassir Foundation, SyriaUntold stood out as one of the most accurate Syrian outlets for its attention to multiple sourcing in its stories. In addition to expedited processing, we request to be properly classified as a news media requester.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about our media status, please contact us.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSyriaUntold",

In particular, we would like to obtain a copy of OFAC Lic.# SY-2019-363130, which was reportedly granted to Delta Crescent Energy. There have also been unconfirmed reports (https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://al-akhbar.com/ArticleFiles/20197151112056636987498800565178.pdf; https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://taskandpurpose.com/news/trump-syria-oil-production) about Moti Kahana's Global Development Corporation (GDC) having been nominated by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Council (SDC) to represent it in oil sales in January 2019. Please provide us with a copy of licences issued to GDC or request for licences submitted by the company (if any).In October 2017, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) took control of Al-Omar oil field in Deyr al-Zour Province, which is the largest oil field in Syria. Since then there have been multiple reports about purported oil deals between US companies and the Kurdish-led administration.As SyriaUntold (https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=www.syriauntold.com), a European Endowment for Democracy (EED)-funded Syria-focused journalistic platform, we are seeking expedited processing of our request pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) because not doing so \"could reasonably be expected to pose a threat to the life or physical safety of an individual\". In particular, a wave of assassinations have targeted Arab tribal leaders in the last months in eastern Syria, in an escalation that could be linked to undisclosed details of the aforementioned deal with Delta Crescent Energy. The announcement of this purported deal, whose details are still obscure, have prompted the Syrian Democratic Forces' regional competitors (Turkey and the Syrian government) to condemn it. All these players are likely to ramp up hostile activities against the Kurdish-led administration by mobilising segments of the population who feel excluded from the beneficiaries of a deal signed behind closed doors. Hence, the importance of transparency and of our investigataion on oil deals, in order to inform Syrian and international audiences.The Syrian public has an urgent need to understand a deal that concerns the future of their country's natural resources, and to identify the beneficiaries of such agreement. Especially since officials of the Kurdish-led administration have not commented officially on this, with some even questioning the existence of an actual deal (https://hyperlink.services.treasury.gov/agency.do?origin=https://syriafiles.net/en/dirar-to-syria-files-sdf-not-authorized-to-sign-oil-contracts-russia-is-assads-guarantor/).We are a group of international and Syrian journalists working on this story, and we are requesting this information in that editorial capacity. The outcome of this work will be published in English and Arabic, and shared across m (Date Range for Record Search: From 10/1/2017 To 10/8/2020) Your request has been assigned to theOffi ce of Foreign Assets Control (O FAC).

Please be advised that our review and redaction of records responsive to FOIA requests are not arbitrary and capricious. On the contrary, they are conducted an made in accordance with the applicable laws at the time. Your request is for applications and licenses granted from October 1, 2017 to October 8, 2020 for authorization to engage in transactions related to petroleum, gas or petroleum products of Syrian origin. As we indicated in our acknowledgement letter to you, dated October 22, 2020, this requires us to process the records through the Treasury submitter notice process found at 31 C.F.R.\u00a71.5.\r\n\r\nUpon the completion of that process and in accordance with 5 U.S.C.\u00a7552(a)(8)(A) we withhold information under this section only if;\r\n\r\n(I) the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b)[5 U.S.C\u00a7552]; or\r\n(II) disclosure is prohibited by law.\r\n\r\nOFAC followed this same process when we processed Mr. Kopplin\u2019s request and released to him those records and information that were not exempt from release under the FOIA. We withheld only that information and records that was exemption under the FOIA. We therefore cannot now disclose more information to you because properly and legally redacted records do not suit your purpose.\r\n\r\nAs we also indicated to you in our October 22, 2020 letter, we generally process our cases on a first-in, first-out basis. There are currently 275 cases ahead of your request in our queue. Because of the deleterious effects of Covid-19 our processing time has been negatively affected. We cannot at this time provide you with a date certain when we can provide you with a further response to your request. But we will work as diligently as we can to get to your request.\r\n\r\nSince the records have been processed and they are also responsive to your request we will provide your with the records that we sent to Mr. Kopplin in FOIA case 2020-06-162. Please consider this as a first interim response to your request.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that OFAC has conducted a search of its records and found 134 pages of responsive material. Of these 134 pages, 98 pages are being withheld in full pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(4) and (b)(6). We are releasing 16 pages of records with redactions made. in part, pursuant to exemptions (b)(4) and (b)(6) of the FOIA, with the remaining 20 pages being released in full.\r\n\r\nFOIA exemption (b)(4) protects from disclosure \u201ctrade secrets and commercial and financial information obtained from a person, including companies, [that is] privileged or confidential.\u201d The recent Supreme Court decision in Food Marketing held that information is confidential within the meaning of exemption (b)(4) when it is customarily and actually treated as private by its owner. In other words, the information is not customarily disseminated to the public. See Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U.S. (2019). OFAC used this exemption to withhold confidential business information.\r\n\r\nFOIA exemption (b)(6) protects from disclosure personal privacy information, the release of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

(See what some international law experts are saying on this issue https://newrepublic.com/article/158841/pompeo-trump-steal-oil-kurds-syria-iraq). It is therefore necessary to understand in details who are the Syrian signatories of the deal with Delta Crescent. \r\n\r\nPart of the export plans discussed by Delta Crescent Energy in the Kurdistan Regional Government seem to imply the use of pipelines jointly owned by Turkey and Iraq without consulting all the concerned parties. Major international legal issues could arise from this oil deal. This is one of the reasons why we pursue a full disclosure of the export route, business entities mentioned in the OFAC licence.\r\n\r\nNot without mentioning all the middlemen, smugglers who reap profits from the Syrian oil business in a war economy. The public needs to know whether Delta Crescent Energy is engaging with certain entities in both Syria and KRG. Releasing more details of the OFAC licence would definitely serve this purpose. \r\n\r\nWe also request full disclosure of the OFAC licence applications submitted by Moti Kahana and Mashriq Analytics and Consulting Llc, and of the documents related to any other applicant and issued between October 1, 2017 and May 6, 2021. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your cooperation.",

        "communication": "Dear all,\r\n\r\nOn August 11 we received the following letter explaining why our appeal had been turned down (see below for public records). Although our request to know more about the activities of Delta Crescent LLC in Syria was rejected on \"privacy\" grounds, we reiterate our interest in obtaining all OFAC records related to other applicants, as expressed in our initial request. If possible, we would also like to update our request to include applications submitted until today, 9 September 2021. Thanks for your cooperation. \r\n\r\n \r\n   August 11, 2021  FOIA No.:  2021-FOIA-00017 OASIS No.:  1149705  Roberta Pasini SyriaUntold DEPT MR 103307 411A Highland Ave. Somerville, MA 02144 \r\n\r\n     \r\nRE:  FOIA Appeal No. 2021-FOIA-00017A \r\n Dear Ms. Pasini:   This responds to your Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d) appeal dated June 1, 2021 and \r\nreceived July 14, 2021 of the Office of Foreign Assets Control\u2019s (\u201cOFAC\u201d or \u201cAgency\u201d) \r\nFebruary 4, 2021 first interim response to your March 19, 2021 FOIA request (2021-FOIA-\r\n00017) (the \u201cRequest\u201d).  The above-referenced request was made on behalf SyriaUntold.  The FOIA requires that where information is deleted from a record pursuant to an exemption, the \r\nexemption under which the deletion is made shall be indicated on the released portion of the \r\nrecord, unless indicating the exemption would harm an interest protected by the exemption.1  As \r\nrelevant here, OFAC\u2019s first interim response to the Request included documents with \r\ninformation redacted or withheld pursuant to FOIA Exemptions (b)(4) and (b)(6).  Although you \r\ndo not identify the grounds on which the appeal rests \u2014 and although OFAC\u2019s processing of \r\nyour request remains ongoing \u2014 your submission appears to challenge OFAC\u2019s assertion of \r\nthese exemptions in the files provided as part of OFAC\u2019s first interim response to the Request.  Exemption (b)(4) protects \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from \r\na person [that is] privileged or confidential.\u201d2  For purposes of this exemption, courts treat \r\ninformation as \u201cconfidential\u201d when the information is \u201ccustomarily kept private, or at least \r\nclosely held\u201d by the submitter.\u201d3  Courts also consider whether the government has provided \r\n\u201csome assurance\u201d that the information will not be disclosed.4  I conclude that OFAC properly asserted Exemption (b)(4) in this instance.  Your appeal argues \r\nthat OFAC should have revealed \u201cmore details\u201d about Delta Crescent Energy, LLC\u2019s license \r\napplication so it could identify the Syrian signatories to the transaction at issue in the application.  \r\nThis argument does not address the propriety of OFAC\u2019s assertion of Exemption (b)(4), i.e., the \r\nsensitivity and privacy of information withheld or redacted in OFAC\u2019s first interim response.   1 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). 2 Id. \u00a7 552(b)(4). 3 Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, 139 S. Ct. 2356, 2363 (2019). 4 Id. \r\nIrrespective of this deficiency, a careful review of OFAC\u2019s first interim response reveals that the \r\ninformation withheld or redacted pursuant to Exemption (b)(4) relates to commercial or financial \r\ninformation about Delta Crescent Energy, LLC and its parent companies that is sensitive and/or \r\nconfidential in nature.    Therefore, I deny your appeal to the extent it challenges OFAC\u2019s Exemption (b)(4) assertions \r\nover portions of the Agency\u2019s first interim response.  Exemption (b)(6) protects information about individuals in \u201cpersonnel and medical files and \r\nsimilar files\u201d when the disclosure of such information \u201cwould constitute a clearly unwarranted \r\ninvasion of personal privacy.\u201d5  In assessing agencies\u2019 assertions of Exemption (b)(6), courts \r\nhave held that an agency should: (1) determine whether the information at issue is a personnel, \r\nmedical or \u201csimilar\u201d file; (2) determine whether a personal privacy interest is involved; \r\n(3) determine whether a public interest in disclosure is involved and qualifies for consideration; \r\nand (4) balance the personal privacy interest against any qualifying public interest.6  I conclude that OFAC properly asserted Exemption (b)(6) in this instance.  Your arguments \r\nrelate exclusively to the third prong of this analysis, i.e., that OFAC should release \u201cmore \r\ndetails\u201d about Delta Crescent Energy, LLC\u2019s license \u2014 namely, the \u201cSyrian signatories to the \r\ndeal with Delta Crescent\u201d \u2014 because \u201cthe public needs to know\u201d whether these engagements \r\n\u201cviolat[e] international law.\u201d  But your appeal neither discusses the personal privacy interest \r\nimplicated by the potential release this information nor balances these personal privacy interests \r\nagainst the claimed public interest.    Even so, I conclude that OFAC\u2019s assertion of Exemption (b)(6) satisfies each step of the required \r\nanalysis.  A careful review of the records produced to SyriaUntold shows that OFAC asserted \r\nExemption (b)(6) over information relating to names, signatures, addresses, birth dates, \r\ngovernment identification numbers, telephone numbers, and email addresses of Delta Crescent \r\nEnergy, LLC\u2019s employees and business partners.  This information implicates a \u201csubstantial\u201d \r\nprivacy interest under FOIA that is not outweighed by the public interest concerns you allude to \r\nin the appeal.7  Therefore, I deny your appeal to the extent it challenges OFAC\u2019s Exemption (b)(6) assertions \r\nover portions of the Agency\u2019s first interim response.  Judicial review of my decision is available in the district court of the United States in the district \r\nin which you reside or have a principal place of business, in which the agency records are \r\nsituated, or in the District of Columbia, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).

As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience.

Govt. Code section 6250, et seq., hereinafter the \u201cCPRA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u201c\u2026Records regarding the potential for violence, unrest, criminal activities or other disturbances associated with protests or other activities on either January 5 or January 6, 2021 at local, regional or national events. This request includes but is not limited to inter-departmental communications, situational reports, bulletins and other documents.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 6254(b); 6254(c); 6254(f); 6254(k); and 6255.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, the Department is in the process of identifying records responsive to your request. We will provide you with a response upon completion of our search.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requester,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience. We have completed our review of your request to the Los Angeles Police Department (\u201cLAPD\u201d or \u201cDepartment\u201d) under the California Public Records Act (Cal. Govt. Code section 6250, et seq., hereinafter the \u201cCPRA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u201c\u2026Records regarding the potential for violence, unrest, criminal activities or other disturbances associated with protests or other activities on either January 5 or January 6, 2021 at local, regional or national events. This request includes but is not limited to inter-departmental communications, situational reports, bulletins and other documents.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department has conducted a search and identified records responsive to your request. Pursuant to the Government Code Sections 6254(K) and 6255, responsive records are provided to you with redactions. Section 6254(k) exempts records which are exempt from disclosure under federal or state law, including but not limited to provisions of the Evidence Code relating to privilege. Evidence Code Section 1040 declares an official information privilege for information acquired in confidence by a public agency when the public interest in disclosing the information is outweighed by the public interest in keeping the information confidential. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6255 exempts from disclosure records and information when \u201cthe public interest served by not disclosing the record and/or information, clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.\u201d\u00a0The Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the analysis and evaluation of the techniques, procedures, tactics and security used by the Department. Disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to endanger the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public in the event of a similar law enforcement initiative in a future occurrence. Furthermore, additional redactions have been applied in accordance with the California Government Code, Section 6254(f), which exempts from disclosure records of investigations conducted by, or investigatory files compiled by, any local police agency for law enforcement purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you again for your patience.\u00a0If you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

This request includes but is not limited to inter-departmental communications, situational reports, bulletins and other documents.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nThis request is filed by Kent Hoover, a citizen of Memphis, in coordination with Emma North-Best.",

If you do NOT have a reference number that usually begins with a \u201cW\u201d, then your request has not been successfully created in our portal and you would need to submit a request if you would like for the City to provide you with public records.\r\n\r\nAgain please provide a reference number and you may contact our office at 901-636-6511 if you should need further assistance,\r\nSincerely,\r\nPublic records office",

This request includes but is not limited to inter-departmental communications, situational reports, bulletins and other documents.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such.

As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience.

Your request mentioned \u201cTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Tennessee Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nRecords regarding the potential for violence, unrest, criminal activities or other disturbances associated with protests or other activities on either January 5 or January 6, 2021 at local, regional or national events. This request includes but is not limited to inter-departmental communications, situational reports, bulletins and other documents. \r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. \r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

We received your request on May 16, 2017\r\nand assigned it case number DODOIG-2017-000595.\r\n\r\n\tThe Evaluations component conducted a search and located records\r\nresponsive to your request.  In coordination with U.S. Special Operations\r\nCommand (USSOCOM) and the Office of Secretary of Defense/Joint Staff, we\r\ndetermined that the attached report, totaling 144 pages, is appropriate for\r\nrelease in part pursuant to the following FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) exemptions: \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(1), which pertains to information that is currently and properly\r\nclassified pursuant to Executive Order 13526, sections: \r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(a), military plans, weapon systems, or operations; \r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(d), foreign relations or foreign activities of the\r\nUnited States, including confidential sources;\r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(g), vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems,\r\ninstallations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services\r\nrelating to the national security; and\r\n\r\n\to\t1.7(e), compilations of items of information that are\r\nindividually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information\r\nreveals an additional association or relationship that: (1) meets the\r\nstandards for classification under this order; and (2) is not otherwise\r\nrevealed in the individual items of information. \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(3), which pertains to information exempted from release by\r\nstatute, in this instance, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130(b) \u0096 Personally identifiable\r\ninformation pertaining to members of the armed forces assigned to \"routinely\r\ndeployable unit[s]\" and certain employees of DOD and DHS. \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(5), which protects privileged communications within or between\r\nagencies, including those protected by the deliberative process privilege.\r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(6), which pertains to information, the release of which would\r\nconstitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. \r\n\r\nOur review included consideration of the foreseeable harm standard, as\r\nstated in DoDM 5400.07.  Under this standard, the content of a particular\r\nrecord should be reviewed and a determination made as to whether the DoD\r\nComponent reasonably foresees that disclosing it, given its age, content,\r\nand character, would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this an adverse determination, you may submit an appeal.\r\nYour appeal, if any, must be postmarked within 90 days of the date of this\r\nletter, clearly identify the determination that you would like to appeal,\r\nand reference to the FOIA case number above.
