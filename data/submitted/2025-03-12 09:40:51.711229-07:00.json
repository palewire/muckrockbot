The dual role of Elon Musk as both owner of X Corp and a special government advisor creates an inherent potential conflict of interest that the public has an urgent need to understand, particularly if federal advertising expenditures are being redirected to benefit X Corp.\r\nMatter of Widespread Public Interest: The relationship between Elon Musk and the federal government, including his advisory role and any corresponding benefits to his business interests, has received substantial national media coverage and public interest. Major news outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN, and others have reported on these matters, indicating significant public concern.\r\nTime-Sensitive Nature: These records pertain to ongoing government activities and expenditures, with potential continuing effects on federal advertising decisions and budget allocations. Delay in disclosure would significantly reduce the value of the information to inform the public about current government activities.\r\nCredible Public Interest Journalism: As an established investigative journalist, I have a demonstrated track record of analyzing and disseminating information about government operations to a broad public audience. The requested information will be promptly analyzed and shared through established news media channels.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1303.70 (OMB), and 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 105-60.305-13 (GSA), I request a complete waiver of all search, review, and duplication fees associated with this request based on the following grounds:\r\n\r\nDisclosure Will Significantly Contribute to Public Understanding: The requested records will reveal previously undisclosed information about federal expenditures, potential conflicts of interest, and policy decisions regarding social media advertising that are not currently available to the general public. Specifically:\r\na) The requested records concern identified operations and activities of the federal government, namely the expenditure of taxpayer funds on advertising with X Corp and the potential influence of Elon Musk's advisory role on these decisions.\r\nb) Disclosure will be meaningfully informative and will enhance public understanding of government operations, as it will reveal the extent, nature, and timing of federal advertising expenditures with X Corp and any correlation with Musk's advisory role.\r\nc) The contribution to public understanding will be significant, as these records will allow for the first comprehensive analysis of federal advertising expenditures with X Corp following Musk's appointment as a government advisor.\r\nDisclosure Will Not Primarily Serve Commercial Interest: The primary purpose of this request is to inform the public about federal activities and expenditures:\r\na) As an investigative journalist, I will analyze these records and disseminate the information to the public through established news media channels, reaching a broad audience.\r\nb) Any commercial benefit that might accrue is incidental to the public purpose of informing citizens about government operations and expenditures.\r\nc) The public interest in disclosure far outweighs any commercial interest, as it concerns the potential conflicts of interest in the federal government's advertising decisions and expenditure of taxpayer funds.\r\n\r\nShould the fee waiver be denied, please notify me before incurring costs exceeding $100. I reserve the right to appeal any denial of the fee waiver request.\r\nFORMAT OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records in their native electronic format with all metadata intact. Specifically:\r\n\r\nElectronic Communications:\r\n\r\nEmails should be provided in .MSG or .EML format to preserve header information\r\nText messages or instant messages in their native format with metadata preserved\r\nCalendar items in .ICS format with attendee and scheduling information intact\r\n\r\n\r\nDocuments:\r\n\r\nWord processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in their native formats (.DOCX, .XLSX, .PPTX)\r\nIf converted to PDF, documents should be text-searchable and maintain metadata\r\nDatabase extracts in structured formats (.CSV, .XML, .JSON) with field descriptions\r\n\r\n\r\nContract and Financial Records:\r\n\r\nContracts in their complete form with all attachments\r\nFinancial data in machine-readable formats that maintain calculation formulas and relationships\r\nAnalytics reports in their original format with all charts, tables, and underlying data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION REQUEST AND RIGHT TO APPEAL\r\n\r\nI request that all responsive records be preserved in their entirety, including metadata, pending the processing of this request. If you determine that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that:\r\n\r\nYou provide a detailed Vaughn index specifically identifying each document withheld, the statutory exemption claimed, and a particularized explanation of how disclosure would damage the interests protected by the claimed exemption.\r\nYou release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of otherwise exempt records, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\nFor each withholding decision, you articulate in writing the specific \"foreseeable harm\" that would result from disclosure, as required by the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016.\r\n\r\nI expressly reserve the right to appeal any full or partial denial of this request, including any determinations regarding the applicability of exemptions, fee waiver denials, expedited processing denials, or regarding the adequacy of the search conducted. Further, I reserve the right to seek judicial review in federal court pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) if your agency fails to comply with FOIA's requirements.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request. As provided by statute, I anticipate a determination on expedited processing within 10 calendar days and a substantive response to this request within 20 working days. Please provide acknowledgment of receipt and a tracking number for this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nInvestigative Journalist\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nDetailed Fee Waiver Justification",

The dual role of Elon Musk as both owner of X Corp and a special government advisor creates an inherent potential conflict of interest that the public has an urgent need to understand, particularly if federal advertising expenditures are being redirected to benefit X Corp.\r\nMatter of Widespread Public Interest: The relationship between Elon Musk and the federal government, including his advisory role and any corresponding benefits to his business interests, has received substantial national media coverage and public interest. Major news outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN, and others have reported on these matters, indicating significant public concern.\r\nTime-Sensitive Nature: These records pertain to ongoing government activities and expenditures, with potential continuing effects on federal advertising decisions and budget allocations. Delay in disclosure would significantly reduce the value of the information to inform the public about current government activities.\r\nCredible Public Interest Journalism: As an established investigative journalist, I have a demonstrated track record of analyzing and disseminating information about government operations to a broad public audience. The requested information will be promptly analyzed and shared through established news media channels.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1303.70 (OMB), and 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 105-60.305-13 (GSA), I request a complete waiver of all search, review, and duplication fees associated with this request based on the following grounds:\r\n\r\nDisclosure Will Significantly Contribute to Public Understanding: The requested records will reveal previously undisclosed information about federal expenditures, potential conflicts of interest, and policy decisions regarding social media advertising that are not currently available to the general public. Specifically:\r\na) The requested records concern identified operations and activities of the federal government, namely the expenditure of taxpayer funds on advertising with X Corp and the potential influence of Elon Musk's advisory role on these decisions.\r\nb) Disclosure will be meaningfully informative and will enhance public understanding of government operations, as it will reveal the extent, nature, and timing of federal advertising expenditures with X Corp and any correlation with Musk's advisory role.\r\nc) The contribution to public understanding will be significant, as these records will allow for the first comprehensive analysis of federal advertising expenditures with X Corp following Musk's appointment as a government advisor.\r\nDisclosure Will Not Primarily Serve Commercial Interest: The primary purpose of this request is to inform the public about federal activities and expenditures:\r\na) As an investigative journalist, I will analyze these records and disseminate the information to the public through established news media channels, reaching a broad audience.\r\nb) Any commercial benefit that might accrue is incidental to the public purpose of informing citizens about government operations and expenditures.\r\nc) The public interest in disclosure far outweighs any commercial interest, as it concerns the potential conflicts of interest in the federal government's advertising decisions and expenditure of taxpayer funds.\r\n\r\nShould the fee waiver be denied, please notify me before incurring costs exceeding $100. I reserve the right to appeal any denial of the fee waiver request.\r\nFORMAT OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records in their native electronic format with all metadata intact. Specifically:\r\n\r\nElectronic Communications:\r\n\r\nEmails should be provided in .MSG or .EML format to preserve header information\r\nText messages or instant messages in their native format with metadata preserved\r\nCalendar items in .ICS format with attendee and scheduling information intact\r\n\r\n\r\nDocuments:\r\n\r\nWord processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in their native formats (.DOCX, .XLSX, .PPTX)\r\nIf converted to PDF, documents should be text-searchable and maintain metadata\r\nDatabase extracts in structured formats (.CSV, .XML, .JSON) with field descriptions\r\n\r\n\r\nContract and Financial Records:\r\n\r\nContracts in their complete form with all attachments\r\nFinancial data in machine-readable formats that maintain calculation formulas and relationships\r\nAnalytics reports in their original format with all charts, tables, and underlying data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION REQUEST AND RIGHT TO APPEAL\r\n\r\nI request that all responsive records be preserved in their entirety, including metadata, pending the processing of this request. If you determine that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that:\r\n\r\nYou provide a detailed Vaughn index specifically identifying each document withheld, the statutory exemption claimed, and a particularized explanation of how disclosure would damage the interests protected by the claimed exemption.\r\nYou release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of otherwise exempt records, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\nFor each withholding decision, you articulate in writing the specific \"foreseeable harm\" that would result from disclosure, as required by the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016.\r\n\r\nI expressly reserve the right to appeal any full or partial denial of this request, including any determinations regarding the applicability of exemptions, fee waiver denials, expedited processing denials, or regarding the adequacy of the search conducted. Further, I reserve the right to seek judicial review in federal court pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) if your agency fails to comply with FOIA's requirements.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request. As provided by statute, I anticipate a determination on expedited processing within 10 calendar days and a substantive response to this request within 20 working days. Please provide acknowledgment of receipt and a tracking number for this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nInvestigative Journalist\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nDetailed Fee Waiver Justification",

The FOIA establishes a strong statutory presumption in favor of disclosure, placing the burden on the agency to justify withholding requested information. This presumption has been consistently recognized and enforced by federal courts. In support of this request, I reference the following authoritative case law and statutory provisions:\r\n\r\n1. **Department of the Air Force v. Rose**, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976): Establishing that FOIA mandates a \"general philosophy of full agency disclosure\" and that exemptions must be \"narrowly construed.\"\r\n\r\n2. **NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co.**, 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978): Reinforcing that FOIA's \"basic purpose reflected 'a general philosophy of full agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language.'\"\r\n\r\n3. **FBI v. Abramson**, 456 U.S. 615, 630 (1982): Affirming that \"FOIA exceptions are to be narrowly construed.\"\r\n\r\n4. **United States Department of Justice v. Julian**, 486 U.S. 1, 8 (1988): Holding that the FOIA's \"mandate of disclosure\" requires federal agencies to disclose records unless they are specifically exempted.\r\n\r\n5. **Public Citizen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice**, 491 U.S. 440, 449 (1989): Emphasizing the public's right to access government records to ensure governmental accountability.\r\n\r\n6. **U.S. Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts**, 492 U.S. 136, 151 (1989): Confirming that agency financial records fall within FOIA's disclosure mandate and supporting the principle that FOIA requests need not demonstrate a \"need to know.\"\r\n\r\n7. **Milner v. Department of the Navy**, 562 U.S. 562, 565 (2011): Reiterating that FOIA \"requires federal agencies to make Government records available to the public, subject to nine exemptions for specific categories of material.\"\r\n\r\n8. **ACLU v. Department of Defense**, 543 F.3d 59, 66 (2d Cir. 2008): Holding that \"FOIA was enacted to promote honest and open government and to assure the existence of an informed citizenry in order to hold the governors accountable to the governed.\"\r\n\r\n9. **Multi Ag Media LLC v. Department of Agriculture**, 515 F.3d 1224, 1232 (D.C. Cir. 2008): Finding that disclosure of financial information in government possession serves FOIA's purpose of permitting public scrutiny of agency action.\r\n\r\n10. **Bloomberg L.P. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System**, 601 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 2010): Compelling disclosure of central bank financial records, establishing precedent for disclosure of government financial holdings.\r\n\r\n11. **American Civil Liberties Union v. Department of Homeland Security**, 627 F.3d 227, 243 (D.C. Cir. 2010): Reiterating that the presumption of openness applies even when the records relate to government operations affecting public accountability.\r\n\r\n12. **Electronic Privacy Information Center v. Department of Justice**, 416 F. Supp. 2d 30, 37 (D.D.C. 2006): Holding that \"FOIA's purpose is to ensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic society.\"\r\n\r\n13. **National Archives and Records Admin. v. Favish**, 541 U.S. 157, 171-172 (2004): Reaffirming that FOIA's central purpose is to ensure that government activities are \"opened to the sharp eye of public scrutiny.\"\r\n\r\n14. **Cause of Action v. Federal Trade Commission**, 799 F.3d 1108, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 2015): Emphasizing that FOIA's goal is \"to pierce the veil of administrative secrecy and to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.\"\r\n\r\n15. **Competitive Enterprise Institute v. Office of Science & Technology Policy**, 827 F.3d 145, 150 (D.C. Cir. 2016): Holding that records relating to government business are subject to FOIA regardless of where they are stored.\r\n\r\n16. **Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Secret Service**, 726 F.3d 208, 216 (D.C. Cir. 2013): Defining agency records broadly to include materials that an agency has created, obtained, or controlled.\r\n\r\n17. **EPIC v. DHS**, 999 F.3d 669, 675 (D.C. Cir. 2021): Reinforcing that the burden is on the agency to prove that requested documents fall within a FOIA exemption, not on the requester to prove they do not.\r\n\r\n18. **Center for Investigative Reporting v. U.S. Department of Justice**, 982 F.3d 668 (9th Cir. 2020): Limiting the application of Exemption 7(A) for law enforcement records, particularly when related to completed enforcement actions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this extensive case law, I note that the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (Public Law No. 114-185) further strengthens the presumption of openness by codifying the \"foreseeable harm\" standard, requiring agencies to withhold information only if \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\" or \"disclosure is prohibited by law.\" This statutory requirement places an additional burden on the agency to justify any withholding of the requested records.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the OPEN Government Act of 2007 (Public Law No. 110-175) emphasizes timely responses to FOIA requests and mandates greater agency accountability in FOIA processing.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and Treasury FOIA regulations at 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.7(k), I request a waiver of all search, review, and duplication fees associated with this request based on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n1. **Public Interest Criterion:** Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it will significantly contribute to public understanding of government operations and activities, specifically:\r\n\r\n   a) The requested records concern the operations and activities of the federal government in managing significant financial assets in the form of cryptocurrencies;\r\n\r\n   b) Disclosure will significantly enhance the public's understanding of how the Treasury Department manages digital assets, particularly in light of Executive Order 14178 establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve;\r\n\r\n   c) The records will reveal how public funds and seized assets are being handled, providing transparency into an area of government activity that has received minimal public disclosure to date;\r\n\r\n   d) These records will contribute to the public's understanding of the implementation of a significant new government initiative that potentially impacts U.S. financial and monetary policy.\r\n\r\n2. **News Media Dissemination:** As an investigative journalist, I will use these records to analyze and report on the Treasury Department's cryptocurrency activities through established news media channels, reaching a broad audience and enhancing public understanding of this government function.\r\n\r\n3. **Not Primarily Commercial Interest:** The primary purpose of this request is journalistic and in the public interest, not for commercial benefit. Any commercial benefit that might accrue is incidental to the public purpose of informing citizens about government activities.\r\n\r\nShould you deny this fee waiver request, please notify me before incurring any costs exceeding $100. In such case, I reserve the right to appeal the denial of the fee waiver and/or modify the scope of the request to reduce applicable fees.\r\n\r\n EXPEDITED PROCESSING REQUEST:\r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) and 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.5(e), I request expedited processing of this FOIA request due to:\r\n\r\n1. An urgency to inform the public about federal government activity that involves questions about the government's integrity, particularly regarding the implementation of Executive Order 14178 and the establishment of cryptocurrency reserves using public funds;\r\n\r\n2. The matter is of widespread and exceptional media interest, with significant questions about the government's financial management practices that affect public confidence.\r\n\r\nFORMAT OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records in their native electronic format with all metadata intact. Specifically:\r\n\r\n1. **Emails and Electronic Communications:**\r\n   - Provide in .MSG, .EML, or similar format that preserves all header information\r\n   - Include all attachments as separate files in their native formats\r\n   - Preserve complete metadata including routing information, timestamps, and delivery information\r\n   - Maintain threading and conversation indices\r\n   - Include server logs associated with transmission and receipt where available\r\n\r\n2. **Structured Data:**\r\n   - Provide databases in their native format or as complete exports (SQL dumps, CSV, JSON, or XML)\r\n   - Include data dictionaries, schema documentation, and relationship diagrams\r\n   - Preserve all field names, table structures, and relationship information\r\n\r\n3. **Documents and Reports:**\r\n   - Provide in native format (e.g., .DOCX, .XLSX, .PPTX) rather than as images\r\n   - If converted to PDF, ensure they are text-searchable and maintain metadata\r\n   - Preserve version history information where available\r\n\r\n4. **Blockchain Data:**\r\n   - Provide wallet addresses and transaction hashes in machine-readable format\r\n   - Include blockchain explorer exports where available\r\n   - Maintain cryptographic integrity of any provided signatures or keys\r\n\r\n5. **Calendar Items and Meeting Records:**\r\n   - Provide in .ICS or similar format that preserves attendee information and recurrence data\r\n   - Include meeting minutes as separate attachments in native format\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive preservation of metadata is essential to understanding the context, authenticity, and complete nature of the records being sought.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF RECORDS AND RIGHT TO APPEAL:\r\n\r\nI request that all responsive records be preserved intact and without redaction pending the processing of this request. If you determine that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that:\r\n\r\n1. You provide a detailed Vaughn index specifically identifying each document withheld, the statutory exemption claimed, and a particularized explanation of how disclosure would damage the interests protected by the claimed exemption;\r\n\r\n2. You release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of documents containing redacted material, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b);\r\n\r\n3. For each withholding decision, you articulate in writing the specific \"foreseeable harm\" that would result from disclosure, as required by the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016.\r\n\r\nI expressly reserve the right to appeal any full or partial denial of this request, including any determinations regarding the applicability of exemptions, fee waiver denials, expedited processing denials, or regarding the adequacy of the search conducted. Further, I reserve the right to seek judicial review in federal court pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) if the Department fails to comply with FOIA's requirements.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request. As provided by statute, I anticipate a determination on this request within 20 working days, unless expedited processing is granted, in which case a response is expected within 10 calendar days. Please provide a tracking number for this request \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nInvestigative Journalist",

The letter is referenced in this press release: https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-sends-letters-60-universities-under-investigation-antisemitic-discrimination-and-harassment. Under the Wisconsin Public Records Laws, records custodians must carefully weigh the competing public interests involved when deciding to release any record in their possession.\u00a0 Custodians begin with a presumption of complete public access to such records.\u00a0 However, custodians must consider whether inspection of the record could result in harm to the public interest that would outweigh the benefits of such inspection.\u00a0 When such harm substantially outweighs the benefits of public inspection, such records or portions thereof, must remain confidential. I have interpreted your request to be for a letter received by UW Madison on March 10 th from the U.S. Department of Education. Your request for the U.S. Department of Education letter is denied at this time as the letter warns of potential enforcement action and that action is ongoing. You may request these records at a later date. Please reach out if you have any questions. Ongoing investigation materials: Ongoing investigations are by definition a work in progress. Since the potential enforcement action is ongoing in this instance, when balancing the public\u2019s interest in the release of these records with the interests of the university and the U.S. Department of Education, I am making the determination that the public interest in withholding these records is greater than the public interest in release. The public has an interest in the effective enforcement action by the Office for Civil Rights under Title VI. The premature release of records related to such a potential enforcement could impede the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s thorough investigation, and therefore, impact the rights of both the agency and the university. It is in the public\u2019s interest to allow the university to respond to this letter and to allow the U.S. Department of Education to conduct its investigation without interruption or prejudice following the established federal process for Title VI complaints. As stated above, you may request this record at a later date, but this request is denied at this time and closed. The university is required to inform you that to the extent this amounts to a denial of your request it is subject to review by mandamus under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1)(a) or by application to the attorney general or district attorney pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1)(b). The university has responded to your request and it is now closed. Sincerely, Julie Laundrie Public Records Custodian Office of Compliance University of Wisconsin-Madison   \n  \n \n \n \n Access the Public Records Center to View the Request\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Vermont Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI respectfully request records held by the Vermont Department of State\u2019s Attorneys and Sheriffs concerning the investigation and its resolution involving a property in Stamford, Vermont, as chronicled in the Rolling Stone article titled \"The Ezra Miller Saga Now Involves Vermont\u2019s Child Services Department\" (published August 10, 2022, available at: https://web.archive.org/web/20241215093133/https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/ezra-miller-vermont-child-services-department-1392572/).\r\n\r\nThe article details attempts by Vermont State Police to serve an emergency care order on August 6, 7, and 9, 2022, at Ezra Miller\u2019s 96-acre farm in Stamford, intended to remove a 25-year-old mother and her three children amid supposed welfare concerns, with oversight by the Vermont Department for Children and Families (DCF) and involvement of state\u2019s attorney(s) in legal proceedings or service efforts. \r\nMost notably, the article includes information or statements attributed to the State Attorney\u2019s Office suggesting the property owner was attempting to \"evade\" the order or \"shield\" someone (quote: \"the Vermont State Attorney\u2019s office said seemed like an attempt to \u201cevade service\u201d of the order, according to the court document obtained by Rolling Stone.\")\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I seek the following from August 1, 2022, through December 31, 2023:\r\n\r\n- All documents related to the emergency care order & its investigation & service, including reports, logs, court documents, affidavits, field notes,  incident reports, warrants, summonses, etc from the Department of State\u2019s Attorneys and Sheriffs coordinating or documenting attempts from Vermont State Police to serve it on August 6, 7, and 9, 2022, or any later efforts, concerning the mother and her children\u2019s welfare. This includes records of challenges (e.g., access issues or alleged evasion) and outcomes (e.g., successful service, withdrawal, alternative resolutions, etc), as well as any internal reviews or supervisory notes regarding the handling of the case.\r\n\r\n- Correspondence (e.g., emails, memos, letters, texts, call logs, etc) between the Department of State\u2019s Attorneys and Sheriffs, Vermont State Police, Vermont DCF, or other judicial personnel regarding this emergency care order, its investigation, its execution, or its resolution, as well as legal filings, opinions, or court documents prepared by state\u2019s attorneys\u2014such as the order\u2019s application, welfare concern justifications, or filings for the hearing(s) referenced in the article\u2014including any records reflecting the \"evasion\" or \"shielding\" claim and/or an apparent pending hearing referenced in the Rolling Stone article scheduled on or after August 10, 2022 (quote: \"A hearing is scheduled for the matter later this week.\"), along with any drafts, amendments, or annotations to these legal documents.\r\n\r\n- Documentation of inter-agency coordination with Vermont State Police, Vermont DCF, or other entities (including out-of-state agencies) about the welfare of the mother and children or the order\u2019s execution, including meeting notes, disposition records, situation reports, inter-agency referrals, or child welfare assessments (e.g., risk or safety evaluations)\u2014and if any responsive records are held by other agencies (including out-of-state), I request disclosure to ensure all relevant documents are obtained, including any chain-of-custody records for evidence or information shared between agencies.\r\n\r\nI request that any exempt personal information (e.g., names of minors or private individuals) be redacted rather than withholding any documents entirely, consistent with the Vermont Public Records Act\u2019s presumption of disclosure (1 V.S.A. \u00a7 315 et seq.).\r\nI am not affiliated with any news agencies & this request is not being made for commercial purposes. This inquiry serves the public interest by shedding light on the resolution of a widely publicized matter (yet for some reason never followed up on by news organizations) involving child welfare and inter-agency action, fostering transparency in governmental proceedings, and discouraging vigilante justice from members of the public who, due to rampant disinformation by omission, might be inclined to take matters into their own hands against a perceived child abductor.\r\nIf there are any issues with the scope or specificity of this request, please contact me to discuss it before denying or delaying the response.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPJ",
