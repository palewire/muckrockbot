See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddr_NOVIELLOJohnny.pdf. \r\n\r\nThis request includes, but is not limited to, the following records: \r\n\r\n1. Any Mortality Review  and associated working papers conducted by ICE Health Services Corps or the Bureau of Prisons\r\n2. Any Death Review conducted by ICE ERAU or BOP\r\n3. Any Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis or similar document created by Creative Corrections or another Contractor\r\n4. All extant video showing Mr. Noviello in ICE or BOP custody.\r\n5. All BOP and/or ICE medical records for Mr. Noviello. \r\n6. Any Executive Summary or Findings information regarding Mr. Noviello's death\r\n7. Any autopsy report for Mr. Noviello, complete with toxicology. \r\n8. Records of any contract discrepancy reports or similar findings.\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e) and declare under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the news media investigating and reporting edited pieces on deaths in ICE custody and abuses of power by federal law enforcement agencies. See, e.g., https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/. \r\n2. Mr. Noviello is the first ICE detainee to die in a BOP facility in over a decade. \r\n3. His death in BOP's FDC Miami following his imprisonment at Krome Service Processing Center has been the subject of widespread media coverage about which serious questions exist as to the care the government provided him. \r\n4. ICE's Miami Field Office has overseen the custody and care of at least six (6) people, including Mr. Noviello, who died in ICE custody in FY25--the most of any field office in the United States.\r\n5. An urgent need exists for the public to obtain, review, and understand the circumstances surrounding Mr. Noviello's death in custody as ICE deaths continue to rise to their highest levels since the Covid pandemic and the agency is poised to massively expand ICE detention capacity.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddr_NOVIELLOJohnny.pdf. \r\n\r\nThis request includes, but is not limited to, the following records: \r\n\r\n1. Any Mortality Review  and associated working papers conducted by ICE Health Services Corps or the Bureau of Prisons\r\n2. Any Death Review conducted by ICE ERAU or BOP\r\n3. Any Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis or similar document created by Creative Corrections or another Contractor\r\n4. All extant video showing Mr. Noviello in ICE or BOP custody.\r\n5. All BOP and/or ICE medical records for Mr. Noviello. \r\n6. Any Executive Summary or Findings information regarding Mr. Noviello's death\r\n7. Any autopsy report for Mr. Noviello, complete with toxicology. \r\n8. Records of any contract discrepancy reports or similar findings.\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e) and declare under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the news media investigating and reporting edited pieces on deaths in ICE custody and abuses of power by federal law enforcement agencies. See, e.g., https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/. \r\n2. Mr. Noviello is the first ICE detainee to die in a BOP facility in over a decade. \r\n3. His death in BOP's FDC Miami following his imprisonment at Krome Service Processing Center has been the subject of widespread media coverage about which serious questions exist as to the care the government provided him. \r\n4. ICE's Miami Field Office has overseen the custody and care of at least six (6) people, including Mr. Noviello, who died in ICE custody in FY25--the most of any field office in the United States.\r\n5. An urgent need exists for the public to obtain, review, and understand the circumstances surrounding Mr. Noviello's death in custody as ICE deaths continue to rise to their highest levels since the Covid pandemic and the agency is poised to massively expand ICE detention capacity.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at abauman@openvallejo.org, or by phone at (707) 561-2108.
