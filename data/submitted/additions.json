Purchase records, invoices, procurement documents and other documents sufficient to show any and all disbursement of public funds for the acquisition by your agency since January 1, 2022 of explosives and pyrotechnics, such as \"flash bang\" grenades and explosive breaching tools, and chemical weapons such as \"teargas\" and \"pepper balls\".\r\n\r\n3. Records of deployment by your agency since January 1, 2022 of projectile launch platforms and munitions, such as 40mm projectile launchers, \"bean bag\" or specialty impact munition (\"SIM\") weapons, and \"riot guns\" used to disperse chemical agents; explosives and pyrotechnics, such as \"flashbang\" grenades and explosive breaching tools; and chemical weapons such as \"teargas\" and \"pepper balls\".\r\n\r\n4.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",
