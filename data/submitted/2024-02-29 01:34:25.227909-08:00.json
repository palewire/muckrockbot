(\"CPRA\u201d), and all other applicable laws, please disclose the following records.\r\n\r\nAny and all autopsy, death investigation, and coroner\u2019s reports relating to the deaths of the following individuals:\r\n\r\nName: Joseph Trevino, Date of birth: 09-30-1959, Date of death: 02-04-2005\r\n\r\nName: Alberto Arriaga, Date of birth: 02-23-1965, Date of death: 07-23-2010\r\n\r\nName: Omar Abrego, Date of birth: 12-24-1976, Date of death: 08-03-2014\r\n\r\nIf records pursuant to this request are possessed in machine-readable format such as an .xls, .csv spreadsheet file, please provide the record in this format. Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at sam.levin@theguardian.com or 646-935-9115. \r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSam Levin",

Any opinion issued that mentions or includes the keywords \"partial administration\" or \"partial medication administration\" either as a formal opinion or other formal document specific to Registered Nurses.\r\n2. Any an email sent by the person or person(s) with the authority to opine and clarify nuances and specificity referring specifically to RN scope of practice such as by the DON, ADON, CNO (if an available position at your agency), or a similar high-ranking nursing professional of a different title OR non-nursing professional if such person(s) exist that can issue authoritative opinions on the matter, whichever appropriate person(s) exist within your agency. If specificity is required for this criterion, please refer to the keywords above. I'm aware of the ANA Scope of Practice and it does not opine on partial administrations with any degree of specificity or nuance.  I request emails where such person(s) are either sender, recipient, cc, or bcc, but please exclude baileypillon@gmail dot com as sender and/or recipient in the responsive records unless noted in a response (I apologize in advance) to this email.\r\n3. Regarding (1) and (2), I request to know the specific contexts in which a partial medication administration is permissible, if at all, and if it is specific to the setting, if it is the case. If so, please specify what contexts it is permissible and when nursing judgment and critical thinking reasonably applies when considering the reasonable, prudent legal standard that RNs are held to.\r\n4. The titles of the person(s) that typically work on EMR/EHRs and the percentage of those persons who are medical professionals that hold an active license from 2019-2024, if it is known to our agency. Please breakdown by year, if possible.\r\n5. If there is a differentiation regarding partial administrations (assuming it is within scope at all) between RNs and LPNs and if it varies depending on the setting and/or context within this specific criterion (5).\r\n6. If a partial medication administration is indeed within the scope of practice within RNs, I wish to know in what manner a healthcare facility may limit or entirely restrict partial administrations, if instructed nursing leadership or noted in the facility policies/procedures.\r\n7. The precise policies/procedures taken by your agency in the event that legal action (in the form of a civil or criminal suit specifically by your agency) is taken against a licensed nursing or other medical professional, including the titles of the person(s) involved.\r\n8. Any documents, if it is the case that a rare, one time partial administration is not within the scope of practice for RNs, that state the rationale as to why it is not within scope according to your agency.\r\n9. Any documents or opinions issued by your agency that set forth an opinion, guidelines, or other type of document wherein there is a clinical disagreement between the RN and MD/DO/ARNP/PA regarding an order, according to clinical judgment, if it conflicts between the RN and provider.\r\n10. Any documents wherein a non-nursing medical professional (specifically an MD/DO) can decide (and if it is legal) what is or isn't within the scope of practice for an RN, given that the provider is not an RN.\r\n\r\nIf responsive records for the above criteria exceed 200 records, please provide the number of responsive records by each criterion so that I can narrow the scope and/or time frame of this request. I sincerely appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge and such documents made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I grant permission for fees up to $50. If the fees are still in excess of $50, please let me know as well as the number of results produced and I will further revise the criteria. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your refusal to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days. Please provide an estimated completion date for the above responsive records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBailey Pillon RN",

To reduce processing time, please provide as much detail as possible regarding the specific records you are requesting.
