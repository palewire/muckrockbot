As written, responding to your request would create an undue burden on the operation and resources of the Department.  The Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140/1, states, in part the \"Act is not intended ... to disrupt the duly-undertaken work of any public body...\" and that requests \"calling for all records falling within a category shall be complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for the complying public body and there is no way to narrow the request and the burden on the public body outweighs the public interest in the information.  Before invoking this exemption, the public body shall extend to the person making the request an opportunity to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions.\" 5 ILCS 140/3(g).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I am inviting you to limit the scope of your request to manageable proportions. Specifically, there are nearly 1500 pages of permitting records for the year 2023.  Previewing and redacting this many files creates a burden on the FOIA Office.  Please limit the scope of your request to a specific location or a shorter timeframe to search.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce we receive your response, we will conduct a new search and respond with any relevant requested information.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarb Smith\r\nIllinois Department of Transportation\r\nFOIA Officer, Room 313\r\n2300 S.

Veciana was a founder of the  militant anti-Castro organization Alpha 66. Proof of death is not required as his death was widely reported: https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article243662282.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPaul Galante\n\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nInventory of patrol rifles (as commonly denominated for law enforcement use) and any other assault rifles (as defined in Sections 30510 and 30515 of the California Penal Code) that are owned by the agency, including: Quantity, make, model, and caliber. \r\n\r\nIf your agency does not possess records with an inventory of rifles as defined above, then we request purchase records, invoices, procurement documents and other documents sufficient to show the quantity, make, model and caliber of patrol rifles acquired by your agency since 2007. \r\n\r\nDiscussion: AB 481 required each law enforcement agency in California to post, by May 1st, 2022, inventories and use policies, including quantities, models, and costs, for rifles as defined by Sections 30510 and 30515 of the California Penal Code that the agency owned as of January 1, 2022. In searching your agency\u2019s web site and/or searching the inventory and use policy submitted to the local governing body to comply with AB 481, we were not able to locate this information regarding patrol rifles for your agency. If your agency posted a military equipment inventory that contains this information (quantity, make, model, caliber of patrol rifles), please direct us to a functioning URL with such inventory or provide a copy of that document. We recognize that some agencies consider patrol rifles to be standard issue (and so do not include them in AB 481 policies) and some agencies do not possess patrol rifles (although most do). \r\n\r\nWe would prefer to receive an inventory of patrol rifles currently possessed by the agency. However, if your agency does not possess an inventory of patrol rifles, we are requesting records with the equivalent information, through purchase records. Other agencies have indicated that such rifles have an expected functional life of between 10 and 20 years, which is why we request such records since 2007 (again, IF the agency does not have records including an inventory of patrol rifles). \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss this request, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, American Friends Service Committee, at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

Dear Peter Fugiel, On behalf of the Office of the Mayor, I am responding to your Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request which was dated April 30, 2023 and received in our office on the same day. At this time, the Office of the Mayor\u00a0is seeking an extension of five additional working days to respond to the requests for one or more of the following reasons identified in 5 ILCS 140/3(e) of FOIA: (xx) the requested records are stored in whole or in part at other locations than the office having charge of the requested records; (\u00a0 ) the request requires the collection of a substantial number of specified records; (\u00a0 ) the request is couched in categorical terms and requires an extensive search for the records responsive to it; (\u00a0 ) the requested records have not been located in the course of routine search and additional efforts are being made to locate them; (xx) the requested records require examination and evaluation by personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they are exempt from disclosure under Section 7 of the FOIA or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions; (\u00a0 ) the request for records cannot be complied with by the public body within the time limits prescribed by 5 ILCS 140/3(d) without unduly burdening or interfering with the operations of the public body; (xx) there is need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another public body or among two or more components of a public body having a substantial interest in the determination or in the subject matter of the request.

Dear Peter Fugiel, This correspondence is in response to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request received by the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor on April 30, 2023. The Office of the Mayor took a 5 business day extension to your request on May 8, 2023. You requested: \"To whom it may concern, \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nAll emails and attachments sent or received by Mayors Rahm Emanuel or Lori Lightfoot during the period 1/1/2017\u201312/31/2021 that contain any of the following phrases: \"fair workweek\", \"fair work week\" or \"fair scheduling\". \r\n\r\nThis request is being made for non-commercial research purposes.

The Mayor's Office will take no further action or send you any further correspondence unless and until your current request is narrowed in writing.\u00a0 If we do not receive your narrowed request within fourteen calendar days of the date of this letter, your current request will be denied. \r\n\r\nIn the event that we do not receive a narrowed request and your current FOIA request is therefore denied, you have the right to have a denial reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd Street, Springfield, Illinois 62706, (877) 299-3642. You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court. \r\nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office at 312-744-3844.

I recognize the need to balance the burden of fulfilling the request and the public interest in the information. While the latter side of the ledger is difficult to estimate as precisely as you have the former, I would note that the Chicago Fair Workweek Ordinance represents the most expansive labor standard of its kind. Along with a handful of other cities and one state, Chicago has established the most significant new rights and protections on working time since the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. My research seeks to understand the development and implementation of fair workweek laws, a project in which the National Science Foundation found sufficient merit to award me a competitive research fellowship (#2203815).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the considerable public interest in this information, I am willing to narrow my request to the period 1/1/2018\u201312/31/2019. I would still like a copy, preferably in electronic format, of all emails and attachments sent or received by Mayors Emmanuel or Lightfoot during the specified period that contain either of the phrases \"fair workweek\" or \"fair scheduling.\"\r\n\r\nI appreciate your continued assistance and look forward to your response to this narrowed request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel\r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\r\nRutgers School of Management & Labor Relations",

Dear Peter Fugiel, This correspondence is in response to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request received by the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor on June 06, 2023. The Office of the Mayor took a 5 business day extension to your request on June 13, 2023. You requested: \"Requesting to narrow my request to the period 1/1/2018\u201312/31/2019. I would still like a copy, preferably in electronic format, of all emails and attachments sent or received by Mayors Emmanuel or Lightfoot during the specified period that contain either of the phrases \"fair workweek\" or \"fair scheduling.\"\" \nPlease find the attached records responsive to your request. \nWe have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(b) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts \u201cprivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\u201d\u00a0 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b).\u00a0 Section 2(c-5) defines \u201cprivate information\" as: \n\nunique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses. Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. \n\n5 ILCS 140/2(c-5).\u00a0 The material we have redacted under this section is personal email addresses and personal phone numbers.\u00a0 Because these items are specifically exempted under Section 7(1)(b), they have been properly redacted. \nWe have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \n\n[p]ersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information.\u00a0 \u2018Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u2019 means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in in which the subject\u2019s right of privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.\u00a0 The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. \nWe have redacted under Section 7(1)(c) City issued cell phone numbers.\u00a0 As publicly-available City issued cell phone numbers would subject these employees to invasive and unsolicited communications, the disclosure of this information would burden employees\u2019 privacy interest. Additionally, the access to this information would not advance the public interest in understanding \u201cthe affairs of government and the official acts and policies of those who represent them[.]\u201d 5 ILCS 140/1. Further, the landline numbers and other email addresses for these employees is available to the public, which further limits the de minimis public interest in the contact information of the requested employees. See Shurtleff v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 991 F. Supp. 2d 1, 18 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2013) (\u201cThe EPA has proferred a substantial privacy interest at stake in disclosing the official internal email address of the EPA Administrator and the work email address of employees at the EOP: these few individuals have \u2018a significant personal interest in preventing the burden of unsolicited emails and harassment.\u2019\u201d); Buckovetz v. U.S. Department of the Navy, Case No. 14-cv-2115-BEN, 2016 WL 4801335 at *2-3 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 7, 2016) (affirming the redaction of an employee\u2019s cell phone number, because \u201cthe [employee\u2019s] privacy rights in this information outweigh the public\u2019s interest in disclosure\u201d).\u201d \nWe have redacted and withheld certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(f) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \n\nPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. \n\n5 ILCS 140/7(1)(f). The U.S. Supreme Court has determined that the deliberative process exemption under FOIA focuses on documents that reflect \u201cadvisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.\u201d NLRB v. Sears and Roebuck, 421 U.S. 132, 150-151 (1975).\u00a0 The purpose is to encourage \u201cfrank discussion of legal or policy matters\u201d such that employees in government feel free to express their opinions before a final legal or policy decision is made. \u201cDeliberative\u201d has been found to mean being a direct part of the process where recommendations and opinions are expressed. Vaughn v. Rosen, 523 F.2d 1136, 1143-44 (D.C. Cir. 1975). Records where preliminary opinions are expressed and policies and actions are formulated are therefore exempt from production under Section 7(1)(f) of the Illinois FOIA, and have been properly redacted and withheld. \nWe have redacted and withheld certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(m) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \n\nCommunications between a public body and an attorney or auditor representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body, and materials prepared or compiled with respect to internal audits of public bodies. \n\n5 ILCS 140/7(1)(m).\u00a0 Because the redacted and withheld records constituted privileged communications between an attorney and clients, they have been properly redacted and withheld under this section. You have the right to have a denial reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd Street, Springfield, Illinois 62701, (877) 299-3642. You may also seek judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office at 312-744-3844.

I have a couple of clarifying questions to be sure that these are the entirely of the records responsive to my request. \r\n\r\nFirst, would you confirm that only one email (with the subject \"Students Demand Action & Wisconsin Preemption - The DMO Digest\") was sent or received by Mayor Emanuel during the period 1/1/2018\u201312/31/2019? For context, the Committee on Workforce Development and Audit, then chaired by Mayor Emanuel's floor leader Patrick O'Connor, held multiple meetings on the proposed Fair Workweek Ordinance in April 2018. Am I to understand that your search return no emails updating Mayor Emanuel of the status of this proposal in the final months of his term in office?\r\n\r\nSecond, could you clarify why certain email attachments (\"Fair Workweek City Comparison 7.20.docx\" and \"BRIEF_0726_Osterman briefing.docx\") were not included in the records provided? It is not clear to me that a document comparing provisions of existing fair workweek laws meets any of the statutory requirements for exemption. The laws are public, so why would a document quoting/summarizing them be withheld? Similarly, I don't understand why a briefing document mentioning fair workweek would not be subject to disclosure now that the law has been enacted and Alderman Osterman and Mayor Lightfoot have left office.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any clarification or additional records you can provide at this time. Given the considerable public interest in the Mayors' leadership around this major piece of policy, I may need to submit additional requests if this one is too narrow to yield relevant records, e.g. from the Emanuel administration.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued attention to this matter,\r\nPeter Fugiel\r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "Dear Requester:\r\n\r\nA properly filed FOIA request must be submitted as stated on EOIR\u2019s website.\r\n\r\nAs of December 1, 2022, EOIR no longer accepts FOIA or PA requests by email. EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request an ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request an ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit an ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request an ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting an ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>\n",

The status of requests submitted by email or mail may not be trackable through the PAL, but you will still receive an email or mailed response to your request upon completion of processing. (https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx) Please ensure the email address you provided in PAL will be able to receive the messages we send you. Messages rejected by your email account will not be rerouted to you. \r\nPlease be aware that EOIR is a component of the Department of Justice\u00a0and the custodian of records for the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (ROP), which is the compilation of documents and digital audio recordings produced in proceedings before the immigration courts and the BIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the custodian of records for the \u201cA-file,\u201d which is a series of records of a person\u2019s immigration history and is maintained and stored by DHS. EOIR is not the custodian of records for DHS or its components, nor does EOIR have access to DHS\u2019s A-files. EOIR does not create an ROP until matters are initiated by DHS. Nevertheless, EOIR may create and maintain ROPs for proceedings other than removal proceedings (i.e., credible fear reviews, bond hearings). You may request a copy of your Notice to Appear (NTA) and full A-file from DHS. (https://www.dhs.gov/foia) \r\nNote that parties to immigration cases (including respondents and their representatives of record) have the option to request their Record of Proceedings directly from the immigration court or Board of Immigration Appeals. Please see the instructions here: https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest. (https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest) \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be significant delay in the processing of your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have filed a fee waiver request, EOIR will address the fee waiver in a separate letter. Most requests for records of proceedings do not require any fees; however, if the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed $25.00, EOIR will notify you before processing the request to determine whether you will commit to paying the fee or whether you wish to narrow the scope of your request to reduce the fee. Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \r\n\r\nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \r\n\r\nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.\u00a0 Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records.\u00a0 As a matter of default, your request has been placed in track two for simple requests.\u00a0 If you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at (703) 605-1297 or EOIR.FOIArequests@usdoj.gov to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request. Alternatively, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at (877) 684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nFOIA Intake",

        "communication": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nDuring the conference call that was held on Friday, February 23 to discuss Right-To-Know Law request number 24-RTKL-046 (copy attached), you had asked that our conversation be memorialized in writing and provided to you by today. Following are the key takeaways from the call:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   By end of day 2/23/24, the requester will select one change request regarding the CHIP IT transition for the department to provide a sampling of the records that were requested (i.e. copies of all materials, documents and communications related to the change request; materials may include but are not limited to: emails, cost estimates, invoices and any documents used to evaluate, assess and determine the impact of the change request; copies of any documents and materials showing whether the change requests were accepted, rejected or deferred) and to which access is granted.\r\n  *   By end of day 3/1/24*, the department will provide the sampling of records to which access is granted for the change request regarding CHIP IT transition selected by the requester on 2/23/24.\r\n  *   By end of day 3/18/24*, the department will provide the requested records (i.e. copies of all materials, documents and communications related to the change request; materials may include but are not limited to: emails, cost estimates, invoices and any documents used to evaluate, assess and determine the impact of the change request; copies of any documents and materials showing whether the change requests were accepted, rejected or deferred) to which access is granted for the following change requests regarding the CHIP IT transition:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     *   2952981: CHIP 39-day denial/termination removal\r\n     *   2691753: CHIP IT Transition MCO Transfer\r\n     *   2691771: CHIP IT Centre county coverage\r\n     *   2712791: CHIP IT - \"Consent to move to MA\" field must default to Yes\r\n     *   2728307: Transform CDE-MCO-TYPE values to 'K' for CHIP recipients on pro18wcare.dat file and P54/P58/P60 real-time responses\r\n     *   2760215: CHIP application start date\r\n     *   2773389: CHIP budgets need to align eligibility and enrollment date\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   After the requested records to which access is granted for the change requests regarding the CHIP IT transition have been provided to the requester, the department will search for, gather, and review responsive records for the remaining change requests listed in the RTKL request.  If upon review of the initial batch of records the requester wishes to narrow the request, the department asks that the requester inform us so that we can respond accordingly.\r\n  *   The department will provide to the requester an explanation of why information housed in the \"Team Foundation Server\" (TFS), which is the system that tracks change requests, cannot be exported/extracted.\r\n\r\n*These dates are contingent upon the number of responsive records and staff availability to search for, gather, and review responsive records. Additional time may be necessary.\r\n\r\nAttached is a revised interim response letter requesting additional time beyond 30 days, or until April 4, 2024, within which to provide a final response to your request. To allow time to complete the tasks that were agreed upon during our conference call, please reply to this email stating that you agree to the additional extension of time for the department to respond to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAndrea Bankes | Agency Open Records Officer\r\nOffice of Administration\r\nDepartment of Human Services\r\nRoom 234 Health & Welfare Building | Hbg PA 17120\r\nPhone: 717.787.3422 | Fax: 717.772.2490\r\nwww.dhs.pa.gov<http://www.dhs.pa.gov/>\r\n\r\nCreating partnerships to deliver quality services to customers through collaboration, consultation and supports.\n",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nA copy of a letter sent to Avril Haines, director of national intelligence, by Representative Rick Crawford, Republican of Arkansas, regarding anomalous health incidents, aka unconventionally-acquired brain injuries, aka Havana Syndrome. This letter is identified in a February 12, 2024 article in the New York Times, attached, as covering \"allegations of improper suppression\" of both information about anomalous health incidents and information about investigations into such claims conducted by American intelligence agencies.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting any supplemental materials that may have been attached to this letter, or in the absence of that, an inventory of all such materials with the names of the individual documents clearly identified.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to its research into anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAnomalous health incidents (AHI) are events occurring between 2016 and the present day that have resulted in a condition, or a series of related conditions, afflicting intelligence agents and diplomats working for the governments of the United States and Canada. In 2017, the Associated Press reported on a number of such incidents that happened in Cuba the year prior that led to the United States pulling staff from its embassy in that country. Since then, AHI have continued to generate considerable media attention and stories focusing on the national security implications have appeared in the New York Times and The New Yorker, among many other publications. Based on sources in the Intelligence Community, journalists working for these publications have suggested that AHI may have been caused by directed energy weapons, or ranged weapons that attack a target with electromagnetic radiation like ultra-high frequency radio waves.\r\n\r\nIn January 2022, however, the Central Intelligence Agency issued an interim report stating that the agency found no evidence to support claims that a foreign adversary such as Russia or China was responsible for causing AHI. This was supported by an intelligence assessment published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on March 1, 2023, which states, in part, \"most [Intelligence Community] agencies have concluded that it is 'very unlikely' a foreign adversary is responsible for the reported AHIs.\"\r\n\r\nAs of January 2024, there have been over 200 reported AHI and many of the victims themselves believe they were subject to attacks by directed energy weapons. Given that most of these individuals have been identified as high-ranking officials across multiple federal agencies, any investigations into claims of AHI and/or the effects of directed energy on humans would be of considerable public interest. This is especially important in light of the fact that, as part of the HAVANA Act of 2021, both Congress and the President approved compensation in the range of $140,000 or $187,000 per person to individuals diagnosed as suffering from AHI.\r\n\r\nAs of February 2024, Representative Brad Wenstrup, Republican of Ohio, and Representative April Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia, introduced a bill titled the Initiating Imperative Reporting on Anomalous Health Incidents Act which would require the Secretary of Defense to brief the House and Senate Armed Services Committees on AHI.\r\n\r\nRep. Crawford's letter to DNI Haines represents another instance of continuing interest in AHI shown by legislators, journalists, and the public and should be made available for public scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Dear William Fernandes,\r\n\r\nThis is in reply to your Freedom of Information Act request, dated January\r\n26, 2021 for German claims files G-3220, G-3273, G-3282, and G-0100. Your\r\nrequest was received in this office on January 27, 2020 and assigned the\r\ncase number 21-15142.\r\n\r\nBased on the information available on the Foreign Claims Settlement\r\nCommission website\r\n<https://www.justice.gov/fcsc/claims-against-german-democratic-republic-lead-decisions>,\r\nit appears that the claims you requested relate to the German Democratic\r\nRepublic (East Germany). These files are likely to be in the following\r\nseries:\r\n\r\n\r\n*Record Group 299: Records of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of\r\nthe United States, 1915 - 1999*\r\nEast Germany Claims Files, 1/1/1978 - 1990?\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/74616967>\r\nEntry UD-17W 1\r\n\r\nBox 4: Claims GDR-0091 to GDR-0125\r\nBox 121: Claims GDR-3202 to GDR-3228\r\nBox 123: Claims GDR-3263 to GDR-3295\r\n\r\nThe numbering scheme used in our finding aid is slightly different from the\r\nnumbering scheme you provided (our finding aids list a GDR- prefix rather\r\nthan G-); however, the information on the FCSC site leads us to believe\r\nthat these are the same records you are seeking. If, however, the claims\r\nfiles you seek are not related to East Germany, please let us know.\r\n\r\nThe East Germany Claims Files are fully restricted. Since these records\r\nneed to be reviewed for categories of information exempted from disclosure\r\nunder the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), we are transferring your\r\nrequest to the Special Access and FOIA staff for further action. The\r\nSpecial Access and FOIA staff will be in contact about the status of your\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this a denial of your FOIA request. However, if you are\r\nnot satisfied with our action on this request, your options for appeal and\r\ndispute resolution are outlined in the attachment. If you have any\nquestions, you may reach us at archives2reference@nara.gov.\r\n\r\nThis completes the processing of your request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid Castillo\r\nArchives Specialist\r\nTextual Reference Archives II Branch (RR2RR)\r\nNational Archives at College Park, MD",

Bier as the subject of the\r\n   records created between May 1978 and July 1990, and consisting of 45 pages.\r\n\r\nThese records require review for information protected from release under\r\nthe FOIA (https://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine).\r\n\r\nYour request does not exceed 700 pages, so it is assigned to our first-tier\r\nprocessing queue.

If\r\ncommunication is returned as undeliverable and no return address is\r\nprovided, your case will be administratively closed.

You also requested a waiver for reproduction fees ordinarily\r\ncharged to researchers.\r\n\r\nRecords transferred to the custody of the National Archives are exempt from\r\nthe fee and fee waiver provisions of the Freedom of Information Act because\r\na fee schedule was in effect prior to enactment. The applicable section\r\nstates that \u201cnothing in this subparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable\r\nunder a statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for\r\nparticular types of records\u201d (5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(4)(A)(vi)). The relevant fee\r\nstatute authorizes the National Archives \u201cto charge a fee for making or\r\nauthenticating copies or reproductions of materials transferred to the\r\nArchivist\u2019s custody.\u201d (44 U.S.C. 2116(c)). The inability to grant the\r\nrequested fee waiver does not constitute a denial under the terms of the\r\nFreedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with our action on this request, you have the\r\nright to file an administrative appeal within ninety (90) calendar days\r\nfrom the date of this letter. Appeals must be in writing and may be\r\ndelivered by regular U.S. mail or by email. By filing an appeal, you\r\npreserve your rights under the Freedom of Information Act and present the\r\ndeciding agency with an opportunity to review your request and reconsider\r\nits decision. If you submit your appeal by regular mail, it should be\r\naddressed to the Deputy Archivist of the United States (ND), National\r\nArchives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 4200, College\r\nPark, Maryland 20740-6001.

Your request was received in this office on\r\nFebruary 2, 2021, and assigned FOIA tracking number 65006, interim tracking\r\nnumber RF-519. You also requested a waiver for reproduction fees ordinarily\r\ncharged to researchers.\r\n\r\nRecords transferred to the custody of the National Archives are exempt from\r\nthe fee and fee waiver provisions of the Freedom of Information Act because\r\na fee schedule was in effect prior to enactment. The applicable section\r\nstates that \u201cnothing in this subparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable\r\nunder a statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for\r\nparticular types of records\u201d (5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(4)(A)(vi)). The relevant fee\r\nstatute authorizes the National Archives \u201cto charge a fee for making or\r\nauthenticating copies or reproductions of materials transferred to the\r\nArchivist\u2019s custody.\u201d (44 U.S.C. 2116(c)). The inability to grant the\r\nrequested fee waiver does not constitute a denial under the terms of the\r\nFreedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with our action on this request, you have the\r\nright to file an administrative appeal within ninety (90) calendar days\r\nfrom the date of this letter.

As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v.

The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files, memos, emails and other records mentioning or describing Lawrence\r\n    Sigmund Bittaker (September 27, 1940 \u2013 December 13, 2019) or Roy Lewis\r\n    Norris (February 5, 1948 \u2013 February 24, 2020), also known as the Tool Box\r\n    Killers, who were two American serial killers and rapists who kidnapped,\r\n    raped, tortured, and killed five teenage girls in Southern California over a\r\n    period of five months in 1979.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

However, in reviewing your request I do not see a date range in which you are seeking responsive records.  Please let me know what date range you are asking us to search within.  This will allow me to complete the search in a timely fashion.  Additionally, the inclusion of common names (i.e. Karen etc.) is likely to capture numerous communications that may or may not be relevant to your intended request.  To the extent you are able to provide more specific search terms it will aid in processing the request and reduce the volume of unrelated items that are pulled.  Finally, the inclusion of \"Morrisey\" as a search term will result in any emails or communications with the Attorney General's name in signature blocks.  Again, to the extent you are able to provide clarity on the information sought or let me know which search terms should be search in conjunction with each other, rather than each individually, it will aid in processing your request so that we are able to provide the information you are seeking.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to email me at this address or call me at 304-558-1482 to discuss this matter at your convenience.\r\n\r\nOnce I have received the date range, and any other clarification, I will be able to provide you with a date our response will be provided.\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSteven\r\n\r\nSteven A.

        "communication": "Dear Esteemed Appeals Officer,\r\n\r\nI pen this missive with the earnest intent of appealing the lamentable withholding of the \"Amendment to DS Employment Contract\" and other germane materials mentioned in the agenda for the annual board meeting of March 29, 2023, at the Capital Region BOCES. As a steadfast pursuer of truth and justice, I have observed an unfortunate pattern of concealing essential information from the citizenry, both prior to, during, and after the board's meetings.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law (FOIL), I submitted a request for all draft or final materials presented or discussed during the annual board meeting, which encompassed the amended agreement between the Albany-Schoharie-Schenectady-Saratoga BOCES and District Superintendent Anita M. Murphy. Despite receiving a response containing a presentation related to the budget, notice of meeting acknowledgment, and agenda, the document in question and other vital materials were not provided.\r\n\r\nThis practice of obscuring material information from the public is not only incompatible with the values of openness and accountability, but it also erodes the people's confidence in the board's decision-making process. The Open Meetings Law (OML) obliges public bodies to make available to the public all materials discussed or presented during a meeting. The non-disclosure of the \"Amendment to DS Employment Contract\" and other significant materials is a clear contravention of this imperative.\r\n\r\nIn light of these concerns, I humbly request that you reconsider the initial decision and furnish me with a copy of the \"Amendment to DS Employment Contract\" and all other pertinent materials mentioned in the agenda. Furthermore, I entreat the board to adopt appropriate measures ensuring that all relevant information and documents are made available to the public in a timely and transparent manner, consonant with the requirements of both the FOIL and OML.\r\n\r\nAs an additional observation, it has come to my attention that the following link on BoardDocs, which ought to provide details on the \"Amendment to DS Employment Contract,\" remains devoid of any information: http://go.boarddocs.com/ny/crboces/Board.nsf/goto?open&id=CQ7QCV67C36B. This absence of information serves to further underscore the necessity for prompt action in addressing the aforementioned concerns.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your attention to this matter of considerable import and eagerly anticipate your prompt response in accordance with the statute's requirement.",

Lists of Title IX complaints are publicly available on the Sexual Violence Prevention and Response - Policies and Reports<https://sexualviolence.ucdavis.edu/annual-reports> page. These annual reports go back to 2014-2015, and the 2022-2023 report is being compiled as we speak. It will be posted to the website in April 2024.\r\n\r\n     *   Internal communications within the University of California, Davis regarding Title IX complaints filed during the above academic years.\r\n\r\n                                                               i.      Internal communications regarding Title IX complaints are exempt from disclosure pursuant to Government Code \u00a7 7922.000, where \"...the public interest served by not disclosing the record[s] clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record[s].\" Particularly, \"[t]he disclosure of materials would expose an agency's decision-making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency's ability to perform its functions, and \"frank discussion[s] of legal or policy matters might be inhibited if subjected to public scrutiny.\" (California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Ct. (1998) 67 Cal. App. 4th 159, 170. See also Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Ct. (1991) 53 Cal. 3d 1325.) Disclosure of such investigative records would impair the privacy of investigation participants, impair the integrity of the investigation and decision-making process, discourage reporting of employee misconduct, and discourage participation of complainants and witnesses.\r\n\r\n                                                             ii.      Additionally, these communications are exempt to protect individual privacy under the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\") (20 U.S.C. 1232g, student privacy), the California Information Practices Act (\"IPA\", Civil Code section 1798 et. seq., employee privacy), the California Constitutional right to privacy, and the common law right to privacy. Both the California Constitution and the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") expressly contemplate that under certain circumstances, the privacy rights of individuals supersede the right of public access to public records. The University is required to apply a \"balancing test\" in such cases to determine whether the individual's privacy interest outweighs the public right of access, given the specific facts at issue.\r\n\r\n     *   Any records relating to Title IX complaints filed from January 1, 2024 to February 14, 2024.\r\n\r\n                                                               i.      See attached\r\n\r\n\r\n     *   In addition to the above request, I would like the raw data for all reports made to the Title IX Compliance office for the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 academic years, omitting identifying information where necessary.\r\n\r\n                                                               i.      If the raw data you are looking for is not contained in these reports, let me know.\r\n\r\nWith the delivery of this email and the records herein we are considering your request closed.  Should you have any questions or wish to request additional records please contact publicrecords@ucdavis.edu<mailto:publicrecords@ucdavis.edu> or call (530) 754-6295<tel:(530)%20754-6295>.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nLara\r\n\r\nLara H.

Your request was received in the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) FOIA office on August 26, 2020 and assigned the FHFA FOIA request number 2020-FOIA-050.  Please refer to this number in any correspondence concerning your request.\r\nYou requested the following information:\r\n\"Any correspondence: text messages, emails, memos, etc. Describing how the 50 bps Adverse Market Reaction game to be, why the date September 1st was chosen, and how 50bps was determined to be fair. Correspondence regarding how it was determined that this adverse market reaction fee would have no impact on the average consumer. Any research regarding this Adverse market reaction fee. Any correspondence: text messages, emails, memos, etc. Describing the reason for the delay to December 1st..\"\r\n\r\nYou also requested expedited processing.  FHFA will grant expedited processing pursuant to the FOIA and FHFA regulation, 12 CFR Part 1202.10, if the request demonstrates a compelling need by establishing one or more of the following:\r\n\r\n  1.  Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;\r\n  2.  An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks are NOT the \u201cfederal government\u201d) if you are a person primarily engaged in disseminating information;\r\n  3.  The loss of substantial due process or rights;\r\n  4.  A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the Federal Government\u2019s integrity, affecting public confidence; or\r\n  5.  Humanitarian need.\r\nMerely stating that \u201cI request\u2026expedited processing since this is of the utmost interest to the general public as this adverse market reaction fee could cost consumers billions.\u201d does not provide sufficient information to grant your request for expedited processing. Therefore, your request for expedited processing is denied and your FOIA request will be processed in the order it was received. You may appeal the FHFA\u2019s decision regarding your request for expedited processing pursuant to FHFA regulation, 12 CFR Part 1202.10(c).\r\nPlease note that the FHFA processes requests under a multi-track system (standard and complex).  After review of your request, it has been determined that your request will be placed in the complex track. FOIA requests are placed in this track based on the volume and/or complexity of records requested. Currently, your request is number 15 in the request queue.\r\nYour FOIA request is releasable to the public under subsequent FOIA requests. In responding to these requests, FHFA does not release personal information, such as home or email addresses and home or mobile telephone numbers, all of which are protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 6 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6)).\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the processing of your request, please contact me directly at stacy.easter@fhfa.gov<mailto:stacy.easter@fhfa.gov>.\r\n\u200b\r\nSincerely,\r\nStacy J.

        "communication": "CONTROLLED\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 15, 2020\r\n\r\nRe: FHFA FOIA No. 2020-FOIA-050\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Ricker:\r\n\r\nThis letter is in response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, dated August 25, 2020. Your request was received in the FOIA office on August 26, 2020 and assigned the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) FOIA request number 2020-FOIA-050.  Please refer to this number in any correspondence concerning your request. Your request was processed in accordance with the FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) and the FHFA's FOIA regulation (12 CFR Part 1202).\r\n\r\nYou requested the following\r\n\r\n\"Any correspondence: text messages, emails, memos, etc. Describing how the 50 bps Adverse Market Reaction [c]ame to be, why the date September 1st was chosen, and how 50bps was determined to be fair. Correspondence regarding how it was determined that this adverse market reaction fee would have no impact on the average consumer. Any research regarding this Adverse market reaction fee. Any correspondence: text messages, emails, memos, etc. Describing the reason for the delay to December 1st.\"\r\n\r\nA search of FHFA files and records did not locate any records responsive to your request. While Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (the Enterprises) and/or the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) may have responsive documents in their files, our search consisted of FHFA files only.\r\n\r\nUnlike FHFA, the Enterprises and the FHLBanks are private entities and are not obligated to comply with a request made under the FOIA. Under the FOIA, only \"agency records\" are subject to disclosure. The FOIA defines \"agency records\" as records that are (1) either created or obtained by an agency, and (2) under agency control at the time of the FOIA request. See U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 942 U.S. 136, 144 (1989). See also Wolfe v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 711 F.2d 1077, 1081-82 (D.C. Cir. 1983).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the purpose of the FOIA is to open the actions of government agencies to public scrutiny, not to reveal the inner workings of private entities. FHFA's regulation and conservator responsibilities does not transform the Enterprises and the FHLBanks records into \"agency records\" subject to the FOIA. Further, FHFA has no duty under the FOIA to search for or request production of documents in the Enterprises and the FHLBanks possession. Nor does the FOIA require the Enterprises' and the FHLBanks to search for responsive information. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Fed. Housing Fin. Agency, 744 F, Supp. 2d 228, 235 (D.D.C. 2010)(quoting Consumer Fed'n of America v. Dep't of Agric., 455 F.3d 283, 288 (D.C. Cir. 2006))(\"[U]se is the decisive factor here.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is FHFA's final decision on your FOIA request. If you wish to appeal any aspect of FHFA's decision, you must forward within 90 days:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   A copy of your initial request;\r\n  *   A copy of this letter; and\r\n  *   A statement of the circumstances, reasons, or arguments for seeking disclosure of the affected record(s).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be sent either electronically by 5pm to foia@fhfa.gov or postmarked within 90 days and mail to the \"FOIA Appeals Officer\" at 400 7th Street, SW, 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20219. The subject line, or the envelope and the letter of appeal, must be clearly marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Please note that all mail sent to FHFA via the United States Postal Service is routed through a national irradiation facility, a process that may delay delivery by approximately two weeks. For any time-sensitive correspondence, please plan accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration. OGIS can be reached at 8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; by email at ogis@nara.gov; by telephone at 202-741-5770 or toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or by facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nYour FOIA request is releasable to the public under subsequent FOIA requests. In responding to these requests, FHFA does not release personal information, such as home or email addresses, and home or mobile telephone numbers, which are protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 6 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6)).\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the processing of your request, please contact me directly at stacy.easter@fhfa.gov<mailto:stacy.easter@fhfa.gov>.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStacy J.

The search terms used in that search were \u201c50 bps + adverse market reaction.\u201d  In regards to emails, unfortunately we can\u2019t search the entire agency\u2019s emails system. That would require a lot of man power that we do not have.  Only after an office informs me that they may have responsive documents can I identify individuals to search.  Because I want you to be satisfied with our search, give me until the end of the day tomorrow to see what additional information I can find.  My supervisor is out today and I think he would be able to assist me with figuring this out.\r\n\nStacy",
