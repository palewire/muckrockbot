Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

But as you might guess, the request references a large number of records.

We have a couple of questions or matters we want to clarify up front:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Are we correct that you want the listed variables in your request for both licensed and license-exempt facilities?\r\n  2.  Please note that only Provider Name and Physical Address can be provided for license-exempt facilities and our information only goes back to June 2023.\r\n\r\nA fee will be assessed for this request but your responses to the above will obviously impact how much it will cost. Our online child facility public database may have much of what you are looking for. It can be found here:  Child Care Provider Search<https://www.msdh.provider.webapps.ms.gov/ccsearch.aspx>\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that Miss. Code Ann. 25-61-5(1)(b) allows a state entity to respond to a public records request by up to fourteen (14) business days assuming the entity has informed the requestor it will not be able to respond in seven (7) and gives reasons for it. My guess is this will take longer than seven days given the scope of information you are looking for and the limited staff available to put together our response.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nDavy Trewolla\r\n\r\nDAVY TREWOLLA, ESQ, CHP\r\nData Governance Director\r\n\r\nMississippi State Department of Health\r\n570 East Woodrow Wilson Drive\r\nJackson, MS 39216\r\nOffice: 601-576-7855\r\nEmail: David.Trewolla@msdh.ms.gov\r\n[Image]\r\nTo protect and advance the health,\r\nwell-being and safety of everyone\r\nin Mississippi\r\nmsdh.ms.gov<https://msdh.ms.gov/>\r\n[Facebook]<https://facebook.com/HealthyMS> [Instagram] <https://instagram.com/healthy.ms>  [X] <https://x.com/msdh>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message and any attachments may contain information that is confidential and/or proprietary to the Mississippi State Department of Health, and may consist of sensitive information, including, but not limited to, protected health information as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Please note that certain private information (personal email addresses, etc.) was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7. Specifically, section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. Student information has been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). Please be advised that there are no records responsive to point two of your request.

This response applies only to records that exist and\r\nare in the custody of the Planning Department. (See \"A Guide to the\r\nMassachusetts Public Records Law\", (2022) p. 32, n. 115).\r\n\r\n\u202fSpecifically, you requested:\r\n\r\n*\"...all emails from Dec 2024 related to the Boston Water and sewer\r\nproject.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n\u202fThere is a\u202fpresumption\u202funder the Massachusetts Public Records Law that\r\ngovernment records are public; however, government records custodians are\r\npermitted to redact or withhold portions of public records, so long as a\r\nspecific exemption to the law is cited.\u202f(See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (26))\r\n\r\nThe Planning Department has exercised (2) exemptions in reviewing your\r\nrequest:\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. Privacy Exemption: We have redacted the personal email addresses and\r\n   cell phone numbers belonging to individuals that appear in the responsive\r\n   records. When redacting this personal information, the Planning\r\n   Department relied upon the second clause of the privacy exemption set forth\r\n   in *G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(c)*. It is the position of the Planning\r\n   Department that the release of personal email addresses and cell phone\r\n   numbers would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. In\r\n   taking this position, the Planning Department believes that such\r\n   information constitutes \"intimate details of a highly personal nature,\" as\r\n   personal email addresses and cell phone numbers are not typically otherwise\r\n   available for public consumption. In weighing the protection of privacy\r\n   interests versus the public interest in disclosure, the Planning Department\r\n   ultimately determines that providing this information would amount to an\r\n   unwarranted intrusion into the privacy of the individuals. Further, any\r\n   public interest in the disclosure of personal email addresses and cell\r\n   phone numbers does not outweigh the privacy interest held by the\r\n   individuals.\r\n\r\n   2. The Deliberative Process Exemption: We have withheld (2) emails and\r\n   (2) working drafts of a Purchase and Sale Agreement based on the\r\n   Deliberative Process Exemption. The Deliberative Process Exemption is\r\n   intended to avoid release of materials that could taint the deliberative\r\n   process if prematurely disclosed. Its application is limited to\r\n   recommendations on legal and policy matters found within an ongoing\r\n   deliberative process that are contained within inter-agency or intra-agency\r\n   memoranda or letters. The City's internal planning for the development\r\n   of the BWSC Parking Lots is ongoing and, as such, any and all documents\r\n   concerning the City's ongoing internal planning are protected from\r\n   disclosure under the deliberative process exemption. (See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7\r\n   7(26)(d))\r\n\r\nIn answer to your public records request, please find the responsive\r\nrecords through the link below:\r\n\r\n*PRR 12.18.2024 - BWSC Communications_December 2024*\r\n<https://bpda.box.com/s/9t0zx85m15p5m5ae0ikfy7sps4b2ql9v>\r\n\r\nUnder Massachusetts law, you may appeal this response to the Supervisor of\r\nRecords in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth.

        "communication": "Good Morning Brian,\r\n\r\nI apologize for any confusion. A response to your public records request\r\nfrom December 18, 2024, was sent to you on January 24, 2025. Below, I have\r\nincluded the original correspondence, which contains the link to the\r\nresponsive records.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDanielle\r\n\r\n*Email sent January 24, 2025:*\r\n\r\nHello Brian,\r\n\r\nThis email shall act as the Planning Department's response to your request\r\nfor public records. This response applies only to records that exist and\r\nare in the custody of the Planning Department. (See \"A Guide to the\r\nMassachusetts Public Records Law\", (2022) p. 32, n. 115).\r\n\r\n\u202fSpecifically, you requested:\r\n\r\n*\"...all emails from Dec 2024 related to the Boston Water and sewer\r\nproject.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n\u202fThere is a\u202fpresumption\u202funder the Massachusetts Public Records Law that\r\ngovernment records are public; however, government records custodians are\r\npermitted to redact or withhold portions of public records, so long as a\r\nspecific exemption to the law is cited.\u202f(See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (26))\r\n\r\nThe Planning Department has exercised (2) exemptions in reviewing your\r\nrequest:\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. Privacy Exemption: We have redacted the personal email addresses and\r\n   cell phone numbers belonging to individuals that appear in the responsive\r\n   records. When redacting this personal information, the Planning\r\n   Department relied upon the second clause of the privacy exemption set forth\r\n   in *G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(c)*. It is the position of the Planning\r\n   Department that the release of personal email addresses and cell phone\r\n   numbers would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. In\r\n   taking this position, the Planning Department believes that such\r\n   information constitutes \"intimate details of a highly personal nature,\" as\r\n   personal email addresses and cell phone numbers are not typically otherwise\r\n   available for public consumption. In weighing the protection of privacy\r\n   interests versus the public interest in disclosure, the Planning Department\r\n   ultimately determines that providing this information would amount to an\r\n   unwarranted intrusion into the privacy of the individuals. Further, any\r\n   public interest in the disclosure of personal email addresses and cell\r\n   phone numbers does not outweigh the privacy interest held by the\r\n   individuals.\r\n\r\n   2. The Deliberative Process Exemption: We have withheld (2) emails and\r\n   (2) working drafts of a Purchase and Sale Agreement based on the\r\n   Deliberative Process Exemption. The Deliberative Process Exemption is\r\n   intended to avoid release of materials that could taint the deliberative\r\n   process if prematurely disclosed. Its application is limited to\r\n   recommendations on legal and policy matters found within an ongoing\r\n   deliberative process that are contained within inter-agency or intra-agency\r\n   memoranda or letters. The City's internal planning for the development\r\n   of the BWSC Parking Lots is ongoing and, as such, any and all documents\r\n   concerning the City's ongoing internal planning are protected from\r\n   disclosure under the deliberative process exemption. (See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7\r\n   7(26)(d))\r\n\r\nIn answer to your public records request, please find the responsive\r\nrecords through the link below:\r\n\r\n*PRR 12.18.2024 - BWSC Communications_December 2024*\r\n<https://bpda.box.com/s/9t0zx85m15p5m5ae0ikfy7sps4b2ql9v>\r\n\r\nUnder Massachusetts law, you may appeal this response to the Supervisor of\r\nRecords in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. (G.L. c.\r\n66,\u202f\u00a7\u202f10A; 950 CMR 32.08)\nBest,\r\nDanielle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*----*\r\n\r\nDanielle Cournoyer (pronouns she/her/hers)\r\n\r\n Public Records Specialist\r\n\r\n Planning Department\r\n\r\n City of Boston\r\n\r\n 617-918-4448 (w)",

Trump.\r\n\r\nThis request seeks to understand how the school district interacts with federal immigration authorities and whether students, staff, or families have been subject to inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions by ICE.\r\n\r\nScope of Request: Specific Records Sought\r\n\r\nI request copies of all relevant records, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Communications Between Peekskill City School District and ICE\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of all emails, letters, faxes, text messages, internal memos, and reports exchanged between PCSD officials, school administrators, security personnel, or school resource officers (SROs) and ICE from January 1, 2025, to the present regarding:\r\n\t\u2022\tAny requests for student, staff, or family immigration status information.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny ICE investigations, detainer requests, or inquiries involving individuals associated with the Peekskill school district.\r\n\t\u2022\tProtocols followed when ICE agents or law enforcement personnel request access to school property or student records.\r\n\r\n2. School District Policies on ICE and Immigration Enforcement\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of all policies, directives, or procedures issued by PCSD concerning:\r\n\t\u2022\tCompliance or non-compliance with ICE detainers or information-sharing requests.\r\n\t\u2022\tHow school officials and staff are instructed to respond to ICE agents requesting access to students or records.\r\n\t\u2022\tPolicies regarding notification to parents, legal guardians, or attorneys when a student or family member is targeted by ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tWhether the district follows New York State\u2019s sanctuary policies that limit local cooperation with ICE.\r\n\r\n3. Training Materials and Guidance for Staff\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any training materials, guidance documents, or legal briefings provided to:\r\n\t\u2022\tSchool administrators, teachers, and counselors regarding how to handle ICE interactions.\r\n\t\u2022\tSchool resource officers (SROs) or any security personnel on how to respond to ICE enforcement actions on school grounds.\r\n\t\u2022\tPolicies regarding student and family privacy rights under FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) in relation to ICE data requests.\r\n\r\n4. Agreements, MOUs, and Data Sharing with ICE\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), agreements, or contracts between Peekskill City School District and ICE, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tAny formal agreements allowing ICE access to school records, facilities, or personnel.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny federal funding, grants, or financial incentives provided to the district for cooperation with ICE.\r\n\r\n5. Records of ICE Visits or Enforcement Actions in Schools\r\n\t\u2022\tAny incident reports, call logs, visitor logs, or law enforcement records documenting:\r\n\t\u2022\tICE agents visiting Peekskill schools for questioning, detentions, or surveillance.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny students, faculty, or parents detained or questioned on school grounds.\r\n\r\nLegal Justification for Disclosure\r\n\r\nThis request is consistent with New York\u2019s commitment to transparency under FOIL and aligns with the principle of public oversight of government actions affecting vulnerable populations (New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, under Buffalo Broadcasting Co. v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Correctional Services, 155 A.D.2d 106 (3d Dep\u2019t 1990), the courts have upheld that non-exempt information related to public institutions must be disclosed to ensure government accountability.\r\n\r\nNew York State has taken steps to protect immigrant students from unwarranted federal intervention in schools (Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980)). This request seeks to ensure compliance with these state protections and evaluate whether local policies align with federal and state laws.\r\n\r\nObligation to Preserve and Provide Records\r\n\r\nUnder Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993), government entities must preserve and disclose records that may be subject to public information laws. Accordingly, I request that no responsive records be deleted, altered, or destroyed while this FOIL request is under review.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all applicable fees for processing this request. Disclosure of these records serves a critical public interest in ensuring the protection of immigrant students and families and is not for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nUnder Matter of New York Times Co. v. City of New York Fire Dep\u2019t, 4 N.Y.3d 477 (2005), fee waivers should be granted when disclosure benefits the general public by fostering informed discussions about government policies and their impact.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $100 in processing fees. Please notify me in advance if costs will exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nGiven the heightened concerns over immigration enforcement and student rights, I request expedited processing of this FOIL request. Under Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980), timely disclosure of information concerning public safety and legal compliance is essential for public oversight.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nAs per Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a), I expect an acknowledgment of receipt within five (5) business days and a timeline for completion.\r\n\r\nPlease provide electronic copies of records whenever possible. If any records are withheld or redacted, I request a written explanation citing specific legal exemptions in accordance with Gould v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 89 N.Y.2d 267 (1996).\r\n\r\nContact Information\r\n\r\nShould you require any clarification or additional details, please contact me at Jordan@Lassiter.eu.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report",

Proof\r\n    of death is not required as his execution was widely reported:\r\n    (https://web.archive.org/web/20100323145212/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/11/14/cia.killings.execution/).\r\n    Per FBI standards and regulations, this is acceptable proof of death.\r\n    \r\n    Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not\r\n    limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone\r\n    Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and\r\n    the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and\r\n    cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and\r\n    companies.

        "communication": "Good Morning Mr. Galante,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Mir Qazi.  By letter dated August 27, 2019, you were informed that the estimated total cost for processing your request was approximately $745.00 for CD releases.  By email dated October 4, 2019, you indicated your willingness to pay $30.00 in FOIA processing fees.  In the meantime the FBI located approximately 33,072 pages potentially responsive to your request and the current estimated total cost for processing your request is approximately $985.00 for CD releases.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size.\r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex x-large request processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  The current average time to complete an x-large track request is at least 70 months.\r\n\r\nRIDS resumed full staffing on June 8, 2020.  Commensurate with the return of full staffing levels, RIDS will being increasing its FOIA processing production.  While RIDS will make its best efforts to meet increased production goals, this increased production rate may be negatively impacted by COVID-19 workplace disruptions.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of all tracks and the average time approximately to complete each.  Hopefully this breakdown will be helpful to you in reducing the scope of this request.\r\nSimple track request (0- 50 pages) current average time is approximately 4 months to complete.\r\nMedium track request (51-950 pages) current average time is approximately 27 months to complete.\r\nLarge track request (951-8000 pages) current average time is approximately 57 months to complete.\r\nX-Large track request (over 8000 pages) current average time is approximately 70 months to complete.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\nStatus Checks:  foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\n",

        "communication": "RE: Request Number Request Number: CDA-2025-99 Submitted on: 1/13/2025 \r\n  \r\n Dear Adam Steinbaugh, \r\n  \r\n For the County to continue to process your request for records, we require additional information. \r\n  \r\n In an effort to provide our department with clearer instruction to conduct an accurate and complete search in response to your request, we kindly seek additional clarification and narrowing. \r\n  \r\n A search may be conducted using certain key terms or phrases such that if the specific key term or phrase appears (such as in an email), that communication would be retrieved and would populate in the search results. In part 1 of your request, we understand that you have already listed some key terms and phrases as follows: \r\n  \r\n \"Museum\" \r\n \"Sally\" \r\n \"Mann\" \r\n \"pornography\" \r\n \"porn\" \r\n \"indecent\" \r\n \"decent\" \r\n \"decency\" \r\n  \r\n However, also in part 1 of your request, you have language, \"which concerns or mentions the Modern art Museum of Fort Worth.\" In order to ensure that the relevant and responsive emails you are seeking populate in the search using key terms, would you consider adding additional key terms in lieu of this language? For example, in addition to key terms/phrases 1-8 above, our suggestion is that you might add the following key terms / phrases: \r\n  \r\n 9. \"Modern Art\" \r\n  \r\n 10. \"Modern Art Museum\" \r\n  \r\n 11. \"Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth\" \r\n  \r\n 12. \"Museum of Fort Worth\" \r\n  \r\n 12. \"Fort Worth Museum\" \r\n  \r\n Also, would you omit the phrase \"including (but not limited to)\" in part 1 as to allow the key terms to operate as intended to limit the search to those key terms/phrases? \r\n  \r\n Would you be agreeable to the modifications and narrowing above? \r\n  \r\n Item 1 lists Tim O'Hare as one of the subjects of the communications but does not list any other individual to whom those communications were engaged with. Item 2 lists Tim O'Hare and \"the Modern art Museum of Fort Worth\" but does not list individuals. Would you be able to provide names, job titles, email addresses, etc. of other individuals of whom Judge O'Hare would have potentially had communications with so that our search may be limited to communications between Judge O'Hare and those individuals? \r\n  \r\n We hope that you are able to provide some clarification and narrowing so that we may streamline the request to the items you are seeking without unnecessarily generating additional cost or labor. \r\n  \r\n Per Texas Government Code section 552.222, if a written response to this request for clarification or narrowing is not received within 61 days, your request is considered withdrawn. \r\n  \r\n Please respond to all when responding to these emails to ensure that our staff sees your responses. \r\n  \r\n Description of records requested: \r\n  \r\n To Whom It May Concern: Pursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, I hereby request the following records: 1. Any communications sent to or from Tim O'Hare on or after December 1, 2024, which concerns or mentions the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, including (but not limited to) any communications containing any of the following terms: Museum, Sally, Mann, pornography, porn, indecent, decent, decency. 2. Any communications between Tim O'Hare and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth on or after December 1, 2024. Please note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request. \"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. Sincerely, \r\n  \r\n Thank you, \r\n Tarrant County Criminal District Attorney's Office \r\n 401 W.

Emails between Judge Tim O'Hare and any individual email address containing \"themodern.org\" in the email address (domain) on or after December 1, 2024. \r\n  \r\n The following are additional areas in which we seek additional clarification and narrowing. \r\n  \r\n For Item 1: \r\n  \r\n Would you also like to narrow the \"communications\" down to only emails as you did in item 2? \r\n Would you provide a list of individuals to include in the search as either sender or recipient of communications (or just emails) to and from Judge Tim O'Hare? \r\n  \r\n For Item 2: \r\n  \r\n Would you be able to provide a list of key terms as you did in item 1? We could use the same key terms list from item 1 for the search in item 2 if you wish. If you have other key terms in mind, please list them out for item 2. \r\n  \r\n We hope that you can provide additional clarification and narrowing as to the 3 highlighted areas discussed above. \r\n  \r\n Per Texas Government Code section 552.222, if a written response to this request for clarification or narrowing is not received within 61 days, your request is considered withdrawn.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to all when responding to these emails to ensure that our staff sees your responses.\r\n\r\nOriginal Description of records requested:\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern: Pursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, I hereby request the following records: 1.

These include, but are not limited to, dates of birth, social security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, license plates, VINs, medical records, attorney work product, email addresses of members of the public (private citizens who are not County employees) pursuant to Texas Government Code 552.137(a), and family member information of public employees pursuant to Texas Government Code 552.1175 and 552.024. \r\n  \r\n If you are agreeable to allowing this office to withhold information that is not subject to public release, please reply to this e-mail letting us know.

Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

This request was rejected on the grounds that I could not demonstrate that disclosure of the requested records to me would constitute a \"significant\" benefit to public knowledge of NASA'a activities. Specifically, my claim was characterized as \"speculative.\" In considering my appeal, I ask whomever it may concern to consider that, in addition to my qualifications as stated in the original request, I am the editor-in-chief of a magazine (currently digital but soon to be in print) called \"Cultural Engineering Studies,\" and I personally contributed an article to this magazine on NASA's relationship to Hollywood--an almost unexplored topic. So it seems arbitrary to conclude that this information will not benefit public awareness in a \"significant\" way. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for considering my appeal,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern: \r\n \r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nRylee Meints\r\nJ.D. Candidate\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration \r\nmeints.r@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRylee Meints",

The University has determined that it possesses documents that are responsive to your request. However, the University anticipates that some of the responsive documents, or portions of them, may be exempt from disclosure under the Act. \r\n  \r\n The Freedom of Information Act authorizes the University to collect fees not to exceed the actual cost of searching for, retrieving, redacting, and making copies of the records you have requested. The Act also authorizes the University to require you to post a deposit of 25% of the estimated costs before searching for or making copies of the records. \r\n  \r\n The University estimates that the total cost it will incur to respond to your request will be $6.25. Therefore, you must post a deposit of at least $1.56 before it gathers the records you requested. If you would like to proceed with your request in its current form, then please forward a check payable to \u201cUniversity of South Carolina\u201d to me at your earliest convenience. The University will make the non-exempt documents that are responsive to your request available to you as soon as reasonably possible after it receives your deposit. \r\n  \r\n The South Carolina Family Privacy Protection Act, SC Code section 30-2-10 et seq., prohibits a person or entity from obtaining or using personal information from records obtained from University for purposes of commercial solicitation as defined in that Act. A person or entity that violates the Act is subject to criminal penalties, including possible fines and imprisonment. If you obtain records from the University, you are certifying that you will not obtain or use these records for commercial solicitation in violation of the South Carolina Family Privacy Protection Act. \r\n  \r\n \r\nYour deposit check should be forwarded to the following address:\r\n\r\nFOIA\r\nOffice of Communications and Marketing\r\nUniversity of South Carolina\r\nOsborne Administration Building, Suite 107\r\nColumbia, SC 29208 \r\n  \r\n Please make out your check to \"University of South Carolina\" and indicate your request number somewhere on or attached to the check. \r\n  \r\n \r\nWe will acknowledge receipt of your check via email. \r\n  \r\n Please contact us if you have any questions in connection with the foregoing.\r\n\r\nShannon Beaudry\r\nFOIA Coordinator\r\n803-576-7715\r\nfoia@sc.edu\r\nCommunications and Marketing\r\nUniversity of South Carolina",

Sanford was also briefly employed as as Special Agent of\r\n    the FBI from 1941 to 1942, prior to enlisting with the Army. Proof of death\r\n    is not required as his date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n    \r\n    Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not\r\n    limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone\r\n    Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and\r\n    the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and\r\n    cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and\r\n    companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite\r\n    locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both\r\n    investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any\r\n    potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to\r\n    NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as\r\n    any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer\r\n    or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the\r\n    Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records\r\n    are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records\r\n    while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

FOIA is not a search mechanism.\u00a0 Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.\u00a0 For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. \nThe FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records. \nThis is not a denial of your request for records. Please resubmit your FOIA request, along with a more detailed description of the records being sought, by logging into your existing FOIAOnline account or creating an account at https://foiaonline.gov. (https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/) \nSincerely, \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection",

Please be advised we do maintain a historical Brady List. If you do wish to obtain a copy of the historical Brady List a deposit would be required. The list would need to be reviewed for any cases that may have been sealed or expunged. Please advise if you would like us to send a deposit letter.\r\nIn regards to items 2, each file that is applicable to your request would need to be manually pulled and reviewed for any potential exemptions and/or redactions that may be necessary.
