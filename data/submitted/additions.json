To confirm, this FOIA request is distinct from previous ones, as I\u2019m seeking empty templates of forms utilized by the Stamford Police Department for citizens to obtain Freedom of Information records, rather than completed forms over an extended period. If  further clarification is needed, please feel free to let me know.\r\n\r\n Please be so kind as to provide blank versions of any paper or electronic forms used by the City of Stamford Police Department from January 1, 2019, to July 15, 2023, for citizens making Freedom of Information requests. One copy of each form version, if multiple versions exist, will be adequate to fulfill this inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\nPolice\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Meehan",
