        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nIn a sworn declaration in J. Doe 1-26 vs. Musk (https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.576293/gov.uscourts.mdd.576293.77.2.pdf), Jeremy Lewin stated that he has been employed at USAID since 1/28/2025 as a Senior Advisor. He also declares he has never worked for Elon Musk or the USDS. Jeremy Lewin was also among the initial team of DOGE staffers that arrived at the CFPB on or around 2/6/2025. He was also identified as being on the staff list at the National Institute of Health along with other identified DOGE staffer in an article published in Wired on 2/24/2025. I would like to request the following information where possible:\r\n\r\nFor USAID:\r\n1. Any confirmation that Jeremy Lewin was formally hired at USAID on or before 1/28/2025\r\n2. If Jeremy Lewin was detailed to the USAID from another agency, any relevant details on that arrangement that you can share, including a memorandum of understanding (or similar document) outlining his duties and responsibilities of each partner, as well as emails between the USAID and the other agency about the arrangement. I would expect this to be on our around Feb 6, 2025\r\n\r\nFor the CFPB and possibly USAID:\r\n3. If Jeremy Lewin was hired by the CFPB, any details you can share on that appointment, including if he signed the relevant onboarding paperwork as a new hire at the agency. I would expect this to be on or around February 6, 2025\r\n4. If Jeremy Lewin was detailed to the CFPB from another agency, any relevant details that can be shared on the memorandum of understanding (or similar documents) outlining his role and the responsibilities of each partner in this arrangement, as well as emails about the detailing arrangements where available in either USAID/State or the CFPB. I would expect these communication to be on or around February 6, 2025\r\n\r\nFor NIH and possibly USAID/CFPB:\r\n5. If Jeremy Lewin was detailed to the National Institute of Health from the USAID or CFPB, I would like to request the corresponding memorandum of understanding or other relevant documents about that arrangement, as well as any relevant email communications you can provide from any other agency to the National Institutes of Health about that arrangement. I do not have a precise date for this, but I would expect it to be in February 2025 before 2/24/2025\r\n\r\nFor US Doge Service:\r\n1. If you have any records that show that Jeremy Lewin was hired as an employee of USDS at any time in January or February 2025, I would appreciate that.\r\n2. Any communications between the USDS and other agencies (USAID/Department of State) coordinating the detailing of Jeremy Lewin to agencies like the CFPB alongside other staff employed by USDS\r\n\r\nI understand that you might not be able to provide me some agency-internal personnel records under FOIA exemptions 2 and 6, but I think it is in the public interest to understand the coordination among these agencies, and I would hope you would be able to provide me whatever relevant details can help provide more insight on what was being done in these partnerships. Please reach out if you need any clarification or want to give me feedback on my requests. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Harris",

Any communications between the USDS and other agencies (USAID/Department of State) coordinating the detailing of Jeremy Lewin to agencies like the CFPB alongside other staff employed by USDS. FOIA Specialist our request has been assigned to Pamela Arrington, FOIA Specialist.\u00a0 You may contact Pamela Arrington\u00a0by email at parringtoncampbell@usaid.gov or by phone on 202-921-5010. \u00a0Please reference the tracking number cited above in any future correspondence. Extending the FOIA\u2019s Time Limits due to Unusual Circumstances The FOIA provides that an agency \u00a0may extend its time limits when \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d occur\u00a0in the processing of a request. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i) (2016).  Those \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d are set forth in the statute, 5 U.S.C \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii), and are described as: 1) The need to search for records from field facilities or other locations separate from the office processing the request; 2) The need to search, collect and examine voluminous records; and 3) The need for consultation with another agency. Based upon the records you have requested, we have determined that one or more unusual circumstances will occur during the processing of your request.  Accordingly, your response time-limit has been extended beyond the 20 days required by statute; therefore, 10 additional processing days have been added to your request. To mitigate this action, you may limit the scope of the request so that it can be processed more quickly or to arrange an alternative time to respond. \nlease note, as reported by various public sources and acknowledged across federal service channels, USAID is undergoing a broad realignment of programs and responsibilities. These shifts, coupled with reduced staffing levels and increasing litigation demands, have significantly impacted our FOIA processing capacity. If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact the assigned FOIA Specialist noted above. You may also contact USAID\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, Christopher Colbow, at foia@usaid.gov (mailto:foia@usaid.gov) . \n\nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services offered: Office of Government Information Services National Archives and Records Administration 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001 E-mail: ogis@nara.gov Telephone: 202-741-5770; Toll Free: 1-877-684-6448 Fax: 202-741-5769 Thank you for your interest in USAID.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern:  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. \r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:  \r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)  \r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and  \r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).   \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.  \r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).  \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis\r\n\r\nJ.D.

Also note that improperly addressed (i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the department number) requests might be returned as undeliverable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 21, 2025:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Data on school-based arrests (Seekonk Police Department)\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis\r\n\r\nJ.D.

I request copies of any memos, studies, or other such records dated Jan 1, 2020, through the date you complete your search, referencing (1) the Justice Department resources spent or expected to be spent litigating Freedom of Information Act cases or (2) the frequency with which the government has won or lost Freedom of Information Act cases.  I'm not looking for individual emails that happen to make mention of these subjects, but rather, more formal studies or other such records that are the results of a more formal evaluation.  I'm happy to discuss the scope with you.  By \"resources\" I mean the costs in terms of attorney/staff hours, FTEs, or salaries.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

If not, is there a pay grade on a pay plan each incumbent falls on?\r\n  *\r\nand a pay plan or scale that you use for staff employees\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have job descriptions for the staff classifications and a handbook for them in electronic format, that would be helpful in comparison to our client data. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:21ecd649-40e8-41ca-a26f-9c4b580de57b]\r\n\r\nEvergreen Solutions<https://outlook.office.com/mail/consultevergreen.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVery Respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlisia Rios, MSIOP\r\n\r\nData Analyst \u2013 She/Her\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvergreen Solutions, LLC<https://www.consultevergreen.com/>\r\n\r\n2528 Barrington Circle Unit 201\r\n\r\nTallahassee, FL 32308\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice:   (850) 383-0111\r\n\r\nCell:       (850) 661-0341\r\n\r\nEmail:    alisia@consultevergreen.com<mailto:alisia@consultevergreen.com>\r\n\r\nPartnering with public-sector clients to effect positive change",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of March 24, 2025, Reference # M000536-032425. \r\nDear Police News, \r\nThe Volusia Sheriff's Office Records Section received a public information request from you on March 24, 2025. Your request mentioned: \u201cTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nOn June 18, 2022, Iyanna Rollins, 18, was arrested by Volusia County Sheriff's Sgt. Chad Weaver at 2629 Academy Ave in Deltona, Florida. Weaver mistakenly responded to the wrong address for a burglary alarm and confronted Rollins as she was backing out of a driveway. The situation escalated quickly, and Rollins was charged with four felonies, including battery on a law enforcement officer. Bodycam footage was released following criticism on social media regarding the deputy\u2019s conduct. In April 2023, Rollins\u2019 attorney filed a motion to suppress evidence, citing Fourth Amendment violations. \r\n\r\nI am requesting access to all records related to the arrest of Iyanna Rollins by Sgt. Chad Weaver on June 18, 2022, at or near 2629 Academy Avenue, Deltona, Florida: \r\n\r\nAll body-worn camera footage from Sgt. Chad Weaver and any other responding deputies. \r\n\r\nAny dash camera footage from patrol vehicles involved in the incident. \r\n\r\nAny rear seat camera footage from the vehicle in which Rollins was transported. \r\n\r\nThe full incident report, arrest report, and any supplemental or narrative reports. \r\n\r\nAudio of dispatch communications or 911 calls related to the original burglary alarm. \r\n\r\nAny internal communications or emails regarding the public release of the footage. \r\n\r\nAny social media video or surveillance footage obtained or referenced by the Sheriff's Office. \r\n\r\nIf any additional records exist regarding the motion to suppress or internal discussion of the arrest controversy, I would also request those under this same request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nPolice Cam News \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fvolusia-county-sheriffs-office-7559%252Fpublic-records-request-arrest-of-iyanna-rollins-at-2629-academy-ave-june-18-2022-183773%252F%253Femail%253Dcustodianofrecords%252540vcso.us&url_auth_token=AAAQIsWBpkyaDfWyo9fNLYCmQqw%3A1twewz%3ARq4laDjwNtykh_vKiI1OS4NW75mxZVZLpXcC46E9_fY\u201d \r\nThe Volusia Sheriff's Office Records Section has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request.

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests take longer than a month to complete.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public.\u00a0 You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

With the FOIAXpress application, the PAL is the best method for EPA to release voluminous records to our Requesters, without encountering MB-limiting firewalls and such transmission impediments.\r\n\r\nThe Agency is working diligently to solve this FOIAXpress issue.  In the interim, we have taken the step to \"push\" a system-generated invitation to create a PAL account to you.  You should receive an email from address noreply_nfo@epa.gov<mailto:noreply_nfo@epa.gov> with instructions on how to take the next steps to successfully establish the PAL account.\r\n\r\nIf you chose to establish this account, this would then ensure that all future interim and final responses from your FOIA requests to EPA will be available for download via the PAL.  It will also allow you to submit any new requests to U.S. EPA using your PAL account.\r\nRegards,\r\nRebecca Clausen, on behalf of the\r\nEPA FOIAXpress Implementation Team",

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Elizondo-Pinochi: \r\n\r\nI  previously submitted a public records request to the Nevada Department of Corrections (NDOC) regarding current mental health staff. I was informed that NDOC does not maintain these records and that the Department of Administration (specifically Human Resources) is the custodian, to which I submitted a public records request.\r\n\r\nHowever, the DOA has now replied stating they are not the custodian and referred me back to NDOC. To simplify the request and avoid unnecessary burden, I\u2019d like to narrow the scope to a single question:\r\n\r\nCould you kindly provide the name(s) and contact information (email or phone) for the individual or individuals responsible for overseeing mental health or behavioral health programming within Nevada Department of Corrections facilities \u2014 such as a Chief Psychologist, Mental Health Director, or similar supervisory role?\r\n\t\u2022\tFull name\r\n\t\u2022\tJob title\r\n\t\u2022\tAssigned facility\r\n\t\u2022\tWork email and/or phone number (if available)\r\n\t\u2022\tDepartment (e.g. Behavioral Health)\r\n\r\nI understand many services are contracted out \u2014 if that\u2019s the case, any direction you could offer (e.g. relevant points of contact at the contracting entity) would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nFor context: I\u2019m reaching out as part of a nonprofit initiative exploring the possibility of offering free meditation-based rehabilitation programming to incarcerated populations across the U.S., including Nevada. Similar programs have been successfully implemented in state and federal prisons in the U.S. and abroad, with evidence showing significant benefits to inmate well-being and facility safety.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and support.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nAndrew Ma",

Clerical (ESPA), Security (ESPA) Maintenance and Operations (TSPA) is civil service: https://www.niagaracounty.gov/employment/job_specs_for_civil_service_positions.php.
