Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each quarter from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2018.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: \r\n\r\nFRZ_VIEW_LONG_DT\t\r\nPERS_AREA_NAME\t\r\nEMP_LAST_NAME\t\r\nEMP_FIRST_NAME\t\r\nJOB_LONG_NAME\t\r\nFT-PT\tADDRESS_1\t\r\nADDRESS_2\t\r\nCITY\t\r\nSTATE\t\r\nZIP\t\r\nHire Date\t\r\nSeparation Date\t\r\nContract Type\t\r\nAnnual\tHourlyRt\t\r\nPerDiem\r\n\r\nThis is a carbon copy of my request for more recent data from 2019 - 2022, which I submitted on 11-15-2022. \r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",
