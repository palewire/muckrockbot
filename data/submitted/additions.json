I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records responsive to Charles Berlitz, aka Charles Frambach Berlitz, aka Charles Frambach-Berlitz, aka Charles Frambach (November 22, 1914 \u2013 December 18, 2003). Mr. Berlitz was born Charles Frambach in 1914 in New York City, New York, but later changed his name, either legally or professionally, to Charles Berlitz. He was an heir to the Berlitz School of Language (now Berlitz Corporation) line of language schools founded by his grandfather, Maximilian Berlitz, in 1878; served in the United States Army as an intelligence officer for 26 years, retiring as a Lieutenant-Colonel; and wrote a series of New York Times best-selling books on paranormal subjects, including \"The Bermuda Triangle\", \"The Roswell Incident\", and \"Atlantis: The Lost Continent\".\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Berlitz's privacy, as he passed away in 2003. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Berlitz's obituary, published in the Washington Post on December 31, 2003.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
