October 27, 2007), including files 100-HQ-248516 and 100-CG-12890. Previously released records indicate Durham was the subject of wiretapping and had at least one informant reporting on his activities. The following symbol sources were directed at Durham between 1954 and 1956: CG 5974-S, CG 5985-S, CG 6040-S* (https://archive.org/details/FBI-ELSUR-nsia/18-cv-01868%20pp%202770-3077%20-%20ELSUR%20Indices%20-%20Chicago%20Section%204/page/n299/mode/2up; https://archive.org/details/FBI-ELSUR-nsia/18-cv-01868%20pp%203298-2482%20-%20ELSUR%20Indices%20-%20Chicago%20Section%206/page/n93/mode/2up) Proof of death is not required as his death was widely reported: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/chicagosuntimes/name/earl-durham-obituary?id=29644078 (This is a reprint of an obituary that originally appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times); https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?GAID=10&SessionID=76&GA=95&DocTypeID=SR&DocNum=422&LegID=48589&SpecSess=&Session= (Illinois State Senate resolution commemorating Durham)\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPaul Galante",
