This request includes any emails sent to the official email address of the Governor's Office or any other email address associated with the Governor that contain threats or hostile language.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer to the following case laws:\r\n\r\nBooth Newspapers, Inc. v. Univ. of Mich., 444 Mich. 211 (1993): This case held that the Michigan Freedom of Information Act is to be interpreted broadly in favor of disclosure, and any exemption to disclosure must be narrowly construed.\r\n\r\nDetroit Free Press, Inc. v. City of Lansing, 269 Mich. App. 143 (2005): This case established that public bodies must disclose public records upon request unless they are specifically exempted from disclosure under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nUAW Local 6000 v. Dep't of Transp., 226 Mich. App. 299 (1998): This case held that public records are to be construed broadly in favor of disclosure, and exemptions to disclosure are to be construed narrowly.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in a readable electronic format, such as PDF, and include all email attachments and metadata associated with the requested email communications.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is denied or exempt from disclosure, please cite the specific exemption and provide an index of the withheld or redacted records, as required by law.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold or delete responsive documents will be appealed in a court of law. Any such actions may result in legal proceedings to compel the production of the records and any applicable penalties. I also request that any responsive records be provided on a rolling basis, meaning that records should be provided as they become available instead of waiting for all records to be collected before responding to the request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan",
