        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Oregon Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am submitting a public records request for records sufficient to demonstrate how the University of Oregon satisfies the statutory notice requirement under ORS 659A.279 for the safety-related leave protections set out in ORS 659A.270\u2013659A.285.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, this request concerns the employer-administered statutory protection itself, which exists independently of the Paid Leave Oregon wage-replacement program and applies regardless of whether leave is paid or unpaid, including public-employer obligations such as the 160-hour leave bank.\r\n\r\nPlease provide records showing the following:\r\n\r\n1. Notice content and location\r\n\u2022\tThe specific notice(s), webpage(s), posting(s), or written materials the University relies on to \u201csummarize the provisions\u201d of ORS 659A.270\u2013659A.285, as required by ORS 659A.279;\r\n\u2022\tWhere those notices are posted or maintained, including physical locations and URLs;\r\n\u2022\tThe date each notice or posting went into effect and any revisions made since 2019.\r\n\r\n2. Procedures available to employees\r\n\u2022\tAny written procedures, guidance, or internal instructions explaining how an employee invokes the statutory protection with the University;\r\n\u2022\tIdentification of the office(s) responsible for administering the protection;\r\n\u2022\tPolicies or guidance explaining how the protection functions when Paid Leave Oregon benefits are unavailable, exhausted, or not applicable;\r\n\u2022\tAny materials intended to allow employees to plan around the protection, including timing, documentation, duration, and job-protection effects.\r\n\r\n3. Transition and change records (2019\u20132026)\r\n\u2022\tRecords documenting the transition from earlier certification forms and processes in use in or around 2019 to later versions used in 2026;\r\n\u2022\tAny drafts, approvals, internal communications, or decision-making records associated with revising or replacing those forms or procedures;\r\n\u2022\tRecords reflecting how the University evaluated whether revised forms, postings, or procedures continued to comply with ORS 659A.279 following the implementation of Paid Leave Oregon;\r\n\u2022\tAny records addressing how employees were notified of changes in forms, routing, or administration.\r\n\u2022\tAny written policies, procedures, workflows, routing instructions, or standard operating procedures used by Human Resources, HR Leaves, or other offices when an employee requests safety-related leave and Paid Leave Oregon benefits are unavailable or exhausted, including records addressing whether and how the employee is routed to University-administered unpaid leave or the 160-hour public-employer leave bank.\r\n\r\nIf the University contends that no responsive records exist for any portion of this request, please confirm that position in writing.\r\n\r\nClarification regarding parallel processes:\r\n\r\nTo avoid any confusion, this public records request is submitted pursuant to Oregon Public Records Law only and does not waive, replace, or otherwise affect any requests, grievances, or RFIs I have submitted through my union or any other employment-related process, many of which remain pending.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted because I require timely access to records necessary to understand my statutory protections and to plan accordingly. The public records process is the only mechanism currently available to obtain this information within a reasonable timeframe.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKelvin Shivers II",
