View High School (as it is located close to the band area, and is used with permission for Period 0 students attending Jazz Band class), during the time in which Troy O'Dell, Councillor at Mt. View High School, stopped a student (identified as Felix Keplar, the child of the requesting party), raised his voice, yelled and gestured aggressively, for an extended period of time; if audio is available, audio should also be included.  The doorway in question contains signage stating that parents and visitors are not permitted entry at the door; I believe the door is to the west/northwest side of the building and is adjacent to rear parking.\r\n\r\nI further request any an all communications between administrative staff, teachers and  other employees of Evergreen Public Schools that reference any complaints levied by parents, students or employees, against Troy O'Dell, or any incidents where Mr. O'Dell acted with inappropriate anger or otherwise showed potential impulse control issues in the execution of his duties.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
