It is not, however, a mechanism for posing and receiving answers to written questions.  As stated in FOIL Advisory Opinion 16632a<https://docsopengovernment.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f16632a.htm>, issued by the New York State Committee on Open Government:  \u201cVery simply, there is nothing in the Freedom of Information Law or the Open Meetings Law that requires that government officers or employees respond to questions, supply information in response to questions or offer explanations for their governmental activities.\u201d  Furthermore, as explained in FOIL Advisory Opinion 18795<https://docsopengovernment.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f18795.html>, \u201can agency need not create a record in response to a request for information.\u201d  Therefore, to the extent that the College does not maintain records which may be responsive to several of the questions listed below (i.e., average tenure, current turnover rate, how frequently are job description updated), the FOIL statute does not require to a public agency to create records in order to respond to a FOIL request.\r\n\r\nNote that once responsive records \u2013 i.e., the College\u2019s payroll and collective bargaining agreements -  are gathered in response to this FOIL request, they may contain answers to some the questions posed below (i.e., how are salaries adjusted, date compensation plan(s) were implemented, do you compensate faculty differently based on the area of discipline, etc.).  However, the answers will be able to be retrieved from a review of the relevant collective bargaining agreements.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlla Brodsky, Esq.\r\nDeputy General Counsel\r\nSuffolk County Community College\r\nAmmerman Campus\r\nEmail: brodskya@sunysuffolk.edu<mailto:brodskya@sunysuffolk.edu>\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL\r\nATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION/ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT\r\nINTER-OFFICE/INTRA-AGENCY COMMUNICATION\r\nNOT SUBJECT TO FOIL DISCLOSURE/NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION\n",

A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u2018Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u2019 link.  Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,370 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request medium processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is August 2025.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.

        "communication": "Thank you for your inquiry regarding the status of your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy (FOIPA) request.   A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u2018Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u2019 link. Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks-simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into small, medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track extra-small requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days, medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,370 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request small processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is April, 2025.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please indicate so and a representative will be in contact.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence.  Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com<http://MuckRock.com> FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records. Below are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency. Your initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records. Exact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253). Your non-exhaustive obligations: - All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27). - All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26). - You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)). - You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)). - You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)). - Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service. Your agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints. ****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ****** In simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request: 1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i). 2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions) Do not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations. FYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \" However, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i). Thank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Anonymous\".\r\n\u200b\r\nThe immediate disclosure process is for requests that are \u201csimple, routine or otherwise readily answerable.\u201d Please see San Francisco Administrative Code section 67.25(a). Your request is not simple or routine. The maximum deadline for responding to a request applies. The Department is looking into your request and will provide you with a response within 10 calendar days but no later than by March 03, 2020. Please refer to California Government Code Section 6253(c).\r\n\u200b\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the Police Commission Office at 415-837-7070.\r\n\u200b\r\n\u200b\r\nSincerely,\r\n\u200b\r\nSergeant Stacy Youngblood\r\nOfficer in Charge\r\nPolice Commission",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission Office is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Perfecto Barbosa (OIS 2014-0003):\r\n\r\n  *   Copy of April 2, 2014 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 5a - Chief's performance evaluation on their decision on whether or not to return  the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\nPer Penal Code sec. 832.7 the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and additional documents related to the closed session item as they relate to an uninvolved officer's personnel record.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   March 17, 2014 RTD letter from Chief Suhr to Commissioner Mazzucco\r\n  *   March 28, 2014 RTD letter from Chief Suhr to Commissioner Mazzucco\r\nThe Commission redacted portions of page 2 of the March 28, 2014 RTD letter pursuant to California Government Code sec. 6254(c), Article I, sec. 1 of the California Constitution and Penal Code sec. 832.7 (5)(c) and (6) because disclosure of this information would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\r\n\r\n  *   Summary of Investigative Finding in case OIS 2014-0003\r\n  *   June 30, 2016 FDRB agenda\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Perfecto Barbosa and no additional responsive records for OIS 2014-0003\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code Section 6253(c), the Police Commission hereby avails itself of the time limit extension set forth therein for responding to your request due to the need to search for, collect, and examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request.    The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will continue to provide you responsive records on a rolling basis The Commission will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than  Friday, March 13, 2020.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nPolice Commission\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nPolice Commission\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock).

The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission Office is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficers Nathan Chew, Roger Morse, Richard Schiff, and Jason Sawyer (OIS 2014-0004):\r\n\r\n  *    Copy of April 2, 2014  Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 5a - Chief's performance evaluation on their decision on whether or not to return  the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n Per Penal Code sec. 832.7 the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and additional documents related to the closed session item as they relate to an uninvolved officer's personnel record.\r\n\r\n  *   March 28, 2014 RTD letter from Chief Suhr to Commissioner Mazzucco\r\n  *   Summary of Investigative Findings in OIS 2014-0004\r\n  *   2nd Quarter 2015 RDRB Findings and Recommendations\r\n  *   June 23, 2015 FDRB agenda\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officers Morse, Schiff, and Sawyer and no additional responsive records for OIS -2014-0004.\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code Section 6253(c), the Police Commission hereby avails itself of the time limit extension set forth therein for responding to your request due to the need to search for, collect, and examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request.    The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will continue to provide you responsive records on a rolling basis The Commission will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than  Friday, March 13, 2020.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nPolice Commission\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission Office is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Roderick Suguitan (OIS 2019-0001):\r\n\r\n  *    Copy of September 11, 2019 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 9b - Chief's performance evaluation on their decision on whether or not to return  the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\nPer Penal Code sec. 832.7 the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and additional documents related to the closed session item as they relate to an uninvolved officer's personnel record.\r\n\r\n  *   September 6, 2019 RTD letter from Chief Scott to Commissioner Hirsch\r\nThe two redactions on page 1 and the one redaction on page 2 of the September 6, 2019 RTD letter were made pursuant to California Government Code sec. 6254(c), Article I, sec. 1 of the California Constitution and Penal Code sec. 832.7 (5)(c) and (6) because disclosure of this information would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2019-0001.\r\n\r\nOfficer Michael Shavers (OIS 2019-0002):\r\n\r\n  *    Copy of October 2, 2019 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 8a - Chief's performance evaluation on their decision on whether or not to return  the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\nPer Penal Code sec. 832.7 the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and additional documents related to the closed session item as they relate to an uninvolved officer's personnel record.\r\n\r\n  *   September 20, 2019 RTD letter from Chief Scott to Commissioner Hirsch\r\nThe three redactions of page 2 of the September 20, 2019 RTD letter were made pursuant to California Government Code sec. 6254(c), Article I, sec. 1 of the California Constitution and Penal Code sec. 832.7 (5)(c) and (6) because disclosure of this information would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2019-0002.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Shavers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficers Sterling Hayes and Christopher Flores (OIS 2019-0003):\r\n\r\n  *    Copy of January 8, 2020 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 9b - Chief's performance evaluation on their decision on whether or not to return  the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\nPer Penal Code sec. 832.7 the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and additional documents related to the closed session item as they relate to an uninvolved officer's personnel record.\r\n\r\n  *   January 8, 2020 RTD letter from Chief Scott to Commissioner Hirsch\r\nThe one redaction on page 2 and the one redaction on page 3 of the January 8, 2020 RTD letter were made pursuant to California Government Code sec. 6254(c), Article I, sec. 1 of the California Constitution and Penal Code sec. 832.7 (5)(c) and (6) because disclosure of this information would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officers Hayes and Flores and no additional responsive records for OIS 2019-0003.\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code Section 6253(c), the Police Commission hereby avails itself of the time limit extension set forth therein for responding to your request due to the need to search for, collect, and examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request.

Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding your request for \"2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions).\"\r\n\r\nYou have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty also to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 97-98 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will  not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nWe have compiled the set of responsive records for 9 Officer Involved Shooting and these 14 individual officers provided to you earlier.  That responsive records took approximately 12 hours to complete.  Because of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than  Friday, March 13, 2020.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission has the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Patrick Griffin and Officer Michael Tursi:\r\nOIS 2011-0003:\r\n\r\n  *   Copy of the July 6, 2011 Police Commission public Agenda which includes closed session item 6c - Chief's performance evaluation on their decision on whether or not to return the officers to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\nPer Penal Code section 832.7(a), the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and additional documents related to the closed session item as they relate to an uninvolved officer's personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n  *   July 6, 2011 RTD letter from Chief Suhr to Commissioner Mazzucco\r\n  *   OIS Summary of Investigation for OIS 2011-0003\r\n  *   January 14, 2014 agenda for 3th quarter 2013 FDRB\r\n  *   4th quarter 2013 FDRB findings and recommendations\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for OIS -2011-0003\r\n\r\nOfficer Patrick Griffin and Office Constantine Zachos:\r\nOID-2006-0003\r\n\r\n  *   March 29, 2006 FDRB agenda\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Patrick Griffin, for OIS 2011-0003 or OID-2006-0003.  The Commission will continue working to determine if there are additional responsive records for Officer Constantine Zachos.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code Section 6253(c), the Police Commission hereby avails itself of the time limit extension set forth therein for responding to your request due to the need to search for, collect, and examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request.    The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will continue to provide you responsive records on a rolling basis The Commission will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than  Friday, March 27, 2020.\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission has the following additional responsive records for Officer Reginald Scott:\r\nOfficer Reginald Scott (OID 2007-0012):\r\n\r\n*         March 21, 2008 1st Quarter 2008 FDRB agenda\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OID 2007-0012.\r\n\r\nOfficer Reginald Scott (OIS 2007-0005):\r\n\r\n*         June 4, 2007 2nd quarter 2007 FDRB agenda\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for Officer Reginald Scott or OID 2007-0005.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code Section 6253(c), the Police Commission hereby avails itself of the time limit extension set forth therein for responding to your request due to the need to search for, collect, and examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission has the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nNoah Mallinger and Terrance Saw (OIS 2011-0001)\r\n\r\n*        Copy of the January 19, 2011 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 8d - Chief's performance evaluation on their decision on whether or not to return the officers to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer Penal Code section 832.7(a), the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and additional documents related to the closed session item as they relate to an uninvolved officer's personnel record.

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\nThe Commission is providing you with the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Mary Godfrey (OIS 2013-0003):\r\n\r\n\r\n*         Copy of the August 15, 2012 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 6b - Chief's performance evaluation on their decision on whether or not to return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer Penal Code section 832.7(a), the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and additional documents related to the closed session item as they relate to an uninvolved officer's personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n\r\n*         July 27, 2012 RTD letter from Chief Suhr to Commissioner Mazzucco\r\n\r\n*         OIS summary of investigation for OIS 2012-0003\r\n\r\n*         March 31, 2015 1st quarter FDRB agenda\r\n\r\n*         1st quarter 2015 FDRB findings and recommendations\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Mary Godfrey or OIS 2012-0003.",

Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation.

Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you with the following responsive records:\r\nOfficer Jose Guardado (OIS 2006-0008):\r\n\r\n*        OIS 2006-0008 Summary of Investigation\r\n\r\n*        September 18, 2007 FDRB agenda (the case is listed as OIS 2006-0007, but that is an error).  The case is OIS 2006-0008.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Jose Guardado or OIS 2006-0008",

Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you with the following responsive records:\r\nOfficer Fabian Fowler (OIS 2006-0006):\r\n\r\n*        September 13, 2006 Police Commission\r\n\r\nPer Penal Code section 832.7(a), the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and additional documents related to the closed session item as they relate to an uninvolved officer's personnel record.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records. \r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency. \r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records. \r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253). \r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations: \r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27). \r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26). \r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)). \r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)). \r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)). \r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service. \r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints. \r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ****** \r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request: \r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i). \r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions) \r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations. \r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you with the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficers Tasawan Casey Kevin Endo (OIS 2018-0003):\r\n\r\n*         April 11, 2018 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 7a - Chief's performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officers to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\n*         June 6, 2018 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 9c - Chief's performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officers to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items or both meetings as they relate to an uninvolved officer's personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n*         March 28, 2018 RTD letter from Chief Scott to Commissioner Turman\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2018-0003 of for Officers Casey or Endo.",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you with the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Kenneth Cha (OIS 2017-0001):\r\n\u2022             January 18, 2017 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 6a \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officers to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items or both meetings as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n\u2022            January 17, 2017 RTD letter from Chief Chaplin to Commissioner Turman\r\n\r\nOfficer Kenneth Cha (OIS 2017-0003):\r\n\r\n\u00b7         June 14, 2017 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 8g \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officers to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items or both meetings as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n\u2022            May 10, 2017  RTD letter from Chief Scott to Commissioner Turman\r\nThe one redaction on page 2 of the May 10, 2017 letter was made pursuant to PC 832.7(b)(5)(C).\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2017-0001, OIS 2017-0003 of for Officer Kenneth Cha.",

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you with the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficers Wiloran Ravelo and Jason Robinson (OIS 2017-0005):\r\n\u2022             November 8, 2017 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 8c \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officers to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items or both meetings as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\u2022             September 8, 2017 RTD letter from Chief Scott to Commissioner Turman\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2017-0005 of for Officers Wiloran Ravelo or Jason Robinson.",

Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you with the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Dack Thompson (OIS-20017-0004)\r\n\u2022             June 14, 2017 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 8h \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officers to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\n\u00b7         June 21, 2017 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 6b \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not to return the officer  to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items for both meetings as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n\u2022             May 26, 2017 RTD letter from Chief Scott to Commissioner Turman\r\n\r\nOfficer Dack Thompson (OID-2008-0004)\r\n\r\n\u00b7         July 30, 3008 2nd Quarter 2008 FDRB agenda\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2017-0004, OID 2008-0004 or Officer Dack Thompson.",

We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you with the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nSgt.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock).

In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you with the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nLt. Renota Martinez (OID-2006-0009):\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7         4th Quarter 2006 FDRB agenda\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for OID 2006-0009 or Lt. Renata Martinez.",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Roderick Suguitan:\r\nOIS 2010-0001:\r\n\r\n  *   February 3, 2010 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 9b \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n\u2022        January 28, 2010 RTD letter from Chief Gascon to Commissioner Marshall\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2010-0001 Summary of Investigations\r\n  *   4th Quarter 2010  FDRB agenda\r\n  *   4th Quarter 2010 FDRB Findings and Recommendations letter\r\n  *   Redacted transcript from 4th Quarter 2010 FDRB; specific redactions on each page of the transcript are referenced to the Police Commission\u2019s Redaction Index which is attached.  The full discussion of OIS 2010-0001 was not captured on the audio recording.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Suguitan.",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Matthew Friedman (OIS 2010-0014):\r\n\r\n  *   January 5, 2011 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 7a \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n\u2022        December 17, 2010 RTD letter from Chief Gascon to Commissioner Mazzucco\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2010-00014 Summary of Investigation\r\n\r\n  *   4th Quarter 2011 FDRB agenda\r\n  *   4th Quarter 2011 FDRB Findings and Recommendations letter\r\n  *   Redacted transcript from 4th Quarter 2010 FDRB; specific redactions on each page of the transcript are referenced to the Police Commission\u2019s Redaction Index which is attached.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Matthew Friedman or OIS 2010-0014.",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Daniel May\r\nOIS-2004-0003:\r\n\u00b7        OIS 2004-0003 Summary of Investigation (there is an error in the document listing it as related to OIS 2004-0002, however this document relates to OIS 2004-0003)\r\nOIS 2009-0003:\r\n\r\n\u00b7         September 2, 2009 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 9a \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n\u2022        August 31, 2009 RTD letter from Chief Gascon to Commissioner Marshall\r\n\r\n  *   1st  Quarter 2010  FDRB agenda\r\n  *   1st Quarter 2011 FDRB Findings and Recommendations letter\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2004-0003 or OIS 2009-0003 or for Officer Daniel May.",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Christina Hayes (OIS 2010-0006):\r\n\r\n  *   August 4, 2010 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 9a \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n\u2022       August 2, 2010 2010 RTD letter from Chief Gascon to Commissioner Marshall\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2010-0006 Summary of Investigation\r\n\r\n  *   1st Quarter 2011 FDRB agenda\r\n  *   1st  Quarter 2011 FDRB Findings and Recommendations letter\r\n  *   Redacted transcript from 1std Quarter 2011 FDRB; specific redactions on each page of the transcript are referenced to the Police Commission\u2019s Redaction Index which is attached; the tape recording did not capture the full discussion of OIS 2010-0006).\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Christina Hayes or OIS 2010-0006.",

Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Ryan Doherty:\r\nOIS 2010-0007:\r\n\r\n  *   September 8, 2010 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 9a \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n\u2022        April 12, 2013 RTD letter from Chief Suhr to Commissioner Mazzucco\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2010-0005 Summary of Investigation\r\n\r\n  *   2nd Quarter 2011 FDRB agenda\r\n  *   2nd  Quarter 2011 FDRB Findings and Recommendations letter\r\n  *   Redacted transcript from 2nd  Quarter 2011 FDRB; specific redactions on each page of the transcript are referenced to the Police Commission\u2019s Redaction Index which is attached.\r\n\r\nOIS 2013-0005:\r\n\r\n\u2022          April 24, 2013 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 6b \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.

Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer William Heppler (OIS 2011-0006):\r\n\r\n  *   October 12, 2011 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 5b \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n\u2022        October 11, 2011 RTD letter from Chief Suhr to Commissioner Mazzucco\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2011-0006 Summary of Investigation\r\n\r\n  *   4th Quarter 2013 FDRB agenda\r\n  *   4th Quarter 2013 FDRB Findings and Recommendations letter\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer William Heppler or for OIS 2011-0006.",

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nSgt.

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 9, 2020 2020 the Commission provided you records for Officer Chad Campos and advised you that it had no additional responsive records.  Subsequent to the notification, the Commission identified the following responsive record for Officer Campos.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records:\r\nOfficer Dennis Cravalho  (OID 2007-0006):\r\n\r\n  *   1st Quarter 2007 FDRB agenda\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OID 2007-0006. The Commission will continue to search its records to determine if there are additional responsive records for Officer Dennis Cravalho.",

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Alberto Esparza (OIS 2009-0005):\r\n\r\n  *   October 21, 2009 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 8a \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether to return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n\u2022        October 13, 2009 RTD letter from Chief Gascon to Commissioner Marshall\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2009-0005 Summary of Investigation\r\n\r\n  *   2nd Quarter 2010 FDRB agenda\r\n  *   2nd Quarter 2010 FDRB Findings and Recommendations letter\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Alberto Esparza for OIS 20009-0005.",

        "communication": "San Francisco, CA\r\n\r\nRE: Public Records Request, dated February 22, 2020, Reference # P011115-022420\r\n\r\nDear :\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Police Commission (\"Commission\") received your request, dated February 22, 2020.\r\n\r\nYou requested, \"February 22, 2020\r\n\r\nPolice Commission:\r\n\r\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX. Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Wayne Wong (OIS 2013-0009)\r\n\r\n  *   January 22, 2014 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 8a \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Howard Brown (OIS 2013-0003)\r\n\r\n  *   March 27, 2013 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 7a \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n\u2022    March 22, 2013 RTD letter from Chief Suhr to Commissioner Mazzucco\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2013-0003 Summary of Investigation\r\n\r\n  *   2nd Quarter 2016 FDRB agenda\r\n  *   Redacted transcript from 2nd Quarter 2016; specific redactions on each page of the transcript are referenced to the Police Commission\u2019s Redaction Index which is attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Howard Brown or for OIS 2013-0003.\r\n\r\nOfficer Brandon Thompson  (OIS 2014-0002)\r\n\r\n  *   February 12, 2014 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 7a \u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.

Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nSgt. Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n\r\n  *   Commission record of DPA 0252-16 IAD 16-0002 joint filing decision - redactions made pursuant to attached Commission redaction code\r\n  *   Commission record of DPA 0252-16 IAD 16-0002 scheduling letter - redactions made pursuant to attached Commission redaction code\r\n  *   Commission record of DPA opposition to Sgt. Erb's motion to exclude SME Gennaco - redactions made pursuant to attached  Commission redaction code\r\n  *   Commission record of Erb 1\r\n  *   Commission record of Erb joint filing MLH DPA\r\n  *   Commission record of ERB join prehearing statement MLH TRT final 082819 - redactions made pursuant to Commission redaction code\r\n\r\nThe Commission will continue to review its records to determine if there are additional responsive records for Sgt. Justin Erb and OIS 2016-0002.",

Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nSgt. Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n\r\n*             Commission record of response re Combined Joint Filing\r\n*             Commission record of Ruling on Motion DPA 0252-16 IAD 16-002, redacted per Police Commission redaction index\r\n*             Commission record of ruling on motion to exclude expert\r\n*             Commission record of scheduling letter for hearing on 091819\r\n*             Commission record of transcripts 050819, redacted per Police Commission redaction index\r\n*             Commission record of transcripts 091819, redacted per Police Commission redaction index\r\n*             Commission record of transcripts condensed 080819, redacted per Police Commission redaction index\r\n\r\nThe Commission will continue to review its records to determine if there are additional responsive records for Sgt. Justin Erb and OIS 2016-0002.",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt.

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nSgt. Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Commission record of res 18-77 DPA 0252-16 IAD 16-002, redacted per Police Commission redaction index\r\n  *   Commission record of res 19-60 DPA 0252-16 IAD 16-002, redacted per Police Commission redaction index\r\n\r\nThe Commission will continue to review its records to determine if there are additional responsive records for Sgt. Justin Erb and OIS 2016-0002.",

Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission previously provided you with responsive records for the following incidents/officers:\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2016-0003, Officer Chew and Officer Dominguez\r\n  *   OIS 2017-0003, Officer Cha\r\n  *   OIS 2017-0004, Officer Thompson\r\nSubsequent to providing you with all the records it had relating to those incidents/officers, the Commission received additional records and we are providing them to you now.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

        "communication": "Dear :\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Police Commission (\"Commission\") received your request, dated February 22, 2020.\r\n\r\nYou requested, \"February 22, 2020\r\n\r\nPolice Commission:\r\n\r\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX. Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\nOfficer George Perez (OIS 2004-0009):\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2004-0009 OIS summary of investigations\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2014-0006 or Officer George Perez.\r\n\r\nOfficer Patrick Zapponi (OIS 2004-0010):\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2004- 0010 OIS summary of investigations\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2004-0010  or for Officer Patrick Zapponi.\r\n\r\nOfficers Brian Schaffer (OIS 2005-0002):\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2005-0002 OIS summary of investigations\r\n\r\nOfficer Brian Schaffer and Officer James Trail (OIS 2002-0005):\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2002-0005 OIS Summary of Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2005-0002 or OIS 2002-0005 or for Officer Brian Schaffer\r\n\r\nOfficer James Trail (OIS 2004-0004):\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2004-0004 OIS Summary of Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2004-0004 or for Officer James Trail\r\n\r\nOfficer Matthew Goodin, Officer Andrew Meehan and Officer Gerald Newbeck (OIS 2005-0003)\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2005-0003 Summary of Investigation\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for OIS 2005-0003 or for Officers Andrew Meehan, Matthew Goodin or Gerald Newbeck\r\nOfficer Noel DeLeon (OIS 2005-0004)\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2005-0004 Summary of Invesitgation\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2005-0004 or for Officer DeLeon.",

        "communication": "San Francisco, CA\r\n\r\nRE: Public Records Request, dated February 22, 2020, Reference # P011115-022420\r\n\r\nDear :\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Police Commission (\"Commission\") received your request, dated February 22, 2020.\r\n\r\nYou requested, \"February 22, 2020\r\n\r\nPolice Commission:\r\n\r\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX. Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\nOfficer Eduard Ochoa (OIS 2014-0007):\r\n\r\n  *   December 1, 2014 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 8b- Chief's performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer's personnel record.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\nOn September 28, 2020 the Commission provided you records for OID 2006-0007 and Officer Michael Kawaguichi.  The Commission office has determined that Officer Stephen Bucy was also involved in that incident.  There are no additional documents for OID 2006-0007; I am simply attaching the same document I provide you on September 28, 2020.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for Officer Stephen Bucy.\r\nSorry for the confusion.",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nSgt. Thomas Maguire and Sgt. Michael Tursi (OIS 2015-0004):\r\n\r\n  *   March 25, 2015 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 7a\u2013 Chief\u2019s performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not to return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer\u2019s personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022   March 24, 2015 RTD letter from Chief Suhr to Commissioner Loftus\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2015-0004 summary of investigations\r\n  *   Redacted transcript from 2nd Quarter, 2018 FDRB, Session 2 \u2013 specific redactions on each page of the transcript are referenced to the Police Commission\u2019s Redaction Index which is attached\r\n  *   2nd Quarter 2018 FDRB findings\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2015-0004 or for Sgt.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Michael Mellone and Sgt. Nathaniel Steger (OIS 2016-0001)\r\n\r\n  *   April 20, 2016 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 8b- Chief's performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not to return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer's personnel record.  Those records may be releasable through the Pitchess process.\r\n\r\n*   OIS 2016-0001 summary of investigations\r\n\r\n*         1st Q 2019 FDRB agenda\r\n\r\n  *   Redacted transcript from 1st Quarter, 2019 FDRB,  - specific redactions on each page of the transcript are referenced to the Police Commission's Redaction Index which is attached\r\n  *   1st Quarter 2019 FDRB findings\r\n  *   1st and 2nd Quarter 2019 FDRB findings\r\n\r\nThe Commission will continue to search its records to determine if additional responsive record exist for OIS 2016-0001 or for Officer Mellone or Sgt. Steger.\r\n\r\nOfficers Gregory Buhagiar, Christopher Cotter, Glennon Griffin, Matthew Nazar, Steven Oesterich, Anthony Sharron and Robby Willkom (OIS 2018-0001):\r\n\r\n  *   March 14, 2018 Police Commission public agenda which includes closed session item 3d- Chief's performance evaluation of their decision on whether or not to return the officer to duty following an Officer Involved Shooting.\r\n\r\nPer CA Penal Code section 832.7(a). the Commission is declining to release the audio recording and the additional documents related to the closed session items as they relate to an uninvolved officer's personnel record.

Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Michael Mellone and Sgt.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Samuel Fung (OIS 2017-0006))\r\n\r\n  *   3rd Q 2019 FDRB agenda\r\n\r\n  *   Redacted transcript from 3rd Quarter, 2019 FDRB,  - specific redactions on each page of the transcript are referenced to the Police Commission's Redaction Index which is attached\r\n  *   Field Tactics Force Options report on OIS 2017-0006 - specific redactions on each page of the report are referenced to the Police Commission's Redaction Index which is attached\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for OIS 2017-0006 or for Officer Samuel Fung.",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nOn December 14, 2020 the Commission provided you records for the following:\r\nOfficer Kohl O'Keefe (OIS 2013-0001)\r\nSgt. Kevin Rightmire and Officer Edric Talusan (OIS 2013-0002)\r\nSubsequent to December 14, 2020, the Commission determined that there were two transcripts for the 4th Quarter FDRB - part one and part two.  The redacted transcript for part 1 of the 4th Quarter 2014 FRDB was provided to you on December 14, 2020.  The Commission is providing you with a redacted transcript for part 2 of the 4th Quarter 2014 FDRB, with the specific redactions on each page referenced to the Police Commission's Redaction Index which is attached.  This record is applicable to both cases and officers.  The Commission apologizes for any confusion this may have caused.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Sgt. Kevin Rightmire, Officer Edric Talusan or for OIS 2013-0002, or for Officer Kohl O'Keefe or OIS 2013-0001.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficers Tracy Boes, Kirk Edison, Vincent Etcheber, Carl Fabbri, Martin Halloran, Martin Lalor, and David Nastari (OIS 2002-0003):\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2002-0003 summary of investigations\r\nThe attached document contains an error in the number of the Officer Involved Shooting.  It erroneously states the number for this OIS is 2002-0004.  The correct number in the Police Commission's records is OIS 2002-0003, which pertains to the OIS on February 27, 2002 and the above listed officers.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2002-0003 or for Officers Boes, Edison, Etcheber, Fabbri, Halloran, Lalor and Nastari.",

Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer John Ferrando (OIS 2003-0003):\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2003-0003 summary of investigations\r\nThe attached document uses an old numbering system for the number of the Officer Involved Shooting.

Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Nicholas Rainsford (OIS 2004-0001)\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2004-0001 summary of investigations\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2004-0001 or for Officer Rainsford.",

In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Eric Vintero (OIS 2002-0006)\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2002-0006 summary of investigations\r\n\r\nThe document has this case listed as OIS 007-0. However, the Commission's records for the OIS incident involving Officer Eric Vintero on June 14, 2002 is OIS 2002-0006.\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2002-0006 or for Officer Vintero.",

Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Daniel Leydon (OIS 2001-0005)\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2001-0005 summary of investigations\r\n\r\nThe document has this case listed as OIS-MCD 001-02. However, the Commission's records for the OIS incident involving Officer Leydon on December 23, 2001 is OIS 2001-0004.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2001-0005 or for Officer Leydon.",

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Stan Williams (OIS 2002-0008)\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2002-0008 summary of investigations\r\n\r\nThe document has this case listed as OIS 009-02.

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficers Joseph Juarez and Steven Maionchi (OIS 2000-0003)\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2000-0003 summary of investigations\r\n\r\nThe document has this case listed as OIS 002-00. However, the Commission's records for the OIS incident involving Officers Joseph Juarez and Steven Maionchi on October 17, 2000 are filed under OIS 2000-0003.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2000-0003 or for Offices Juarez and Maionchi.",

The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Daniel Greely (OIS-MCD 1998-0008)\r\n\r\n  *   OIS-MCD 1998-0008 summary of investigations\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS-MCD 1998-0008 or for Officer Daniel Greely.",

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficers Benito Manning, John Lewis and Brian Canedo (OIS-MCD 1998-0011)\r\n\r\n  *   OIS-MCD 1998-0011 summary of investigations\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS-MCD 1998-0011 or for Officers Manning, Lewis or Canedo.",

Erb's Motion to Exclude SME Gennanco, redactions made per attached Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n</li><li>    DPA 0252-16 IAD 16-002 combined joint filing decision, redactions made per attached Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n</li><li>    Joint Prehearing Statement MLH TRT final 082819, redactions made per attached Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Commission has additional records for Sgt. Justin Erb and OIS 2016-0002 that it must review to determine whether what information, if any, required redaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty also to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than December 22, 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Rachael Kilshaw</p>\r\n<p>San Francisco Police Department</p>\r\n<p>Police Commission Office</p>\r\n<p>1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor</p>\r\n<p>San Francisco, California 94158</p>",

        "communication": "San Francisco, CA\r\n\r\nRE: Public Records Request, dated February 22, 2020, Reference # P011115-022420\r\n\r\nDear :\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Police Commission (\"Commission\") received your request, dated February 22, 2020.\r\n\r\nYou requested, \"February 22, 2020\r\n\r\nPolice Commission:\r\n\r\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX. Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Sgt. Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n\r\n  *   DPA Opposition to Sgt. Erb's Motion to Exclude SME Gennanco, redactions made per attached Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   DPA 0252-16 IAD 16-002 combined joint filing decision, redactions made per attached Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Joint Prehearing Statement MLH TRT final 082819, redactions made per attached Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional records for Sgt.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Sgt. Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n\r\n  *   Settlement agreement re dispo of pending charges 09182019, redactions made per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Settlement agreement re dispo of pending charges 05082019\r\n  *   Commission notification letter to Erb, redactions made per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   PowerPoint for Erb hearing, redactions made per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional records for Sgt. Justin Erb and OIS 2016-0002 that it must review to determine what information, if any, requires redaction.\r\n\r\nYou have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty also to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than December 22, 2021.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Sgt. Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n\r\n  *   Erb scheduling documents, redacted per the attached Police Commission redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional documents related to Sgt. Erb and OIS 2016-0002 that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nYou have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty also to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than January 5, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Sgt. Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n\r\n  *   Deposition of witness in Erb case, redacted per the attached Police Commission redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional documents related to Sgt. Erb and OIS 2016-0002 that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nYou have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty also to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than January 19, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

        "communication": "Dear Anonymous:\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission is in receipt of your Supervisor of Records petition.  We address each of the issues you raise below.\r\n\r\nRedaction of Police Officer's name\r\n\r\nThe first issue you raise is the redaction of an officer's name.  You stated the following:\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2021/12/08/Police_Commission_copy_of_Commission_notification_letter_to_Erb_Redacted.pdf<https://avanan.url-protection.com/v1/url?o=https%3A//cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2021/12/08/Police_Commission_copy_of_Commission_notification_letter_to_Erb_Redacted.pdf&g=Y2E0MzhiODRlZmQ2NmFlYw==&h=NGRmNzdhZDg2ZDU0YjEyNTA3MjZkNmQ1ZjMwZmExMWQyNzQ4NmYxNzgwODQ3ZjdlNTQ0ODUwMDgzNDc5YmU0Yw==&p=YXAzOnNmZHQyOmF2YW5hbjpvOjRjYjA2NjdmMWJiZGFhNjVjYTk4MTgxMGQxNzZkZmRiOnYxOmg=> , what Police Commission refers to as redaction type 1 Penal Code 832.7(b)(5)(A) is being used to withhold oddly enough Sgt. Erb's name, even though (b)(5)(A) specifically cannot exempt the names of peace officers.\r\n\r\nI challenge all uses of redaction type 1 to withhold the names of peace officers in all of the records provided to me on this request.\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed our production of these documents.  The documents labeled \"Police Commission copy of record of Erb Charges_Redacted\" and \"Police Commission copy of Commission notification letter to Erb_redacted\" provided to you on December 8, 2021 inadvertently redacted Sgt. Erb's name.  We have provided you updated versions of the documents and have only redact Sgt. Erb's address, which is allowable under California Penal Code 832.7(b)(5)(A) and what we originally intended.  Please refer to the attached Police Commission Redaction Index Code #1. Thank you for bringing this error to the Police Commission's attention.\r\n\r\nCLETS and CORI Redactions\r\n\r\nYou challenge the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System \"CLETS\" and Local Summary Criminal History \"CORI\" redactions.  You state:\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission has stated the following written justification and redaction key for various withholdings for SB 1421 records:\r\nRedaction type 7 - \"California Penal Code \u00a7 11105 et. seq. - CORI data (personal identifiable criminal history) and CLETS data (California Law Enforcement Telecommunications Systems).\"\r\n\r\nAdmin Code 67.26 requires that each redaction be keyed to a justification under 67.27. But this is not a lawful 67.27 justification because it is neither citing a \"specific permissive exemption\" nor a \"specific statutory authority.\"\r\n\r\n\"California Penal Code \u00a7 11105 et. seq\" refers to dozens of different clauses.  The Police Commission must take a specific position on which of these various distinct statutory authories apply.  Which clause specifically purportedly exempts this information?\r\n\r\nMoreover, this redaction justification seems to be abused: For example, photographs of cars in the Erb incident cannot possibly be derived from CLETS or CORI.  They are from the incident at hand.    https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2021/12/08/Police_Commission_copy_of_PowerPoint_for_Erb_hearing_Redacted.pdf<https://avanan.url-protection.com/v1/url?o=https%3A//cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2021/12/08/Police_Commission_copy_of_PowerPoint_for_Erb_hearing_Redacted.pdf&g=NGRkZDUwOTc5NzI3NTM2NA==&h=MzRhZWIyZjdjY2IzODFlODNmYjk0ZTE3OGI5MTMzOGJjMTFmZWFjNjdkNWIzMzg3NGI0MzFkY2U4NTFhMjkxOA==&p=YXAzOnNmZHQyOmF2YW5hbjpvOjRjYjA2NjdmMWJiZGFhNjVjYTk4MTgxMGQxNzZkZmRiOnYxOmg=>\r\n\r\nWe agree that we should be more precise in our rationale as to why you are not entitled to receive CLETS or CORI information. We have revised our redaction code.\r\n\r\nNext, you challenge the redaction to the \"Hot Sheet. The \"hot sheet\" is information that was obtained from CLETS.  The Police Commission is bound to comply with the State's regulations concerning individuals' criminal history. California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System Policies, Practices and Procedures and Statutes Section 1.4.2., CLETs statute. Cal. Penal Code section 11105(a)(1) states \"The Department of Justice shall maintain state summary criminal history information.\"  Cal. Penal Code section 11105(b) sets forth entities and individuals who may obtain the information.  Under the and California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System Policies, Practices and Procedures and Statutes, Section 1.6.4, Confidentiality of Information from the CLETS - Only authorized law enforcement, criminal justice personnel or their lawfully authorized designees may use a CLETS terminal or have access to information derived from CLETS. Any information from the CLETS is confidential and for official use only.  https://oag.ca.gov/sites/default/files/clets-ppp%2012-2019.pdf\r\n\r\nYou are not authorized under the statute to obtain the information.  We are unable to provide you with the information you seek.  But, the Hotsheet was properly withheld under California Penal Code section 11105(b) and the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System Policies, Practices and Procedures Section 1.6.4, Confidentiality of Information from the CLETS for all the reasons stated above. We have revised our redaction code to be more precise in our redactions. Thank you for bringing this to the Police Commission's attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense Plate\r\n\r\nLastly, you challenge the redactions to the document labeled \"Police Commission copy of PowerPoint for Erb hearing_Redacted.\" Page #19 of the PowerPoint was properly redacted, but the justification was incorrect.  The license plate on this page was redacted under California Government Code section 6254 (c) and 6254(k) and under the right of privacy under Article I. sec. 1 of the California Constitution.  We have also updated our redaction code.  As for the redactions on pages 15, 16, 17, 21 the license plate numbers on the photos are illegible and therefore no redactions are needed.  Thank you for bringing this to the Commission's attention.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n\r\n  *   Joint Prehearing Statement from Hinckley and Thompson with exhibits (part 1)\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional documents related to Sgt. Erb and OIS 2016-0002 that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nYou have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty also to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than February 4, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Sgt. Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n\r\n  *   Joint Prehearing Statement from Hinckley and Thompson with exhibits (part 2), redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional documents related to Sgt. Erb and OIS 2016-0002 that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nYou have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.

        "communication": "San Francisco, CA\r\n\r\nRE: Public Records Request, dated February 22, 2020, Reference # P011115-022420\r\n\r\nDear :\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Police Commission (\"Commission\") received your request, dated February 22, 2020.\r\n\r\nYou requested, \"February 22, 2020\r\n\r\nPolice Commission:\r\n\r\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX. Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Sgt. Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n\r\n  *   Joint Prehearing Statement from Hinckley and Thompson with exhibits (part 4A), redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional documents related to Sgt. Erb and OIS 2016-0002 that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nYou have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty also to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than March 4, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Sgt. Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n\r\n  *   Joint Prehearing Statement from Hinckley and Thompson with exhibits (part 4C), redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional documents related to Sgt. Erb and OIS 2016-0002 that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nYou have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty also to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than March 18, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty also to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than March 18, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Sgt. Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n\r\n  *   Joint Prehearing Statement from Hinckley and Thompson with exhibits (part 4F), redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional documents related to Sgt. Erb and OIS 2016-0002 that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nYou have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty also to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.

The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Sgt. Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n*         Joint Prehearing Statement from Hinckley and Thompson Part 4G - redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional documents related to Sgt. Erb and OIS 2016-0002 that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nYou have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than April 1, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Sgt. Justin Erb (OIS 2016-0002):\r\n*         Joint Prehearing Statement from Hinckley and Thompson Part 4I- redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional documents related to Sgt. Erb and OIS 2016-0002 that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nYou have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than April 1, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record.

Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Officer Paulo Morgado, Case No. IVF C09-143\r\n\r\n  *   Morgado IVF C09-143, Part 1, redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index.\r\n  *   Morgado IVF C09-143, Part 1a, missing pages, redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Morgado IVF C09-143, Part 2, redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional documents related to Officer Paulo Morgado that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than May 6, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

        "communication": "San Francisco, CA\r\n\r\nRE: Public Records Request, dated February 22, 2020, Reference # P011115-022420\r\n\r\nDear :\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Police Commission (\"Commission\") received your request, dated February 22, 2020.\r\n\r\nYou requested, \"February 22, 2020\r\n\r\nPolice Commission:\r\n\r\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX. Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Officers Jason Gallagher:\r\n\r\n  *   Gallagher Case No C08-170, redacted per the attached Police Commission Redaction Index Code\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Jason Gallagher.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than May 20, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \u201ccatchall exemption\u201d of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Officer Nicole Gilliam (MCD-2015-0003-ICD)\r\n\r\nFDRB 2nd Q 2021\r\nFDRB 1st Q 2021\r\nFDRB 3rd Q 2020\r\nFDRB 3rd Q 2021\r\nAug 19, 2015 Police Commission agenda\r\nMCD-2015-0003-ICD, return to duty letter, redacted per attached Commission redaction index\r\n4th Q 2020 FDRB\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Gilliam.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission\u2019s possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 \u2013 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney\u2019s website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department\u2019s performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission\u2019s other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than May June 3, 2022.            \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\n\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\n\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n\r\n1245 \u2013 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158\r\n\r\n415.575.5852  phone\r\n\r\nrachael.kilshaw@sfgov.org\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE:  This communication and its contents may contain confidential and/or legally privileged information.

Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Officer Paulo Morgado, Case No. IVF C09-143\r\n\r\n  *   Morgado IVF C09-143, Part 5, redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index.\r\n  *   Morgado IVF C09-143, Part 6, redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional documents related to Officer Paulo Morgado that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than June 3, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record.

Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Officer Paulo Morgado, Case No. IVF C09-143\r\n\r\n  *   Morgado IVF C09-143, Part 9, redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index.\r\n  *   Morgado IVF C09-143, Part 10, redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Morgado IVF C09-143, Part 11, redacted per the attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional items related to Officer Paulo Morgado that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by SB 1421, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than July 1, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation.

Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2.

As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than July 1, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Officer Jason Lai (ALW IAD 2015-0248)\r\n\r\n  *   ALW IAD 2015-0248 Jason Lai specification, redactions made per Police Commission redaction index\r\n  *   Lai documents ALW IAD 2015-0248, redactions made per Police Commission redaction index\r\n  *   Department pretrial statement ALW IAD 2015-0248, redaction made per Police Commission redaction index\r\n  *   Jason Lai pretrial statement ALW IAD 2015-0248, redactions made per Police Commission redaction index\r\n  *   Lai scheduling letter 02292016, redactions made per Police Commission redaction index\r\n  *   Email re Jason Lai resignation\r\n  *   Email re Jason Lai restrictions on future employment\r\n  *   Jason Lai notification ALW IAD 2015-0248, redactions made per Police Commission redaction index\r\n  *   Police Commission resolution 16-29, Jason Lai resignation, redactions made per Police Commission redaction index.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Jason Lai.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than July 1, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Officer Joseph Reyes (IAD 2015-0338)\r\n\r\n  *   Department Prehearing statement, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Letter of thanks and related documents, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Resolution 16-27 assignment, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Resolution 17-15 Reyes final dispo, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Resolution 17-30 adoption of findings, redaction per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Reyes notification, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Reyes notification letter, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Reyes appeal offer, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Reyes Finding of Facts, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Reyes 012417 transcripts, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Reyes 03012017 transcripts, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Reyes 122116 transcripts, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Reyes IAD 2015-0338 case documents, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Reyes Settlement Agreement, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Reyes Specifications IAD 2015-0338\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional records for Officer Joseph Reyes that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than July 15, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Officer Courtney Smith (ALW-IAD 2013-0216)\r\n\r\n  *   Resolution 17-31 ALW IAD 2013-0216, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Courtney Smith 040616 notification, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Courtney Smith ALW IAD 2013-0216 specifications, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Courtney Smith ALW IAD 2013-0216 040616 transcripts, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Courtney Smith Nov 4 2015 notification, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Courtney Smith Oct 7 2015 notification, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Courtney Smith ALW IAD 2013-0216 scheduling letter, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Courtney Smith report for the Commission, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Courtney Smith ALW IAD 2013-0216 res 14-46 assignment, redacted per attached Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has additional records for Officer Courtney Smith that it must review to determine if redactions are needed prior to releasing them.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than July 25, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Officer Julian Ng (OIS 2000-0001)\r\n\r\n  *   OIS 2000-0001 summary of investigation\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for OIS 2000-0001 or for Officer Julian Ng.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than August 15, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than September 16,  2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Officer Joseph Reyes IAD 2015-0338:\r\n\r\n  *   Joseph Reyes Administrative Appeal 2 of 3, redacted pursuant to attached redaction index\r\n\r\n The Commission has additional records for Officer Reyes which must be review to determine if redactions are needed.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records related to your request for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than September 16,  2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than September 30, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Officer Joseph Reyes IAD 2015-0338:\r\n\r\n  *   Reyes Defense Video #2 and Reyes Defense Video #3, redacted per the attached Police Commission Redaction Index and video redaction notes: https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.mycusthelp.com/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(eccv4z3zozuaolluz2znedx0))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549SQISZWXGGKKDYNKQVUGKEFNNHXURSE&rid=75939&view=45\r\n  *   Reyes Defense Video #4: https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.mycusthelp.com/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(eccv4z3zozuaolluz2znedx0))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549SQISZWXGGKKDYNKQVUGKEFNNHXURSE&rid=75939&view=45\r\n  *   Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Video redaction notes\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Joseph Reyes or case IAD 2015-0338.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records related to your request for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.

Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the following responsive records for Sgt Sherry Hicks (IAD 2017-0283)\r\n\r\n  *   Hicks IAD 2017-0293 part 2 of 3, redacted per the attached redaction index\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission has additional records for Sgt. Sherry Hicks which it must review prior to release to determine if any redactions are needed.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records related to your request for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than November 25, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 12, 2021 the Police Commission provided you responsive records related to Officer James O'Malley and OIS 2004-0005 and advised there wer no additional responsive records for wither the officer or the incident.  Subsequent to March 8, 2021, the Police Commission has determined there are additional records related to Officer O'Malley and OIS 2004-0005.  The Commission is providing you those additional responsive records now:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   J O'Malley OIS 2004-0005 and C06-218 case file, redacted per the attached Police Commission redaction index\r\n\r\n\r\n The Commission has no additional records for Officer James O'Malley or for OIS 2004-0005.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records related to your request for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than November 25, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock).

In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission is providing you with the following records for Officer Sean Doherty:\r\n\r\n  *   Sean Doherty case file IAD 2015-0087, redacted\r\n  *   Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Sean Doherty or for IAD 2015-0087\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records related to your request for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than December 16, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission is providing you with the following responsive records for Officer Richard Hastings:\r\n\r\n  *   Officer Richard Hastings IAD 2013-0194 casefile, redacted\r\n  *   Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Richard Hastings or for case IAD 2013-0194.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records related to your request for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than January 27, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission is providing you with the following responsive records for Officer Gary Moriyama:\r\n\r\n  *   Officer Gary Moriyama case file IVF C11-023, redacted per attached Redaction Index\r\n  *   Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for case file IVF C11-023 or for Officer Gary Moriyama.\r\n\r\nOn January 27, 2023, the Commission provided you records related to Sgt. Reese Burrows and advised you it needed to determine if there were additional responsive records for Sgt. Reese Burrows.  The Commission determined it has no additional responsive records for Sgt. Burrows related to your request.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records related to your request for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than April 7, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nOn July 11, 2022 the Police Commission provided you records for Officer Courtney Smith and case ALW IAD 2013-0216 and advised it had additional records it need to review for possible redactions.  The Commission is providing the following records for Officer Courtney Smith and case numbers ALW IAD 2013-0216 and ALW IAD 2014-0097:\r\n\r\n  *   Courtney Smith case file documents ALW IAD 2013-0216, redacted per attached Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Courtney Smith Feb 4 2015 transcript, redacted per attached Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Smith Stipulated Agreement November 24, 2014, redacted per attached Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Smith Stipulated Agreement Sept 29, 2015, redacted per attached Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n  *   Smith amended specifications ALW IAD 2013-0216 and ALW IAD 2014-0097, redacted per attached Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for Officer Courtney Smith, for ALW IAD 2013-0216 or for ALW IAD 2014-0097.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records related to your request for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than April 7, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

Subsequently, the Commission has located additional records for OIS 2005-0004 and additional records for officers involved in that incident.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission is providing you with the following responsive records for Officer Ferdinand Dimapasoc and Officer Owen Sweeney:\r\n\r\n  *   Ferdinand Dimapasoc C06-217 case file, redacted per attached Redaction Index\r\n  *   Owen Sweeny C06-220 case file, redacted per attached Redaction Index\r\n  *   Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nThe Commission will continue to search to determine if there are additional records for OIS 2004-0005 or records for Officers James O'Malley, Timothy Paine, Ferdinand Dimapasoc, Owen Sweeney, or any additional officers.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records related to your request for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release.

Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission is providing you with a link to the following responsive records for Officers James O'Malley, Timothy Paine, Ferdinand Dimapasoc and Owen Sweeney:\r\n\r\n  *   O'Malley, Paine, Dimapasoc, Sweeney case file part 1, redacted\r\n  *   O'Malley, Paine, Dimapasoc, Sweeney case file part 2, redacted\r\n  *   Police Commission Redaction Index\r\n\r\nhttps://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(z1oj3r0mh1urnljg434uxtro))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549MWUW[YKPZAHZKHVEDLJUVUNQHP[XMR&rid=44574&view=45<https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(z1oj3r0mh1urnljg434uxtro))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549MWUW%5bYKPZAHZKHVEDLJUVUNQHP%5bXMR&rid=44574&view=45>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for OIS 2004-0005 or records for Officers James O'Malley, Timothy Paine, Ferdinand Dimapasoc, Owen Sweeney.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records related to your request for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than May 26, 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you a link to the following releasable records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Peter Ma JWA C00-296:  https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(teyp4331xqyooddigb3xxqp3))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549AEIWRDJUCIVWDCMOPWHIWWEJJMTU[Y&rid=127135&view=45<https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(teyp4331xqyooddigb3xxqp3))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549AEIWRDJUCIVWDCMOPWHIWWEJJMTU%5bY&rid=127135&view=45>\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for case #JWA C00-296 or for Officer Peter Ma.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records related to your request for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with an update no later than October 13, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you a link to the following releasable records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Laurence Barker JWA C02-128   https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(z1ge1snjliw4bslpwf4tb4gw))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=133167&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Laurence Barker or for JWA C02-128\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records related to your request for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by PC section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed, and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with an update no later than December 1, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the link to the following responsive records: Officer Renaldo Vargas case # EGF C03-302; use of force causing great bodily injury or death:  https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(erbeoiuunbi4ufjnm5x1tv2k))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549ZYVYGEJWIDXVKZBIRYLNLSE[LGRSEB&rid=133141&view=45<https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(erbeoiuunbi4ufjnm5x1tv2k))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549ZYVYGEJWIDXVKZBIRYLNLSE%5bLGRSEB&rid=133141&view=45>\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Reynaldo Vargas or for case # EGF C03-302.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than January 1, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you the link to the following responsive records for Officer Michael Maxwell case # JWA C04-096:  https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(ldeyb31folpahbizfyvqlqeq))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=136789&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Michael Maxwell or for JWA C04-096.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than January 1, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you a link to the following responsive records for Officer Thomas Samiere:  https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(3keiid503qe3r4g2lqyegij5))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=139591&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for Officer Thomas Samiere or for JWA C02-346.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than January 21, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission previously provided you records for the shooting of a firearm of a person: OIS 2004-0006 and advised you there were no additional records for the involved officers or the OIS.  Subsequently, the Commission Office located additional responsive records for OIS 2004-0006.  The Commission is providing you the following link where the additional records are posted online:  https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(opa4owdrdrhhskraoxndxhae))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=1095075JSUYBQMRBMDHDXSDZWKNAVRCNCJLOZZNJ&rid=44823&view=45\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are no additional records for the involved officers of for OIS 2004-0006.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than February 3, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

        "communication": "San Francisco, CA\r\n\r\nRE: Public Records Request, dated February 22, 2020, Reference # P011115-022420\r\n\r\nDear :\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Police Commission (\"Commission\") received your request, dated February 22, 2020.\r\n\r\nYou requested, \"February 22, 2020\r\n\r\nPolice Commission:\r\n\r\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX. Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you a link to the following responsive records for Officer William Taylor:  https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(015jksgu3pm2c4xgeortg0tk))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=146535&view=45\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for case #JWA C96-147 & 97-274 or for Officer William Taylor.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than March 27, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you a link to the following responsive records for Officer Francis Hogue: https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(txf5xz5or2bcwv11l2av5nns))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=146563&view=45\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for case #RLC C34-182 & C96-154 or for Officer Francisc Hogue.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than March 27, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than March 27, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you a link to the following responsive records for Officer Philip Fee: https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(lqlsxwtszraz1b5nsmsoetdr))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=147089&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for case #RLC C45-239 or for Officer Philip Fee.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.

The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you a link to the following responsive records:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Officer Charles Wilkerson:  https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(rmcfr3g3y1l0j4x0c1kwk3us))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549:3243YYZVBGURSANBSXMXQIKBRLMNQ&rid=159324&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for case # JWA C34-189 or for Officer Wilkerson.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Officer Robert Tayac: https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(0lxex0igf31ywz4hxambnqrw))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549:35832WNTDZYOUWLDADIQWRLOQMSUK&rid=159188&view=45\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for JWA C96-179 or for Officer Tayac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Officer Sharon Bissell: https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(1ziwds52bhrt3a4vpokqvloi))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=159322&view=45\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for case # JWA C23-159/C34021 or for Officer Sharon Bissell.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than September 2, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you a link to the following responsive records:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Officer Emily Fields:  https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(t1g4kvqvzt4ua4yqn5vohi2d))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549:40076XUVLTPQGOFMPHFLU[ZNNIAKR&rid=160992&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for case number JWA C12-051 or for Officer Fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Officer Vincent Vago:  https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(oxv3zwkd3ogfyyfi4uf5is5u))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549:38313DRSROHIGOL[OOZCKBQTJXGZY&rid=161016&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for case number JWA C12-080 or for Officer Vago.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Sgt. Frank McDonagh:  https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(tccffu1kezl41lpvv0hddwqx))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549:10178JXKIMNEWSPFHFYXVOGBLFQXC&rid=160997&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional responsive records for case number RAM C01-090 or for Sgt. McDonagh.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than September 2, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you a link to the following responsive records:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Officer Gregory Randolph:   https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(kvd1nnvhpkgfhztbpvl2t4t5))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=165697&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for Officer Gregory Randolph or for Commission case # MEG C90-025\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Officer Henry Fikkers: https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(kvd1nnvhpkgfhztbpvl2t4t5))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=165701&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for Officer Henry Fikkers or for Commission case # MEG C90-025.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than September 2, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you a link to the following responsive records:\r\n\r\nOfficer Candice Fukunaga: https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(2hzsncn0gwqoyaaqgq0krs44))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549:20104SYIZUTUOMVVGIMYHIDBXVQVI&rid=126955&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for Officer Fukunaga or for case # JWA D01-197.\r\n\r\nOfficer Paul Penrose: https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(5wb0ngffom3v0hwlz0nolaq4))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549KERMISILUUGKZQFW[RDHRHLEUMTGJM&rid=126970&view=45<https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(5wb0ngffom3v0hwlz0nolaq4))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549KERMISILUUGKZQFW%5bRDHRHLEUMTGJM&rid=126970&view=45>\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for Officer Penrose or for case # JWA C01-064.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than December 12, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

I have included a link to all the documents related to that case: https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(p0bl4mqi3rgm5bm1ww4p1jw2))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=94642&view=45\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than December 12, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you a link to responsive records for Officer Nathan Johnson case # MEG C56-152 (Officer involved shooting): https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(bz2odcgpolgbjr4mlaqkimm2))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=180389&view=45.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has not additional responsive records for Officer Johnson or for case #MEG C56-152.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than December 12, 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you with the following responsive records for Officer Eddie Coley and  case # JWA C67-036 (Officer Involved Shooting): https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(1yb51cyob4frryr0gdx5tbjv))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=180850&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for Officer Eddie Coley or for JWA C67-036.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.

The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you with the following responsive records for Officer Robert Ribeiro and case # MEG C67-423: https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(vpy5ebihdh5opkxlepykys0v))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=181067&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for Officer Robert Ribeiro or for MEG C67-423.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than December 12, 2024.\r\n\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you with the following link to responsive records for Officer David Oberhoffer (JWA C45-103 - dishonesty): https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(vcbvofufmyjqy3mvowzqyy24))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=182612&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for Officer David Oberhoffer or for case # JWA C45-103.\r\n\r\nThe Commission continues to search for additional responsive records for your request.  You have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. As you pointed out in your request, only certain categories of records are subject to release. Unfortunately, the Commission has not maintained personnel records according to the releasable categories.  Rather, the Commission has maintained records under the names of individual officers.  This makes our search for records responsive to your request exceedingly time-consuming, as we must manually look through the personnel file of every officer covered by your request to determine if it contains responsive records.  And, in reviewing a responsive record covered by Penal Code section 832.7, we must be careful to redact information that may be confidential for other reasons, before releasing the record.\r\n\r\nComplicating this problem is that Commission has received a number of requests for previously confidential peace officer records made public as a result of the passage of SB 1421 and SB 16.  Despite our best efforts to respond promptly, a backlog has quickly developed and will remain for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Police Commission must balance its duty to respond to public records requests with its duty to perform the broad range of tasks performed by Commission personnel.  Responding to your request will be quite burdensome and time-consuming, especially when coupled with our duty to respond to like public records requests from others.  The Commission will not be able to respond within the customary time frame without unreasonably impinging on its ability to perform its other duties.\r\n\r\nIt is in this rare circumstance that we find it necessary to invoke a rule of reason to guide the timing of our response to your public records request.  As the City Attorney has stated on pages 103 - 104 of the Good Government Guide, which is available on the City Attorney's website, the law recognizes that when there is a conflict between a department's performance of its wide range of duties, and its responsibilities under public records laws, reason demands flexibility in the timing of responses to requests.  Under this rule and given the Commission's other public obligations, we will not be able to devote an unlimited amount of staff time to your request and like requests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the voluminous nature of the records that still need to be searched, reviewed and redacted to comply with your request, the Police Commission will provide the remaining responsive records to you on a rolling basis.  The Commission staff will devote two to three hours each week to work on this Public Records Act request and will provide you with the next set of responsive records no later than January 4, 2025.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records.

        "communication": "San Francisco, CA\r\n\r\nRE: Public Records Request, dated February 22, 2020, Reference # P011115-022420\r\n\r\nDear :\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Police Commission (\"Commission\") received your request, dated February 22, 2020.\r\n\r\nYou requested, \"February 22, 2020\r\n\r\nPolice Commission:\r\n\r\nNOTE: THE EMAIL ADDRESS SENDING THIS REQUEST IS A PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX. Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock). Nothing herein is legal, IT, or professional advice of any kind. The author disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to all warranties of merchantability or fitness. In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency.\r\nYour initial response is required by Feb 25, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records.\r\nExact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing by specific statutory authority (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in or Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, I want all SB 1421 records you have retained, and I want a quantity/existence/form statement, even if you believe their contents are exempt. Just like the AG in Becerra v Superior Court, if you retained any police misconduct records you must release your own copies, regardless of what SFPD/DPA do. But here's the full request:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuant to Becerra v Superior Court (First Amendment Coalition, 2020), provide all records (where \"record(s)\" is defined specifically by Penal Code 832.7(b)(2), and REGARDLESS of whether they are prepared by or for your agency or its employees) of all incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer or custodial officer; all incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public; all records relating to an incident in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence. Note: The potential exception that the State AG may have under Gov Code 6255 / public-interest balancing test, which the Court of Appeal found may apply if Becerra had asked for it, DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR OFFICE, pursuant to SFAC 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\n2. Please also provide an SFAC 67.21(c) written statement of the existence or quantity of these records in #1 (even if you believe their contents to be exempt) within 7 days (no extensions)\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nFYI - If you haven't read Becerra v Superior Court, the Court of Appeals held: \"We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that section 832.7 generally requires disclosure of all responsive records in the possession of the Department, regardless whether the records pertain to officers employed by the Department or by another public agency and regardless whether the Department or another public agency created the records. Although we also determine, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the so-called \"catchall exemption\" of the CPRA, codified at Government Code section 6255, may apply to records that are subject to disclosure under section 832.7, our independent review leads us to conclude the Department did not adequately demonstrate that the public interest served by nondisclosure of the records at issue clearly outweighs the public interest in their disclosure. \"\r\n\r\nHowever, no San Francisco agency or official can use the catchall exemption/6255 due to SF Admin Code 67.24(g and i).\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission is providing you with the following link to responsive records for the following Officers:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Officer Joseph Hession (MEG C34-185 - sexual assault): https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(omafqbg4f5hrebkxq0f5c4y5))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?rid=202170&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for Officer Hession or for case # MEG C34-185.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Officer Peter Balestreri (MEG C34-188 - sexual assault): https://sb1421publicarchive-sanfranciscopd.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(ajekmpsvtbkqco04ix3vv24z))/RequestArchiveDetails.aspx?sSessionID=2081213549:30685XHJUXIKWOIQQPAOPMYOOAMRC&rid=194007&view=45\r\n\r\nThe Commission has no additional records for Officer Peter Balestreri or for case # MEG C34-18\r\n\r\nYou have asked for all SB 1421 records in the Police Commission's possession. The Commission has searched through its records and determined there are no additional responsive records related to your request.  The Commission has provided you with all its responsive records related to your request.  The Commission has closed your request.\r\n\r\n\nRachael Kilshaw\r\nSan Francisco Police Department\r\nPolice Commission Office\r\n1245 - 3rd Street, 6th Floor\r\nSan Francisco, California 94158",

If any 911 calls exist, I request them only if they provide relevant additional details.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nI request a fee waiver as the disclosure of these records serves the public interest in transparency regarding law enforcement interactions and public disturbances, rather than for personal or commercial gain.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in digital format via email or a secure online portal if available. If any associated fees apply, please inform me before processing. If any portion of this request is denied or redacted, please cite the specific exemption under Ohio law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance. Please confirm receipt of this request at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPolice Cam News",

On November 19, 2021, I received an automatic confirmation letter from your agency, and you assigned my request tracking No. DOI-BLM-2022-000786.\r\n\r\nIt has been over a year since I submitted this FOIA request, and I have not heard anything from your agency. This period clearly exceeds the 20 days provided by the statute, and thus I deem my request denied.\r\n\r\nThe information I requested is merely a duplicate of your agency's previous response to a FOIA request, plus processing notes, and therefore is clearly \r\nreleasable under FOIA and may not validly be protected by any of the Act's exemptions. Also, it should have been a simple matter to process and fulfill this request.\r\n\r\nAs I have made this request in the capacity of a journalist, I would appreciate your expediting the consideration of my appeal in every way possible. In any case, I will expect to receive your decision within 20 business days, as required by the statute.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMaraya Cornell",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing William Boarman.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    The 5,996 pages considered potentially responsive to FOIA 1346536-000.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The remaining files requested are now available. The County of Nevada determined some of the records requested required redaction under the California Public Records Act (CPRA) for the following reasons: Responsive documents are released subject to redactions pursuant to Govt. Code sec. 7023.600 as records of investigation; Evid. Code sec 1040 official information privilege, as related to ongoing investigations, officer names for those working undercover; CCP sec. 1798.90.55(b); Govt. Code sec. 7927.705 (prohibited disclosure pursuant to state law); privacy interests under Cal. Const., Article I, section 1 and Govt Code. 7927.700; and Govt. Code sec. 7922.000, public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure so as to protect privacy interests of individuals and criminal information (i.e. reason for query, warrants, crimes associated with investigations and linked to identifiable suspects and/or victims of crime, including identity of officers working undercover). Records that are not exempt and responsive records to your request have been made available to you. Please log in to the Public Records Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive documents. SHERIFF PUBLIC RECORD REQUEST - S002695-020925  This completes your records request.

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Redex Corp. The FBI has located approximately 2948 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFOIA Negotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nNeed a status check?

However, in the unlikely case that your agency only maintains records in paper format and therefore a paper copy is appropriate, one would expect a reasonable charge of $0.05 per page (as is standard among state agencies).  If we account for $3 for postage, and double the fee to $.10 a page, that would indicate your policy is 70 pages long, which seems extraordinary.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, please provide an accounting of what the fee is for so I may assess whether this fee does not exceed the cost to you.\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nDave Maass\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis request concerns the January 29, 2025 \"MEMORANDUM FOR SENIOR PENTAGON LEADERSHIP COMMANDERS OF THE COMBATANT COMMANDS DEFENSE AGENCY AND DOD FIELD ACTIVITY DIRECTORS,\" entitled \"Restoring America's Fighting Force,\" issued by the Secretary of Defense. A copy of the memo is available at https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jan/29/2003634987/-1/-1/1/RESTORING-AMERICAS-FIGHTING-FORCE.PDF.\r\n\r\nI request a copy of the \"initial report\" by the Task Force to the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. The initial report was due on or before March 1, 2025.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.8(e)(1)(i)(B) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the Secretary's creation of a task force and the initial report by the task force.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis because it concerns the the Secretary's implementation of a presidential policy priority, and because the public's feedback on the \"initial report\" may impact the Task Force's final report, which is due on June 1, 2025. If that information is only disclosed months or years later, it will inhibit the ability of the public to understand how its current officials are making decisions.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-dod-creates-task-force-abolish-dei-offices-promote-systemic-racism\r\nb. https://www.dailywire.com/news/pentagon-guts-dei-programs-from-u-s-military\r\nc. https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5114409-pence-hegseth-military-promotions-race-sex/\r\nd. https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/01/hegseth-sets-up-pentagon-task-force-to-roll-back-diversity-programs-00201320\r\ne. https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-01-30/hegseth-dei-defense-department-promotions-academies-16654199.html\r\nf. https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2025/01/hegseth-stands-anti-dei-task-force/402623/\r\ng https://www.campusreform.org/article/hegseth-orders-end-affirmative-action-admissions-service-academies/27419\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Department itself published an article concerning the Task Force, reflecting its recognition that there is a public interest in timely information about it: https://www.defense.gov/news/news-stories/article/article/4047592/defense-secretary-directs-creation-of-task-force-to-restore-americas-fighting-f/\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.12(l), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the policies, procedures, and practices of senior Department officials concerning the Department's policies and programs.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations, as the information pertains to the policies and underlying information driving decisions by senior Department officials. Disclosing the policies and other information would demonstrate the bases for those decisions, which have attracted substantial public attention, as demonstrated by the articles cited above. That information is not in the public domain.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",
