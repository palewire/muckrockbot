It should also be determined where responsibility was illegal or could have led to the attack itself. This information is of great value to all students and parents but also to those who seek budgetary constraints on certain forms of law enforcement.\r\n\r\nThese records of agreement, payment/exchange, bid, will serve as a directory and will provide means for third parties (person/organization/business/Agency) providing any form of security to LAUSD property to be rightfully contacted for questions and to release details pertaining to  educational communities historic protections, insurance, regulations regarding liaison with Law Enforcement Agencies, whether or not that occurred before-during-after the specific event referenced here, and all violent incidents prior/ those potentially occuring today.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This request was forwarded to me, as is common, to help ensure proper handling and compliance in accordance with Alabama law and legislative policy.\r\nThe Alabama Legislature and its agencies value transparency and public access to all of its official proceedings, as is set forth in Alabama\u2019s Constitution.  Thus, we are always happy to either provide, or point out where to obtain public records for interested members of the public such as yourself.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, however, your request does not include or identify any records or documents, if any such items even exist, that would be subject to our open records laws as the type of items requested would either not be public records containing any official legislative business, or would be subject to constitutional protections and confidentialities afforded to these types of documents and communications under the Speech and Debate clauses of the federal and Alabama constitutions.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to reply back to me if you have any additional questions.\r\n\r\nIn case this is helpful to you in some way, please know that most all official legislative business can be found on the Alabama Legislature\u2019s website: http://www.legislature.state.al.us<http://www.legislature.state.al.us/>.  For example, a list of each legislator\u2019s filed bills may be found on the website as follows:  \u201cBills\u201d >> \u201cBills by House Sponsor\u201d and/or \u201cBills by Senate Sponsor\u201d >> then click on the applicable legislator and a listing of his or her bills may be accessed, including any applicable votes or amendments, and the current disposition of the bill in the legislative process.\r\n\r\nAgain, please feel free to reach out to me with any additional questions or if I may be of further assistance.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nJames L.
