        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a public records request made via MuckRock under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, seeking records related to law enforcement officer certification in this state.\r\n\r\nThis request is brought by Big Local News along with a collaboration of news organizations, including ABC News, KQED, MuckRock and other news organizations. Big Local News is a program of Stanford University\u2019s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and helps journalists collect, process and analyze public data. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking two categories of certification records:   \r\n\r\n* All certified officers \r\nAll law enforcement officers who are actively certified as of the date of this request (or when the request is processed). If your system maintains historical records of previously certified officers who are no longer active, please include them as far back as possible. If correctional officers are certified by your agency, please include them as well.  \r\n\r\n* Decertified officers\r\nAll law enforcement officers who have been decertified through revocations, voluntary surrenders, suspensions or any other actions going back as far as possible. Please include records for decertified correctional officers if available. \r\n\r\nData elements for certified officers:\r\n* Officer unique ID number \r\n* POST or state certification ID number\r\n* Officer\u2019s full name\r\n* Officer\u2019s date of birth or, if not releasable, year of birth or current age\r\n* Officer\u2019s city and/or zip code of residence\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current department or agency\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current department or agency start date\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current position and/or rank at that department or agency\r\n* Officer\u2019s previous departments/agencies (employment history), with start and end dates\r\n* Officer\u2019s positions and/or ranks at previous departments or agencies\r\n* Officer\u2019s original date of certification\r\n* Current status of certification (active, lapsed, expired, suspended, etc.)\r\n* Last action taken on certification\r\n* Date of last action on certification \r\n* Disciplinary actions taken against this officer\u2019s certification\r\n* Dates of disciplinary actions taken against this officer\u2019s certification\r\n* Training history/additional certifications of this officer, if available\r\n\r\nData elements for decertified officers: \r\n* Officer unique ID number \r\n* POST ID number\r\n* Officer\u2019s full name\r\n* Officer\u2019s date of birth or, if not releasable, year of birth or current age\r\n* Officer\u2019s city and/or zip code of residence.\r\n* Officer\u2019s last department/agency, with start and end date\r\n* Officer\u2019s last position and/or rank at that department or agency\r\n* Decertification action taken (revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, etc.)\r\n* Date decertification action taken\r\n* POST case number, if applicable\r\n* Reason for decertification or similar action\r\n\r\nIf your certification system contains data elements not listed above, please include them in the response, provided they are releasable under the law. On the other hand, we recognize some of the information we are asking for may not be tracked by your system. If that is the case, we are willing to accept as many of the data elements as your agency maintains. If some records are more readily available, we are happy to receive partial information as soon as possible while the remaining request is processed. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the data elements listed, we request documentation necessary to understand and interpret the data, including but not limited to record layouts, data dictionaries, code sheets, lookup tables, etc. \r\n\r\nOur preference is to receive structured data provided in a machine-readable text file, such as delimited or fixed-width formats. We can also handle a variety of other data formats including SQL databases, Excel workbooks and MS Access. If there are additional formats your agency would prefer to provide, please let us know. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking this information as a news media organization on a matter of public interest concerning the conduct of government. As such, we ask for a waiver of all fees, if allowed under state law. If fees are necessary to reimburse the agency for actual costs, we agree to pay up to $100. If costs exceed that amount, please let us know before fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease send clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time. Thank you very much for your time and attention to this request.\r\n\r\nElisabeth Gawthrop \r\nData Journalist \r\nAmerican Public Media Research Lab \r\n317-410-7884",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Copies of the potentially responsive documents found in response to the FOIA\r\n    1439032 I filed previously.

A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the 'Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request' link.  Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 98 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 947 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,011 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,360 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request medium processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is January 2024.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  If you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please indicate so and a representative will be in contact.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process? Visit us at http://www.fbi.gov/foia\r\n\r\nPlease check the status of your request online at https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps    Status updates are performed on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nNote:  This is a non-emergency email address.  If this is an emergency, please call 911 directly.  If you need to report a tip for immediate action, please contact FBI Tips at http://tips.fbi.gov/ or reach out to your local field office.\n",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files, memos, emails and other records mentioning or describing the\r\n    convicted killer Charles Friedgood.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I would say the thing I'm most interested in was referenced in the article at https://caughtindot.com/nothing-like-losing-power-on-the-hottest-day-of-the-year/ and involved the manhole cover explosion near N St (where I live). I am most specifically interested in any records that relate to fixes and improvements as a result of this incident.\r\n\r\nI also am more broadly interested in, if available, information on the state of repair of the grid in my neighborhood. Records that communicate or relates to the age, condition, and capacity versus utilization of the grid in City Point would be helpful here.  In lieu of specific records on this question I would be ok with a short summary that indicates that information along with some sort of context as to the likelihood of repeat outage events this coming summer.\r\n\r\nThank you again for taking the time to tend to this.\r\n\r\n-Matt",

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

Its been 75 years and it is time to de-classify these files, both for Kammler's family but also for history. And being new and now in trying to obtain information from our various archives I would like to ask you how do I go about this?\r\n\r\nI know without any doubt that the US forces took Linz and Gusen and the Bergkristal and Kellerbau tunnel systems were surrendered to US forces. It is also certain our forces and intelligence combed and documented these as well as removed what was possibly before handing these over to the Russians.  To be clear these were some of the most important German underground factories and research of the entire war. 1000 jet planes were built here and they were built and run by General Kammler who oversaw the German special projects, making his one of the most important Germans of the Reich. And in a CIC report is was stated we (the US) had him for interrogation in Gemunden in May 1945. \r\n\r\nSo I would like to ask who would have these files? what archive? who would hold still classified CIC reports and reports on German special projects and High level POWs? The CIA? Langley? the FBI - I  know we have them I just dont know who to ask or where to look. \r\n\r\nCertainly after all these years they should be declassified as so many others but how do we go about this.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate any help and searches you can assist me with\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n\r\nSSG Tino Struckmann\r\n",

Furthermore US Forces removed as many machines as was possibly before the hand over to the Russian army in August 1945. \r\nFurthermore Both British and US air forces flew reconnaissance flights and photographed these tunnels and reported on these with photos attached in both 44 and 45. This report was released but the photos and aerial photos from before and after liberation have not been released.  \r\nThese two tunnel systems were extensively documented, photographed and catalogued. Please help me find these photos these were the most technically advanced underground production facilities the Germans built during the war. \r\nToday very few prisoners are still alive and they would like to show the world what their friends there died for, so time is of the essence \r\nI hope this helps",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\n1. This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, submitted to the United States Central Command (\"CENTCOM\") of the United States Department of Defense (\"DoD\").\r\n\r\n2. I hereby request agency records related to the Surface to Air Missile (\"SAM\") attack on January 20, 2007, near Baghdad, Iraq, that killed United States Army Colonel (\"COL\") Brian D. Allgood; COL Paul M. Kelley; Lieutenant Colonel (\"LTC\") David. C Canegata, III; Major (\"MAJ\") Michael V. Taylor; Captain (\"CPT\") Sean E. Lyerly; Command Sergeant Major (\"CSM\") Roger M.

Lake; and Corporal (\"CPL\") Victor M. Langarcia while conducting an UH-60A air assault mission during Operation Iraqi Freedom (\"OIF\") in the CENTCOM Area of Responsibility (\"AOR\"). The SAM attack occurred at Military Grid Reference System (\u201cMGRS\u201d) 38SMC6688600015.\r\n\r\n2.1. COL Allgood was assigned to the Headquarters Company, 30th Medical Brigade, V Corps, Heidelberg, Germany;\r\n2.2. COL Kelley was assigned to Joint Forces Headquarters, Blackstone, Virginia;\r\n2.3. LTC Canegata and SSG Lake were assigned to the Joint Forces Headquarters, Virgin Islands Army National Guard, Christiansted, Saint Croix, US Virgin Islands;\r\n2.4. MAJ Taylor, 1SG Warren, and SFC Brown were assigned to Company B, 1st Battalion, 185th Aviation, Camp Robinson, North Little Rock, Arkansas;\r\n2.5. CPT Lyerly was assigned to the Headquarters Company, 36th Aviation Brigade, Austin, Texas;\r\n2.6. CSM Haller was assigned to Headquarters, 70th Regiment, Camp Fretterd, Reisterstown, Maryland; \r\n2.7. SGM Gabbard was assigned to Joint Forces Headquarters, Forward, Fort Bliss, Texas;\r\n2.8. SSG Booker was assigned to the 29th Tactical Command Post, Sandston, Virginia;\r\n2.9. CPL Langarica was assigned to Company B, 86th Signal Battalion, Fort Huachuca, Arizona;\r\n2.10. The UH-60A's tail number was 84-23984, with a call sign of \"EASY 40\"; and,\r\n2.11. The Combined Information Data Network Exchange\u2013Iraq (\"CIDNE\u2013I\") database report key associated with the SAM attack data is 3FC63644-1143-D62E-D1BA59E83C3A1590.\r\n\r\n3. The following constraints limit this FOIA request:\r\n\r\n3.1. Only specific agency documents related to this SAM attack are requested, including:\r\n\r\n3.1.1. Combined Information Data Network Exchange (\"CIDNE\") Significant Activity (\"SIGACT\") report(s);\r\n3.1.2. Medical Evacuation (\"MEDEVAC\") 9\u2013Line transcript(s);\r\n3.1.3. Assault Support Request(s) (\"ASR\");\r\n3.1.4. Composite Timeline report(s);\r\n3.1.5. Storyboard report(s);\r\n3.1.6. Serious Incident Report(s) (\"SIR\");\r\n3.1.7. Weapons Team Intelligence report(s);\r\n3.1.8. Intelligence Directorate (\u201cC2\u201d) Operations Watch Highlights report(s);\r\n3.1.9. Battle Damage Assessment (\u201cBDA\u201d) reports(s);\r\n3.1.10. Multi National Division (\"MND\")/Multi National Corps\u2013Iraq (\"MNC\u2013I\") Update report(s);\r\n3.1.11. Multi National Force\u2013Iraq (\"MNF\u2013I\") Battle Update Assessment(s) (\"BUA\") briefing slides;\r\n3.1.12. Detainee SPOT report(s);\r\n3.1.13. AR 15\u20136 Investigation reports (s) and/or Command Directed Investigation (\u201cCDI\u201d) report(s);\r\n3.1.14. Hospital casualty update report(s);\r\n3.1.15. Defense Casualty Information Processing System\u2013Forward (\"DCIPS\u2013CF\") report(s).\r\n\r\n3.2. Excluding any documents containing the agency\u2019s deliberative material or recommendations;\r\n3.3. Excluding any documents classified Top Secret (\u201cTS\u201d), Sensitive Compartmented Information (\u201cSCI\u201d), and/or Special Access Program (\u201cSAP\u201d); however,\r\n3.4. Including all of CENTCOM\u2019s responsive documents that are classified below the TS, SCI and/or SAP levels; for example, any documents marked Unclassified (\u201cU\u201d), Sensitive But Unclassified (\u201cSBU\u201d), For Official Use Only (\u201cFOUO\u201d), Confidential (\u201cC\u201d), Law Enforcement Sensitive (\u201cLES\u201d), and/or Secret (\u201cS\u201d).\r\n\r\n4. Although FOIA has always presumed that government records are open to public inspection, the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Pub. L. 114-185, prohibits agencies from withholding records unless (1) \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law\u201d or (2) \u201cthe agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by\u201d one of FOIA\u2019s exemptions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A). Thus, in addition to FOIA favoring disclosure and requiring its exemptions to be narrowly construed, Section 552(a)(8)(A) prohibits agencies from using their discretion to broadly withhold records merely because they believe an exemption could technically apply.\r\n\r\n5. In order to expedite CENTCOM\u2019s release of the requested documents, please disclose them on an interim, rolling basis as they become available; for example, without waiting for all of the agency\u2019s relevant systems of record to be searched, or all of its relevant records to be processed. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\n6. If CENTCOM\u2019s processing costs for this request exceed $350.00, please notify me in advance so that I might consider paying any additional fees for a complete and accurate set of responsive documents. The requested documents will be made available to the general public and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n7. Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid Scantling",
