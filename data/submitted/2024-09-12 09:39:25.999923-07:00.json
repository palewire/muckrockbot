        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nSubject: Public Records Request for Closed Investigative and Incident Reports\r\n\r\nDear Public Records Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act (Government Code Section 6250 et seq.), I am requesting the following records:\r\n\r\nInvestigative and incident reports related to a 2016 burglary case involving a man named Gary Baston, whose home in Rancho Cucamonga was burglarized. The case involved the use of license plate readers (LPRs) and security camera footage to help identify and apprehend the suspects. The vehicle was identified by a round bumper sticker, and the suspects were later caught, leading to the recovery of many of Mr. Baston\u2019s stolen items.\r\n\r\nAll closed investigative reports from 2020 to the present that mention the use of LPRs in conjunction with bumper stickers. Specifically, I am requesting records that include the keywords \"bumper sticker\" and \"LPR\" or \"License Plate Reader\". I also encourage the department to consider any additional search terms that may yield responsive records based on these parameters.\r\n\r\nUnder Government Code Section 6253(b), a request is considered valid if it provides \"a reasonably focused and effective description\" of the records sought. I believe that the keywords I have suggested are sufficiently specific to allow the department to identify responsive records, as they pertain to the use of LPR technology in identifying vehicles by their bumper stickers.\r\n\r\nSince these records pertain to closed investigations, they should be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act. The California Supreme Court has consistently upheld the presumption of disclosure for records related to closed cases, except under specific, limited exemptions, none of which apply here. Additionally, as the Sheriff\u2019s Department has previously spoken publicly about the use of LPRs, the records are not protected under confidentiality for investigative techniques.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in electronic format if possible. If any portions of the records are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide the non-exempt portions and specify the legal basis for any redactions or withholdings.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this request. I look forward to your response within the legally mandated timeframe. If you need any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

        "communication": "Dear Alexa Gagosz, This email acknowledges receipt of your attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Your request was received by this office on September 11, 2024. The FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires USDA to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt.\u00a0The Federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous records that will necessitate a wide-ranging search including searches with components and possible consultations with components that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, USDA will invoke a 10 business day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records. Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Pursuant to USDA FOIA Regulations, Title 7 CFR \u00a71.6(a), the USDA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Provisions of the FOIA allow USDA to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.

For your review and information, a copy of the USDA FOIA Fee Schedule is attached. In accordance with 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section 3(b), your fees shall be waived where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less. If you requested a fee waiver, please note that it is currently under consideration. A search will be conducted for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. A FOIA\u00a0specialist will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. Your request has been assigned FOIA Case No. . Please refer to this case number in any future correspondence. If you have any questions regarding the processing of this request, please reply directly to this message or contact 2024-FSIS-00345-F or FOIA specialist Luke Harman at Luke.Harman@usda.gov.

Briefcam audit logs are recorded in a database that can be exported or accessed via API so I ask that you provide it to me as a .csv, .xls, or other database filetype.\r\n\r\n3) Metadata for each real-time and smart alert generated by the department's Briefcam system from 1/1/2024 until the date this request is processed. Briefcam automatically notifies authorized users when connected cameras detect pre-defined events (e.g. a crowd gathering) or profiles (e.g. a vehicle of interest). Please note that I am not requesting the video footage or any personally identifying information associated with the alert, but rather the metadata. Metadata includes, but is not limited to: the type of alert, any rules set for the alert, the date and time of the alert, who received the alert, locations associated with the alert, and algorithmic confidence scores associated with the alert. This metadata is stored in a database so I ask that you provide it to me as a .csv, .xls, or other database filetype.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, please do not hesitate to ask. If you would like to set up a time to discuss this request over the phone, please email me at tfeathers@gizmodo.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you determine certain records or portions of records are exempt from disclosure, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation of the records or portions of records being withheld and the statutory exemptions under which they are being withheld.\r\n\r\nI am requesting these records as a journalist in order to write articles in the public interest about the operations of a government agency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
