Project Fantasia was a collaboration between the Office of Strategic Services (record group 226) and the Office of Scientific Research and Development (record group 227), and was assigned a project number of SAC-26. A 2016 article published by NARA in Prologue Magazine, titled \"Secret Weapons, Forgotten Sacrifices,\" contains a description of Project Fantasia and identifies some of the records as being in record group 227. It can be found here: https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2016/spring/office-scientific-research-development-world-war-ii\r\n\r\nPlease restrict your search for any records to record groups 226 and 227.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to review these records in-person, at your location in College Park, Maryland. If any of these records are being held at a facility other than the one in College Park, please notify me of this before processing the request.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please advise which tier of processing queue this request falls under and an estimated time frame for processing.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said destruction or transfer, to include but not be limited to confirmation that NARA has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

The request was for \"Cobwebs Contract\".\r\nYour request has been forwarded to the appropriate program area(s) to identify documents that are responsive to your request, and which may be made available pursuant to all applicable provisions of the Freedom of Information Law.\r\nA determination as to whether your request is granted or denied will be reached on or before June 6, 2024, or we will notify you in writing if the responsible program area(s) should require additional time to locate, assemble and review documents that may be responsive to your request.\r\nPlease note that, pursuant to Article 6 of the Public Officers Law, a charge may be applied to your request, including the actual cost of the medium used to respond to your Freedom of Information Law request and/or other related costs.  When responsive records have been identified, you will be informed of any cost and how payment should be made.\r\nPLEASE NOTE: **\r\nAs we have acknowledged your request, please refrain from submitting duplicate requests for the same records through Open FOIL.

Office of the Governor v. Engelkemier, 148 A.3d 522, 530 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016). A request must identify the subject matter, the scope, and the timeframe of the records sought.  You provided a time frame of the records you are seeking.  However, your request has no defined group of individuals whose records are to be searched nor does it identify any subject matter, but states that you are seeking \"[c]opies of all 'change requests' or reasonably similar correspondence\" which does not indicate some business of the agency and would likely lead to a broad universe of responsive records. Therefore, your request is insufficiently specific.\r\n\r\nIn order for the department to process your request, please identify a subject matter of the communications regarding \"change requests\" you are seeking.  The subject matter of the request must identify the 'transaction or activity' of the agency for which the record is sought.  Please also identify the specific people at the department (or a group, such as senior staff) that may have sent or received the communications you are seeking.\r\n\r\nYour prompt response will be appreciated so that the department can continue working on your request.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAndrea Bankes | Agency Open Records Officer\r\nOffice of Administration\r\nDepartment of Human Services\r\nRoom 234 Health & Welfare Building | Hbg PA 17120\r\nPhone: 717.787.3422 | Fax: 717.772.2490\r\nwww.dhs.pa.gov<http://www.dhs.pa.gov/>\r\n\r\nCreating partnerships to deliver quality services to customers through collaboration, consultation and supports.\n",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for a grant and/or contract awarded by the United States Department of State to the Global Internet Freedom Consortium (GIFC) in 2010. Please see the following link from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC): http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8678760.stm\r\n\r\nThe lede in the above BBC article states: \"A Falun Gong-linked group that promotes internet freedom says the US state department has offered it $1.5m, in a move condemned by Chinese officials.\"\r\n\r\nThe GIFC, as noted, is linked to practitioners of Falun Gong, a new religious movement originating from China. Falun Gong members have created and currently run non-profit organizations, media companies, and human rights groups, all of which focus on censorship and human rights abuses in China, and because of this, the group and its associated entities have received public and financial support from the United States government.\r\n\r\nYet, in 2021, news organizations such as National Public Radio (NPR) reported on disputes within the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM) over a contract (award ID: 95170021K0011) awarded to Ultrareach Internet Corp. (UEI: P9R8NZXL3SH3), a member of the GIFC, in 2020. Please see the following link from NPR: https://www.npr.org/2021/04/14/986982387/falun-gong-steve-bannon-and-the-trump-era-battle-over-internet-freedom\r\n\r\nIn the above NPR article, Matthew Baise, director of digital strategy and audience development for Voice of America, a child organization of the USAGM, was quoted from an internal audit as stating the following of Ultrasurf, software developed by Ultrareach Internet Corp. and promoted by the GIFC: \"We spent nearly two weeks checking and double-checking how the number could possibly be this low. We believe the true, final number of measurable traffic from Ultrasurf to be so miniscule because a) none of the networks were ever notified of its existence so it was never promoted b) it's only available for Windows desktop machines (almost all our audience is on mobile devices) and c) it is a brand new product. In the absence of promotion on Ultrasurf's end, this thing was essentially invisible.\"\r\n\r\nGiven public reporting on the dispute over contract ID 95170021K0011 and the apparent failure of Ultrasurf to meet the parameters of that contact, any other financial support, whether through grants or contracted work, awarded to the GIFC and its member organizations can reasonably be understood as being of public interest.\r\n\r\nThis request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Correspondence (traditional mail, faxes, email, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by the Global Internet Freedom Consortium\r\n\r\nI am asking you to waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Reasons for public interest have been noted above.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis is a Freedom of Information Act Request for all documents after February 9, 2022, listing the following:\r\n\r\n The amount of individuals whose records were disposed of, in whole or part, using the minimization procedure under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows for bulk warrantless electronic surveillance of  non-consenting Americans, and the collection of their personal communication and other things on Americans that are not publicly available, that are collected either through direct targeting of Americans under FISA Title VII, which is about to expire, or are collected on non-consenting Americans incidentally pursuant to targeting a foreign actor, then is destroyed (the information collected). This is also a request for the number of individuals 702-acquired information was disposed of, purged, deleted, removed, or destroyed, including destroyed upon recognition, in whole or part, because of noncompliance incidents, including but not limited to when violations of law occurred. Some of this destruction of 702-acquired information and destruction of other FISA-acquired information that were destroyed in violations of law is permitted under FISC Rules of Procedure, Rule 13, as was created by Congress.\r\n\r\nWhile the government\u2019s reason behind disposing of personal communication and other information collected on non consenting Americans who are electronically surveilled appears to seem to protect American\u2019s privacy, it can have the opposite effect if used to cover when the surveillance or other related activities were carried out illegally or information was collected in noncompliance with law. This is especially problematic when federal contractors, who concurrently worked with the government on military matters, law enforcement, and national security matters were sued in a court of law for targeting innocent Americans in clandestine investigations on behalf of corporate clients. Please see Case 1:15-cv-09796-JSR, opinion issued by Judge Jed S. Rakoff in United States District Court of New York, signed July 25, 2016 and GSA   Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services (MOBIS) Contract GS-10F-0010X, both concerning the federal contracting company known as Global Precision Research. Please see https://highergov.com/awardee/global-precision-research-llc-13199850/ (last retrieved December 1, 2023). \r\n\r\nThis is also a request for all documents related to the complete removal of all Section 702-acquired information from the FBI system mentioned on page 39 of the publicly released April 21, 2022 dated Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court Opinion and Order that was declassified partially and authorized for public release on May 19, 2023, by DNI. Users of this system also were advised to use Sharepoint, as is mentioned on the same page. I believe this is a cloud system. Furthermore, this is a request for the entire FISC Opinion and Order to be declassified, including all related documents, including but not limited to the following: memos, motions, exhibits, discussing all noncompliance incidents under FISA and related law.\r\nI would have addressed this earlier but issues arose.\r\n\r\nI ask for a waiver or fees, as this request is not being made for commercial purposes. Furthermore, I have worked free of charge at getting laws passed, including laws for children, such as laws banning corporal punishment against disabled students in Louisiana public and charter schools, and am currently working on a book to raise awareness that I made publicly available at no charge in a very, very rough draft form on shortcomings in federal labor laws in Agriculture that affect children, shortcomings in FERPA laws concerning online education and children\u2019s privacy rights, and FISA law in a highly fictional manner. I wish to see FISA law changed so that there is a way to document Americans who were surveilled and what was collected on them while also protecting 4th Amendment Rights. See https://www.change.org/p/please-amend-louisiana-revised-statute-17-223-and-17-416-1-which-allows-corporal-punishment-in-louisiana-schools-against-disabled-students , https://beitcrew.com/pages/copy-of-child-advocacy-with-be-it-crew , https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/home\r\n\r\nPlease contact me if the fees exceed 100 dollars.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, \r\n\r\nShayna A. Pitre\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
