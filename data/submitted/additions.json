Specifically those pertaining to conditions, design decisions or other that resulted an increase in proposed project costs over that period from an initial estimate of $100m in 2019 (as evidenced in MBTA HS32PS01) to $571M in 2022 (FY23 CIP) and $1.1B in 2024 (FY25 CIP). \r\n\r\nAdditionally all documents, drawings and other materials submitted to the United States Department of Transportation in support of the MBTA / MassDOTs most recent application to the MEGA grant program for the same Draw 1 project.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
