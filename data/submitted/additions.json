The first and second columns of the spreadsheet should indicate the year and city/town/county, respectively, and the third should report the number of officers. \r\n\r\n- Additionally, I request the number of officers per city/town/county and year who retire from the police force, and who are hired from the police force, in the fourth and fifth columns, respectively.\r\n\r\nIf the above information exists only in part, I request that you share what you have rather than deny the request in full.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
