This information is critical to my participation in the oversight and administration of this program.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I am requesting accommodations due to my condition. I respectfully request that all records be provided electronically via email, as opposed to portals or complex delivery methods, to ensure full and equal access to the information.\r\n\r\nScope of Request:\r\nLegislative Records:\r\n\r\nAll bills, amendments, resolutions, legislative proposals, and legislative history related to the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nVoting records of all state and federal legislators on any legislation affecting the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nMinutes, transcripts, and audio/video recordings of meetings, hearings, or discussions where the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program was a topic.\r\nPublic Records:\r\n\r\nComprehensive reports, studies, assessments, and evaluations on the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nBudget allocations, financial statements, expenditure reports, and audit results related to the program, pursuant to Connecticut Budget Transparency Laws (C.G.S. \u00a7 4-66 and related sections).\r\nAll contracts, agreements, memoranda of understanding, and intergovernmental agreements involving the administration or management of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nCorrespondence:\r\n\r\nAll emails, letters, and other forms of communication, including internal and external, regarding the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nInternal memoranda, briefing documents, policy directives, and decision-making correspondence related to the oversight and implementation of the program.\r\nPersonnel Records:\r\n\r\nNon-confidential employment records, including job descriptions, resumes, and performance evaluations, of individuals involved in the administration and oversight of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.
