Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989):** Underscoring the need for a functional analysis of the requested documents, focusing on the nature and content of the information rather than the identity of the parties involved.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a detailed justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease be aware of your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request will be instantly published on the platform.",

But as you might guess, the request references a large number of records.  As he said, we must thoroughly review all records to identify and obtain the responsive documents from both external and internal sources.  It is a complex and time-consuming process.\r\n\r\nI am confident that we will have documents ready to provide on or before the December 6th, 2023, date noted in our recent communication.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience!\r\nRegards,\r\nRenee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA121F.C2136CB0]",

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Miranda,\r\n\r\nThank you for your letter dated October 30. I recognize the need to weigh the burden of fulfilling the request against the public interest in the information. I am surprised that your search returned 3,710 pages of responsive records. That figure is 7 times greater than the number of pages returned by a similar search conducted by the Mayor's Office (509 pages) and 9 times greater than the responsive records returned by the City Council Committee on Workforce Development (392 pages). \r\n\r\nBefore I narrow my request, could you please confirm that your office conducted a search for the exact, compound phrases \"fair workweek\", \"fair work week\", or \"fair scheduling\"? If the initial search did not use quotation marks or Boolean operators to filter out partial matches containing only one key word (e.g. \"scheduling\"), it likely returned many irrelevant results. For example, a Google search of the key words (fair workweek fair scheduling) without quotation marks yields more than 5.5 million results (https://www.google.com/search?q=fair+scheduling+fair+workweek). By contrast, enclosing the relevant phrases in quotation marks (\"fair workweek\" \"fair scheduling\") yields only 1,390 results (https://www.google.com/search?q=%22fair+scheduling%22+%22fair+workweek%22). \r\n\r\nI appreciate your offer to share an index of the emails. Assuming the index includes the date of each email, it would shed light on the relevance of the initial search results. Most of the public discussion and legislative action around the Chicago Fair Workweek Ordinance occurred between June 2018 and July 2019 with a peak around June or July 2019. The date distribution of search results should reflect this, with relatively few results from earlier in 2018 or later in 2019. If that is not the case in your initial search, it likely contains irrelevant results that can be filtered out through more precise specification of the search parameters.\r\n\r\nIf the initial search was conducted using the exact parameters requested, then I would be willing to narrow my request. I am most interested in emails and attachments sent or received by Aldermen John Arena, Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, and Tom Tunney, since they were not included in the records previously provided to me. According to my list (Aldermanic_addresses_to_search.xlsx), there are 18 email addresses or aliases associated with these 3 Aldermen. To be clear, I am requesting all emails and attachments sent or received during the period 1/1/2018\u201312/31/2019 by Aldermen John Arena, Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, or Tom Tunney that contain one or more of the non-case-sensitive, compound phrases \"fair workweek\", \"fair work week\", or \"fair scheduling.\" \r\n\r\nAs you review my request, I ask that you take into account the considerable public interest in this information. The Chicago Fair Workweek Ordinance establishes the most expansive set of working time regulations since the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. While similar scheduling legislation has passed in a dozen other cities, Chicago is the only jurisdiction in the country to cover manufacturing, warehouse, and health care as well as retail and hospitality workers with comparable protections. My assessment of the public interest in this matter is informed by my expertise as an academic researcher who specializes in labor standards and scheduling practices. I have requested these records as part of the first systematic study of scheduling legislation, a project in which the National Science Foundation found sufficient intellectual merit and public interest to award me a competitive Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (#2203815).\r\n\r\nI look forward to your clarification of the initial search results and continued assistance with my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel, PhD",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \n\n \nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST of December 17, 2022, Reference # R005993-121922 \nDear Ben Welsh, \n\nThis letter is in response to the above-referenced request you submitted to the Department of Fish and Wildlife (Department) pursuant to the Public Records Act (PRA) (Govt. Code, \u00a7 6250 et seq.) on December 17, 2022. \n\nThe Department is initiating a search for records responsive to your request and will make available for inspection or provide copies of all responsive records, if any, that it is able to locate through reasonable efforts and that are not privileged or exempt from disclosure pursuant to the PRA or other applicable law. The Department will seek to make such records available as soon as reasonably possible. In the event the Department will be unable to make the records available within 90 days of your initial request, we will contact you to discuss the matter. \n\nThe PRA requires disclosure of existing records in the possession, custody, or control of a public agency. If the Department locates existing records responsive to your request, Department staff will assemble the disclosable records. You may elect to receive copies of the records or to inspect them in person: \n \n  * If you chose to receive copies electronically, documents maintained in electronic format will be transmitted electronically whenever possible through the PRA Records Center. \n  * If the Department needs to deliver hard copies, you will be charged a copying fee of $.15 per page. The Department will notify you of the total cost prior to mailing the records. Please note the Department cannot waive or reduce these fees and costs for any reason.\u00a0 Once staff are able to return to their offices to make and send the copies, they will be sent to you. \n  * If you chose to inspect the records in person, you will be notified of the availability of the records for inspection. \nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please contact us and reference PRA No. R005993-121922.\u00a0 You may also call (916) 654-3821. \n\nSincerely, \n\nLacy Bauer \n\nTo monitor the progress or update this request please log into the Public Records Center (https://u8387778.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=6HtRfOYLt5fXvpttM-2FU1HZPEhFU-2Bvy2oqrlHBe5M0RGAeT-2B4qUykOWV59A9EEIaMPR3Z61l1qOuhakTThE-2F77Z5F1t1TcgerLoFymh-2FS3eHKUPDgpIT9msrJlkj2-2FcFMQf4B_jdd-2FkHGaRoBK3G4V2uO0vDbhYgkiU4-2B1YD8HTfIqczN55dF3mSU410DOqyTYAD4gF6i8BnQQGcZmYaua-2FJTGomeZaZT92VrODt31-2BkV3BTtdiA2rLWvqMWgNlJHxVDOedpO6nP1e4uaWAoQetVi-2Fu20KssisrWKwK1GWLTmJx1iuDhr4-2BK4fg85r-2FeIFyzr908koPXgTHbSTRx9WLHlIlkM8rVj-2B5dnhAodBgIJPcjg-3D)\n",

        "communication": "Good afternoon, Mr Gregg,\r\nFor your (and others') convenience, the Board has already uploaded our current precincts' shapefile to the \"Chicago Data Portal\" (https://data.cityofchicago.org/ ). Since they carry a number of  such files, one fairly easy way to find the file - using their search bar - is to \r\n1. search for \"precincts\", then \r\n2. scroll through the resulting list to \"Boundaries - Ward Precincts (2023- )\"\r\nYou'll probably find two entries, a \"Map\" view which will show you precincts, and another \"DataSet\" version with a slightly more direct button to the download - although you can reach the same dataset via the map view as well.  \r\nThis precinct map, with 1291 precincts, covers not only this election but the two Municipal Elections (Feb General and April Runoff) in 2023.  In fact, it's nearly the same for the Nov 2022 General (which had 1290 precincts - the first election which we administered using the \"2022 Wards\", derived and approved from the 2020 Census ReDistricting).  Between Nov 2022 and Feb 2023, one precinct - Ward 24 pct 16 - was split in two, subsequently becoming precincts 16 and 20.  Merge Wd 24, pcts 16 & 20 in this file, and it should describe the Nov 2022 results as well .  Previous elections (including the 2022 spring Primary ) used the Wards (and precincts) from the prior Census' redistricting.\r\n\r\nWe also have a number of Ward & Precinct maps, Legislative District maps, Lists of precincts within Legislative Districts, along with election results, etc, via our website \"chicagoelections.gov\",   Currently the March 19 primary results are still being counted, due to obligatory waiting periods for mail ballots, provisional ballots, etc. \r\n\r\nI hope this answers your question.",

Proof of death is not required as his death was widely reported: https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/10/nyregion/donald-barr-82-headmaster-and-science-honors-educator.html. Records are likely to exist on Barr as he was nominated in 1983 to be part of the National Council on Educational Research, a now-defunct body of the Department of Education.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear FBI:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED\r\n\r\nAll records related to Clayland Boyden Gray. Mr. Gray was a lawyer and diplomat who served as White House Counsel from 1989 to 1993 and as U.S. Ambassador to the European Union from 2006 to 2007. He was born on 6 February 1943 in Winston-Salem, NC, USA. He died on 21 May 2023.\r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH\r\nObituaries for Mr. Gray appeared in numerous national media, including the New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/21/obituaries/c-boyden-gray-dead.html and the Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/05/21/c-boyden-gray-white-house-counsel-president-ghw-bush-dies-80/.\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and organizations to see if they contain additional records related to Mr. Gray:\r\n\r\n(1) President George Herbert Walker Bush, to whom the subject served as White House Counsel\r\n(2) Chief Justice Earl Warren, to whom the subject was a law clerk\r\n(3) The Atlantic Counsel, on whose board the subject served\r\n(4) The European Institute, on whose board the subject served\r\n(5) FreedomWorks, on whose board the subject served\r\n(6) The Federalist Society, of which the subject was a member\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray has recently died, so the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray was a public figure. He served as White House Counsel to George H. W. Bush and was the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union. News obituaries for Mr. Gray appeared in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other national media. Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records available online for free via muckrock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that lets people share the results of their FOIA requests and encourages journalism around them.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Mr. Gray has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released until now. Given Mr. Gray's government service as a high-level advisor and employee in the executive and judicial branches, the public's understanding of Mr. Gray, his work, and the work of the government will likely be enhanced significantly.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just an inquisitive citizen. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nThank you for your timely attention to this request.",

        "communication": "Dear OIP:\r\n\r\nI hearby appeal the Bureau's denial of my request for a fee waiver for my FOIPA Request No. 1593177-000 .\r\n\r\n1. The Bureau states that my request failed to meet at least one of the four public interest factors, but it does not say which factor or factors I failed to satisfy or why. This alone is reason enough to reverse the Bureau's decision, because it makes it impossible for the requestor to meaningfully respond to the denial\u2014rendering the denial arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and a denial of due process.\r\n\r\n2. My request meets the legal standard for a fee waiver. The subject of the request was a public figure, with news obituaries of his death appearing in major newspapers, including the New York Times and the Washington Post. Responsive records will be of great interest to historians, political scientists, scholars, the legal academy, and many others. I am making this request via MuckRock.com, which will automatically make all responsive records available to the general public for free. There is simply no reason to deny this fee waiver.\r\n\r\n3. I incorporate by reference the additional arguments I made in my initial request for a fee waiver.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this appeal.\r\n\r\nMost sincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Frank Paul Cali was also known as \"Francesco Paolo Augusto Cal\u00ec\" and \"Franky Boy.\" He was reported by DOJ as being arrested February 7, 2008. He was tried in United States v. Agate (1:08-cr-00076) District Court, Eastern District of New York.\r\n\r\nCali is widely reported to have died March 13, 2019 in Staten Island, NY (see attached article from the NY Times). Records concerning Cali as a subject should thus be assumed exempt from the FOIA Exemption 6, 7(C) and the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of all US Marshals Service systems of records for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, agencies and companies. \r\n\r\nUS Marshals Service systems of records of interest include (but are not limited to) the Internal Affairs System; U.S. Marshals Service Prisoner Processing and Population Management-Prisoner Tracking System; Warrant Information Network (WIN); Witness Security Files Information System; and Inappropriate Communications-Threat Information System. \r\n\r\nPlease also search the DOJ-wide system of records, DOJ-005 Nationwide Joint Automated Booking System (JABS).\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that USMS has no other copies of said records.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nT. McElwee\n\n",

Upon information and belief, the agency is likely to have further records --for instance, a USM-312 (\"Personal History of Defendant\") record. As this was not provided, I believe the agency performed a perfunctory and inadequate search of only one class of record, that did not meet the requirement of \"a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents\" (see Truitt v. Department of State, 897 F. 2d 540 - Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit 1990). \r\n\r\nMy prayer for relief is that the agency remand this case with instructions to broaden its search to all forms and record types that would reasonbly apply to an individual such as Frank Paul Cali, a career criminal and high ranking member of organized crime.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nT.

Spector, a former Military Intelligence Officer from Syracuse, New York, who operated a Cadillac Dealership in Ogdensburg, NY in 1970.

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \" unusual circumstances .\" See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a )( 6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0\u00a0Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact FOIA/PA Unit representative Melanie M. Hoyos at (571) 776-3008 or via e-mail at Melanie.M.Hoyos@dea.gov, our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public. \u00a0You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request . \u00a0Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. \u00a0The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

Copies of contracts into which the department has entered with Othram Inc. between Jan. 1 2018 and the time this request is processed.\r\n2. Copies of any proposals or presentations anyone representing Othram Inc. has presented to the department between Jan. 2018 and the time this request is processed; these may be identifiable by searching for records attached to anyone whose email address ends in @othram.com.\r\n3. Copies of any correspondence between any official in the department with the authority to review contract proposals or enter into contracts and anyone with an email address ending in @othram.com dated between Jan. 1 2018 and the time this request is processed. I also request that any documents attached to any discovered correspondence be provided in .pdf format.\r\n\r\nElectronic records should be produced in their unlocked native format with all original metadata and original filenames. Paper documents should be scanned and produced as Adobe PDF files. Emails produced should be grouped together with any attachments. When searching emails, please search all folders, including inbox, subject matter folders, sent items, archived items, and deleted items. Please produce all metadata fields for emails, including BCC and all others. Please email all records produced to kassidy.dillon@vice.com.\r\n\r\nThe above request is a matter of public interest.  The requested documents will be used in the course of reporting for VICE News. As such, we request a fee waiver. The disclosure of the information sought is not for commercial purposes; instead, it will contribute to the public\u2019s understanding of government operations. \r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the California Public Records Act. Please inform us of the reason(s) for such denial in writing, and provide the name, mailing address, and email address of the person or body to whom an appeal should be directed. I expect the release of all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. Please do not redact any non-responsive information from any records; we request the complete copies of any records with any responsive information. \r\n\r\nIn the interest of time, I request that you provide documents as they become available rather than waiting for the complete set.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\n\nKassidy Dillon",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll Department of Homeland Security (DHS) records responsive to Cobwebs Technologies and Tangles.\r\n\r\nTangles is identified in a recent report from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis titled \"Operations in Portland\". This was report was first issued on April 20, 2021 but a revised version was published by Senator Ron Wyden on his website on October 27, 2022 (https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/I&A%20and%20OGC%20Portland%20Reports.pdf). The revised report states on page 55 that Tangles is a \"social media aggregation tool\" that was used by DHS Open Source Collection Operations to compile information on individuals attending the 2020 George Floyd protests in Portland, Oregon using \"available social media profiles.\"\r\n\r\nCobwebs Technologies has publicly acknowledged itself as the creator of Tangles on its website (https://cobwebs.com/using-web-intelligence-for-criminal-investigations/), which states Tangles is a \"web intelligence platform\" that can \"obtain precise and unrivaled web intelligence in the open and dark web in a fraction of the time it used to take.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am requesting all responsive records including, but not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Current and previous contracts with Cobwebs Technologies\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Initial Bid Documents\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Procurement Request Packages\r\n\r\n- Change Order Requests issued by either DHS or Cobwebs Technologies\r\n\r\n- Privacy impact assessments for Tangles\r\n\r\n- Product manuals for Tangles\r\n\r\n- Instructional materials or presentations by Cobwebs Technologies and/or for Tangles\r\n\r\n- Use policies and standard operating procedures for Tangles\r\n\r\n- Data retention policies for Tangles\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

In that communication, the Assistant FOIA Officer stated DHS(I&A) would need to invoke a 10-day extension on top of the traditional 20 business day FOIA response period. Given that the acknowledgment letter was dated for May 31, 2023, the full 30 business days would have expired on July 12, 2023. As of July 14, 2023, I have yet to receive any follow-up communications from DHS(I&A) regarding FOIA request 2023-IAFO-00273. Therefore, I am requesting an update on the status of this request.
