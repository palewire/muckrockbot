        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Nebraska Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW Ch. 42.56 (Public Records Act), I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nCell site simulators, also known as IMSI catchers, IMEI catchers, GSM interceptors, covert cellular tracking equipment, and digital analyzers, impersonate a wireless service provider's (i.e., mobile phone company's or cellular phone company's) cell tower, prompting mobile phones and other wireless devices to communicate with the simulators instead of with the real cell towers. These devices are often called \"Stingrays,\" the name of one such device produced by Harris Corporation, along with their AmberJack, BlackFin, KingFish, Gossamer, LoggerHead, and TriggerFish devices.\r\n\r\nCell site simulators are commonly used in several ways: to collect unique numeric identifiers associated with each mobile phone in a given geographic area, to determine the precise location of a mobile phone when numbers associated with it are known but only a rough idea of its location is known, or to intercept phone calls and SMS messages.\r\n\r\nEach of these uses raises privacy concerns, the most obvious of which is presented by the interception of voice and SMS messages. Collecting unique identifiers of all phones in a particular area inevitably collects location data on many innocent people who are suspected of no crime. Determination of the precise location of a specific phone can reveal that the phone, and thus the person who operates it, is in a constitutionally-protected place, such as a home, that has traditionally been immune from search without judicial approval via search warrant. The locations of people's mobile phones reveal a variety of personal information, such as: with whom they associate, where they assemble, where they spend their days, where they spend their nights, when they are home alone, where they protest, where they worship, and health care providers they visit.\r\n\r\nIt has been widely reported in recent months that law enforcement agencies use these devices while hiding their use from the public and from the courts.\r\n\r\nDespite widespread public interest in the use and misuse of cell site simulators, the public lack information about your agency's use of these devices or about your agency's policy for such use. Information is needed so the public can determine whether use of cell site simulators by your agency complies with the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and with Washington law.\r\n\r\n## Request ##\r\n\r\nPursuant to Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Public Records Act, I request:\r\n\r\n1. Records regarding your agency's acquisition of cell site simulators, including but not limited to invoices, purchase orders, contracts, loan agreements, evaluation agreements, solicitation letters, correspondence with companies and public agencies that provide the devices, and similar documents.\r\n\r\n2. Records regarding any offer, proposal, arrangement, agreement, or memorandum of understanding with Washington State Patrol (\"WSP\"), Naval Criminal Investigative Service (\"NCICS\"), Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), U.S. Marshals Service, FBI's Data Intercept Technology Unit (\"DITU\"), King County Regional Intelligence Group (\"KCRIG\"), Pierce County Regional Intelligence Group (\"PCRIG\"), South Sound Regional Intelligence Group (\"SSRIG\"), or any corporation, to borrow, permanently acquire from, or use any cell site simulator owned or possessed by the WSP, NCICS, FBI, U.S. Marshals, DITU, KCRIG, PCRIG, SSRIG, or corporation\r\n\r\n3. All nondisclosure agreements with Harris Corporation, Digital Receiver Technology (DRT, formerly Utica Systems, now a subsidiary of Boeing Corporation), Septier Communication Limited, Proximus LLC, any other corporation, and any state or federal agencies, regarding your agency's actual or potential possession or use of cell site simulators\r\n\r\n4. Records regarding policies and guidelines governing use of cell site simulators, including but not limited to 1) when, where, how, and against whom they devices may be used, 2) logging, retention, purging, use, and auditing data stored in or communicated from the devices, 3) under what circumstances administrative warrant, judicial warrant, or other legal process must, should, or should not be obtained prior to, during, or following direct or indirect use of the devices, 4) under what circumstances the existence or use of the devices must, should, or should not be revealed to judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, criminal defendants, or the general public., and 5) parallel construction techniques for use in avoidance of disclosure of the initial method of discovery of information gained initially by use of cell site simulators\r\n\r\n5. Training materials for use of cell site simulators\r\n\r\n6. Records regarding any communications or agreements with wireless service providers (i.e., mobile phone carriers such as AT&T, CenturyLink, CREDO Mobile, MetroPCS, Sprint, Ting, T-Mobile, Verizon, Virgin Mobile, etc.) concerning use of cell site simulators\r\n\r\n7. Records regarding any communications, licenses, waivers, or agreements, with federal or state communications regulatory agencies (e.g., Federal Communications Commission, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, Idaho Public Utilities Commission, Oregon Public Utility Commission, etc.) concerning use of cell site simulators\r\n\r\n8. Records reflecting the number of investigations in which cell site simulators were used, the number of those investigations that resulted in prosecutions, and the number of those investigations that resulted in convictions\r\n\r\n9. Records reflecting a list of all criminal cases, with docket numbers if available, in which law enforcement officers or other staff used or arranged for the use of one or more cell site simulators as part of the underlying investigations\r\n\r\n10. All applications submitted to state or federal courts for warrants, orders, or other other authorization for use of cell site simulators in criminal investigations, as well as any warrants, orders, authorizations, denials of warrants, denials of orders, denials of authorization, and returns of warrants associated with those applications\r\n\r\n11. Records regarding the use of cell site simulators in closed investigations\r\n\r\n12. Date and docket number of any responsive records that are sealed\r\n\r\n13. All associated metadata\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Williams\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

We have successfully received your public records request and will respond as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nRequests for public records are processed in the order that they are received and can take up to 30 business days to be fulfilled and/or invoiced. Processing time may be longer due to the nature and extent of the request. Furthermore, the processing time may be affected by other business processes that have statutory and/or court ordered time limits for completion and, therefore, will take priority over a public records request.\r\n\r\nShould your request require extensive clerical or supervisory costs, you will be provided an invoice for the estimated costs associated with your request; this estimate must be paid prior to the start of any records production.\r\n\r\nThe result for some requests requiring extensive clerical or supervisory labor may be negative and BCSO may not have records responsive to the public records request. Deposits will not be returned for labor expended researching requests even if the search produces no responsive records.\r\n\r\nPublic records requests will be closed if the requesting party fails to pay the estimated or final invoice, or fails to respond to clarification inquiries pertaining to a public records request thirty (30) days following the issuance of the invoice or clarification inquiry. If you have previously received an estimated or final invoice and you have not paid the costs associated with that request, BCSO will not provide records for subsequent requests until such time as the past due amounts have been paid. After payment is received, the outstanding request will be resubmitted and processed as a new request. If a response to an inquiry for clarification is made after 30 days from the inquiry, the request will be resubmitted and processed as a new request.\r\n\r\nPlease note: Schedule of Fees for Public Records Reproduction Records Check: $2.00 / per last name inquiry Local record of those persons booked into the Brevard County Jail. Case Report: $0.15 / single sided copy if request is 10 pages or more $.20 / double-sided copy By Mail \u2013 Add self-addressed stamped envelope CD/DVD: $1.00 / each (plus service charge if applicable) Due to security concerns, we will not accept any CD/DVD, memory stick, or any other device for duplication. Service Charge: Requestors will be charged for employee\u2019s labor cost when the request takes 15 or more minutes to fulfill. Any specialty costs, to include technological resources or extensive research time will be subject to further expense. Advance deposit may be required for extensive requests. Methods of Payment Individuals may pay for records reproduction fees by one of the following: Money Order/Cashier Check, Cash, Business Check, Credit Card.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for award IDs N0002420F8124 and N0002421F8162, for contracts given to the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, LLC in the research area of \"directed energy bio effects.\" These contracts have action dates of August 4, 2020 and August 31, 2021 respectively and were awarded by the Department of Defense through the Naval Sea Systems Command. This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, LLC\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and Philly Voice, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to its research into the subject of directed energy, as currently there is a concern among the members of the media and the public about so-called anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAnomalous health incidents, also known as Havana Syndrome, are events occurring between 2016 and the present day that have resulted in a condition, or a series of related conditions, afflicting intelligence agents and diplomats working for the governments of the United States and Canada. In 2016, the Associated Press reported on a number of such incidents that happened in Cuba that led to the United States pulling staff from its embassy in that country. Since that time, anomalous health incidents have continued to generate media attention in major new outlets, with stories focusing on the national security implications appearing in the New York Times and The New Yorker, among many other publications. Speculation presently focuses on the use of directed energy weapons, or ranged weapons that attack a target with electromagnetic energy like ultra-high frequency radio waves, as one possible cause for anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAs of 2023, there have been over 200 reported anomalous health incidents, with many of the victims stating they were subject to attacks by directed energy weapons. Given that most of these individuals have been identified as high-ranking officials across multiple federal agencies, any programs that may be investigating anomalous health incidents and/or the effects of directed energy on humans would be the subject of considerable public interest. This is especially important in light of the fact that both Congress and the President approved compensation, in the range of $140,000 or $187,000 per person, to individuals diagnosed as suffering from anomalous health incidents as part of the implementation of the HAVANA Act of 2021.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
