Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), emphasizes FOIA\u2019s purpose of informing the public about \u201cwhat their government is up to,\u201d supporting the transparency of technical records.\r\n\t2.\tTesting and Evaluation Reports:\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords documenting testing and evaluations of the TF39 engine to assess performance, safety, and operational efficiency.\r\nLegal Basis: Department of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352 (1976), establishes that exemptions must be narrowly construed to uphold FOIA\u2019s goal of public access.\r\n\t3.\tProcurement Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tContracts, agreements, or procurement documentation between the Department of Defense, the Air Force, and General Electric relating to the TF39 engine.\r\nLegal Basis: In Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), the Court ruled that information unrelated to internal personnel rules is not exempt under FOIA Exemption 2.\r\n\t4.\tMaintenance Protocols and Standards:\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords outlining maintenance standards, procedures, and guidelines for the operation and upkeep of the TF39 engine.\r\nLegal Basis: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 857 F. Supp. 2d 44 (D.D.C. 2012), reaffirms that agencies bear the burden of justifying nondisclosure of requested materials.\r\n\t5.\tInteragency Communications and Collaboration:\r\n\t\u2022\tCorrespondence between the Air Force, DoD, and General Electric, including internal memoranda or communications about the TF39 engine\u2019s development, maintenance, and eventual retirement.\r\nLegal Basis: Disclosure of interagency communications is supported by John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146 (1989), where the Court emphasized FOIA\u2019s intent to reveal \u201cthe workings of the government.\u201d\r\n\t6.\tDeclassified Records of C-5 Galaxy and TF39 Engine Upgrades or Modifications:\r\n\t\u2022\tAny records reflecting upgrades or modifications to the TF39 engine or C-5 Galaxy since their initial production, including performance improvements and eventual transition to newer systems.\r\nLegal Basis: In American Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011), the court mandated disclosure of declassified records to promote FOIA\u2019s transparency objectives.\r\n\r\nSegregability of Non-Exempt Portions\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the requested records is deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions, as required by Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). Agencies must provide detailed justifications for withheld information, including an exemption log.\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records\r\n\r\nPlease note your legal obligation to preserve all potentially responsive records. Any destruction of such records without proper justification constitutes a violation of FOIA\u2019s statutory requirements.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nAs an independent investigative journalist with Transparency Report, I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of the requested information serves the public interest by significantly enhancing public understanding of military aviation technology and government operations. This request is not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Under Cause of Action v. FTC, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015), fee waivers must be granted for requests that contribute to public understanding of government activities.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $200 for processing fees and request prior notification if costs exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) because the requested information pertains to matters of significant public interest involving national defense and advancements in military aviation.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: In Al-Fayed v. CIA, 254 F.3d 300 (D.C. Cir. 2001), the Court recognized the need for expedited processing for issues of compelling public interest.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records in electronic format where possible. As stipulated by FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days. If any part of this request is unclear, please contact me at Jordan@Lassiter.eu for clarification.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter",
