Mr. Parris, who went by numerous aliases and pseudonyms including \"Professor de Herbert\" and \"Professor Uriah Konje\" was a Barbadian-born, Harlem-based writer of mystic numerology.

Dream Book (as Professor Uriah Konje)\r\nThe Combination Dream Book \r\nThe Lucky Star Dream Book\r\n\r\nThe publication of these materials made Parris an exceptionally wealthy Afro-Caribbean in New York by the late 1930s. Parris pontificated in his writings about the Ku Klux Klan and Marcus Garvey. According to information online, Parris hired FBI informant HERBERT S. BOULIN as an employee. There is likely to be agency documentation related to Parris in files related to: the Ku Klux Klan, Marcus Garvey, Herbert S.
