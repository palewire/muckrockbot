Also, as a reporter for WIRED, the requested documents are in the public interest and not being made for commercial purposes. Therefore, I ask that all fees are waived in the processing of my request. \r\n\r\nWhen completing this request, please prioritize whichever records would take the least amount of time to be located and released.  Also, I would like these records in electronic format, sent via email or other digital method. Also, if you determine that any of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, I ask you to note whether the exemption is discretionary, and if so, whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nIf there are any questions about my request, or I can provide any clarification that will help expedite the processing of my request, please contact me here. I am also happy to hop on the phone. Thanks again, and I look forward to your reply within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires, as the statute requires, and even sooner if possible.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nCaroline Haskins",
