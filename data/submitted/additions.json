Only material that is unclassified and covered by the Freedom of Information Act is sought through this request.\r\n\r\nGiven the high amount of public interest, as demonstrated by the extensive coverage in the news media (CBS News, NBC News, CNN, Forbes, Fox News, Newsweek, POLITICO, PBS, etc), I ask that any and all fees be waived.
