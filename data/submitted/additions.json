        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAccording to FOIAed documents released by Frequency Forward, Jordan Wick was detailed from DOGE (or possibly the OPM) to the FCC on March 18th, 2025 (see https://frequencyfwd.com/files/motion-exhibit-1-08252025.pdf). In these documents, Jordan Wick sends an undated letter to the FCC stating that he is a software engineer for Department of Government Efficiency who will be providing his services for free for up to 40 hours a week over 120 days. From a separate exhibit in a different case, I also know that Jordan Wick was onboarded as a full-time employee of the CFPB on March 5th.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that any outside employment would need to be approved by CFPB lawyers before it could commence. I would like to request any communications between March 5th and March 18th about Jordan WIck's work at other agencies, especially if this required approval from CFPB staff or leadership. I would also like to understand if Jordan Wick's position at the CFPB has been a paid one or if he is serving in a voluntary capacity in his role. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Harris",
