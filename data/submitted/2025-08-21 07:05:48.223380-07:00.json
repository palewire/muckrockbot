        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) records, documents, and communications responsive to John Clifford Ellsworth, aka Clifford J. Ellsworth, aka John Jaymes, aka John James, aka Thomas Fiorella (April 04 1946 \u2014 December 21, 1994; SSN 132-34-2550).\r\n\r\nMr. Ellsworth was a criminal forger and associate of the Gambino crime family. Mr. Ellsworth was connected to a business, the International Children's Appeal (ICA), that appeared in a 20/20 segment, \"In the Name of Charity\", on July 19, 1979, for engaging in financial fraud and money laundering. The business targeted a United Nations charity, UNICEF, as part of a year-long fundraising event, the International Year of the Child.\r\n\r\nIn the 20/20 segment, it was revealed Mr. Ellsworth maintained connections to the Gambino crime family, and had intended to use the ICA to help a Gambino captain, James Vincent Eppolito, launder money obtained through drug trafficking. Reporters working for 20/20 stated Mr. Ellsworth both leading up to and during this period worked as a government informant, naming the Drug Enforcement Administration as one of the agencies that he worked for.\r\n\r\nDocuments disclosed during  subsequent court case, United States of America v. Frank Cosolito and Ralph Russo (Crim. No. 79-436-C), revealed Mr. Ellsworth also worked for the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service. A judgment from that case can be found here: https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/488/531/1400252/\r\n\r\nIn response to press coverage of his exploits, Mr. Ellsworth stated to a journalist working for the Washington Post that he \"once took a fall\" for the CIA, indicating that he maintained some sort of association with the agency. A copy of the Washingtonian Post article can be found here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1979/12/02/the-mysterious-connections-of-john-ellsworth/6044c556-88b1-480c-b6ce-cc24043a0805/\r\n\r\nThe CIA appears to have maintained some sort of interest in Mr. Ellsworth, as a copy of the Washington Post article can be found in its CREST system: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80B01554R003300190041-5.pdf\r\n\r\nThe article can be found on pages 2 and 5 of the linked document. These pages include the following underlined sections:\r\n\r\n1. \"One partner with alleged American CIA connections who actually dealt in arms, with a 'catalog' that included a 'laser gun that can cut a tree in half.'\"\r\n\r\n2. \"Ellsworth laughs when told that many of his former employees at ICA are convinced that he himself is in no danger because it is widely believed in certain criminal circles that he 'works for the CIA.'\"\r\n\r\nAs such, I am requesting the CIA release all records not already released about Mr. Ellsworth. You may exclude the previously released Washington Post article from this request.\r\n\r\nThere is a compelling public interest in releasing this information: between 1977 and 1979, Mr. Ellsworth attended events at the White House and hosted a luncheon for First Lady Rosalynn Carter. Any association with a sitting president, or the CIA, for that matter, would be a subject of public concern.\r\n\r\nThis information has already been requested at least once in the past: FOIA request F-2018-01557, for information pertaining to \"JOHN CLIFFORD ELLSWORTH [1946-1994]\", was opened on May 9, 2018, per the CIA's 2018 FOIA case log.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. Please advise if fees will exceed this amount so I might make an arrangement for requesting the records. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to Dr. Harris Marshall Chadwell (July 20, 1898 \u2014 June 3, 1980).\r\n\r\nDr. Chadwell served as the Division Chief for Divisions 11 and 19 at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) and later the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) between 1940 and 1946; Associate Director of the Rockefeller Foundation's Natural Sciences Division between 1947 and 1948; Deputy Manager of the New York office of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) between 1949 and 1950; and Assistance Director of the Office of Scientific Intelligence at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) between 1950 and 1955.\r\n\r\nThree of the these agencies\u2014the NDRC/OSRD, AEC, and CIA\u2014would have required Internal Security checks by the FBI to clear Dr. Chadwell for government service. As such, I am requesting all FBI records generated during these reviews and any other records created at any point related to Dr. Chadwell.\r\n\r\nDr. Chadwell is a figure of ongoing public interest. While working for the CIA, Dr. Chadwell was formative in the agency convening the Robertson Panel, a scientific committee established in 1952 to review the United States Air Force's research into unidentified flying objects; he lobbied Director of Central Intelligence Walter Bedell Smith to create the group, worked with panel head Howard P. Robertson to select its members,  and served as an associate member and agency liaison to the group. Dr. Chadwell's involvement with the Robertson Panel is public knowledge thanks to disclosure by the CIA in its academic journal, \"Studies in Intelligence\", in November 1997. A copy of the article by Gerald Haines, \"CIA's Role in the Study of UFOs, 1947-90\", can be found here: https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/cia-role-study-UFOs.pdf\r\n\r\nProof of death is not required as Dr. Chadwell's date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records related to all above referenced committees, agencies, and organizations.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver would be appropriate for the reasons stated above.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100.

Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863 (2015).\r\n\r\nNISSEN AFFIDAVIT AND ALL DEVICE SEARCH REQUIRED\r\n\r\nPursuant to Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863 (2015), and its progeny, this request specifically includes all responsive public records contained on personal devices or personal accounts (including personal cell phones, text/SMS/MMS, personal email accounts, cloud storage, instant messaging apps, and social media accounts) of any agency employee, official, or contractor where public business may have been conducted.\r\n\r\nTo comply with this requirement, please:\r\n\r\nConduct a comprehensive all-device search, including both agency-issued and personally owned devices/accounts used for public business.\r\n\r\nRequire each potentially responsive custodian to execute a Nissen affidavit or sworn certification affirming:\r\n\r\nThat they conducted a diligent search of all personal and agency devices/accounts reasonably likely to contain responsive records;\r\n\r\nThe methods used to conduct the search (e.g., search terms, accounts checked, device types); and\r\n\r\nWhether any responsive records were located, preserved, and produced.\r\n\r\nProduce all responsive records located in such searches along with the executed affidavits.\r\n\r\nFailure to obtain and provide sworn Nissen affidavits or equivalent certifications from custodians may constitute an incomplete search in violation of RCW 42.56.520 (requirement for a reasonable and adequate search) and may expose the agency to relief under RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nFORMAT OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPlease provide the video recordings in their original, native digital format (e.g., .mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, .wmv, .webm, or platform-native format).\r\n\r\nFiles should be delivered unedited and uncut, preserving all metadata (timestamps, file properties, source identifiers).\r\n\r\nDeliver the records by direct electronic means: either (a) direct email attachment where feasible, or (b) a direct, no-password, no-registration-required download link hosted by your agency.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDIGITAL COMPRESSION AND FILE MINIMIZATION REQUESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.080(2), please provide all responsive electronic records in the fewest number of individual files, preserving native formats wherever possible. Where appropriate, please use free digital compression (.zip or equivalent) to consolidate responsive records into the smallest number of installments for efficiency and economy.\r\n\r\nThis approach reduces agency burden, promotes prompt disclosure, and minimizes potential costs to the requestor, consistent with the Public Records Act\u2019s directive that agencies provide records in the most \u201creasonably locatable form\u201d and \u201cfullest assistance to requestors.\u201d See RCW 42.56.100 (agency duty to adopt reasonable rules for providing fullest assistance); RCW 42.56.120(2)(b) (fees must reflect actual costs, not used to discourage access).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have consistently held that agencies must facilitate access in a practical, non-burdensome manner. See Fisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014) (agencies must provide records in a usable format when reasonably feasible); Mechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009) (PRA is to be liberally construed in favor of disclosure). Producing consolidated, digitally compressed files satisfies these obligations by reducing unnecessary fragmentation and excess per-page charges.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I request that each installment be produced as a single compressed .zip file (or as few as technically necessary), containing all responsive records in native format, to ensure both compliance with RCW 42.56 and an economical calculation of any applicable public records fees.\r\n\r\nUSE OF THIRD PARTY PORTALS NOT MANDATORY\r\n\r\nPlease note that under Washington\u2019s Public Records Act, use of a third-party \u201cportal\u201d is not mandatory for requestors. Agencies may not condition access to records on the creation of an account, the use of a login, or the acceptance of third-party vendor terms.\r\n\r\nThird-party portals (such as GovQA, NextRequest, JustFOIA, or similar systems) often:\r\n\r\nRequire account creation or login credentials;\r\n\r\nRestrict downloads, viewing times, or re-access;\r\n\r\nRemove or disable links after a limited period;\r\n\r\nPlace records behind commercial platforms operated by for-profit corporations.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions unlawfully burden and condition access to public records. The Public Records Act forbids agencies from imposing access barriers beyond those authorized by statute.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080(2): An agency \u201cshall not deny a request for identifiable public records solely on the basis that the request is overbroad.\u201d Agencies must provide the \u201cfullest assistance\u201d and \u201cmost timely possible action\u201d to requestors.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.550(1): Courts are directed to liberally construe the PRA to ensure access and strictly construe exemptions against withholding.\r\n\r\nFisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014): Agencies must produce records in a \u201creasonably usable format when feasible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009): PRA is to be liberally construed in favor of disclosure and cannot be restricted by agency practices.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I respectfully decline use of any third-party portal. Please provide all responsive records via:\r\n\r\nDirect electronic email attachment to this requestor\u2019s address, or\r\n\r\nA direct, open (no password, no registration required) cloud-based download link hosted by your agency.\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION ON THIRD PARTY VENDORS\r\n\r\nDo not register this requestor with, nor direct this requestor to, any third-party commercial portal, including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA (a Granicus Corporation), NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA, FOIADirect, or any similar online service.\r\n\r\nDo not transmit any portion of this request, or responsive records, to any for-profit vendor or portal. Doing so would unlawfully condition access to public records and contravene both RCW 42.56.080 and RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being submitted via email, consistent with Washington\u2019s Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080(2) provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\u201cAgencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency\u2019s normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency-provided form or web page.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nA request submitted by email is a valid, enforceable method of making a PRA request.\r\n\r\nAgencies may recommend, but cannot require, the use of an online portal or official form.\r\n\r\nAny refusal to honor this request as submitted would directly conflict with RCW 42.56.080 and the agency\u2019s duty under RCW 42.56.100 to provide the \u201cfullest assistance to requestors\u201d and adopt reasonable rules that do not \u201cunreasonably hinder or delay\u201d access.\r\n\r\nWashington courts have emphasized that the PRA must be liberally construed in favor of disclosure and access, and that agencies cannot impose unauthorized barriers:\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009) (\u201cThe PRA is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure of public records.\u201d).\r\n\r\nFisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014) (records must be produced in a reasonably usable format when feasible).\r\n\r\nNissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863, 875 (2015) (the PRA is to be interpreted liberally to promote access and accountability).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this request is to be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email, as submitted. Should the agency fail to process this request in compliance with statute, relief will be sought pursuant to RCW 42.56.550 in the form of judicial review, penalties, and attorney\u2019s fees.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log.\r\n\r\nThe log must:\r\n\r\n* Identify the valid legal reason (statutory citation) for each exemption;\r\n* Specify the location of each redaction within the record produced (via footnote, coded reference, or margin notation);\r\n* State the number of pages or records withheld in their entirety, if any; and\r\n* Demonstrate that only the **minimal exempt portion** of any record has been withheld, as required by law.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Public Records Act requires agencies to justify each withholding or redaction:\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.210(3): \u201cAgency responses refusing, in whole or in part, inspection of any public record shall include a statement of the specific exemption authorizing the withholding of the record (or part) and a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record withheld.\u201d\r\nRCW 42.56.210(1): Exemptions must be narrowly construed.\r\n\r\nWashington courts have repeatedly enforced this duty:\r\n\r\nRental Housing Ass\u2019n of Puget Sound v. City of Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 538 (2009): Agencies must provide specific explanations for each exemption; conclusory or vague justifications are insufficient.\r\nSanders v. State*, 169 Wn.2d 827, 845 (2010): \u201cThe burden of proof is on the agency to establish that refusal to permit public inspection and copying is in accordance with a statute.\u201d\r\nResident Action Council v. Seattle Housing Auth.* 177 Wn.2d 417, 433 (2013): Agencies must disclose the non-exempt portions*of records and cannot withhold more than necessary.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request that your agency provide an itemized exemption log with each installment of records produced, in compliance with RCW 42.56.210(3) and the above case law, ensuring transparency and accountability in the redaction process.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nCommercial Purpose Declaration\r\n\r\nThis public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose. The Washington State Public Records Act (PRA) prohibits agencies from disclosing \u201clists of individuals\u201d for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.070(8) states:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency to give, sell, or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nThis request does not seek a \u201clist of individuals.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is not made for any commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThis declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56.070(8) regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nWarning: The PRA does not authorize agencies to require requestors to complete additional \u201ccommercial purpose declarations\u201d when the request does not seek a list of individuals. Such requirements improperly condition access to public records in violation of RCW 42.56.080(2) (requests must be honored by mail or email, no official format required) and RCW 42.56.100 (agencies must provide the fullest assistance to requestors and may not adopt rules that unreasonably hinder or delay access).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have consistently rejected agency attempts to impose conditions not found in statute:\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009): The PRA is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure; agencies cannot erect unauthorized barriers.\r\n\r\nSEIU 925 v. University of Washington, 193 Wn.2d 860, 875 (2019): The PRA is to be liberally construed to promote access, and exemptions must be narrowly applied.\r\n\r\nTherefore, no additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this request. Any attempt to impose such a requirement would be an unlawful restriction of rights under RCW 42.56.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 (Retention of Public Records) makes clear that public records are subject to retention schedules, and that unlawful destruction can constitute a crime.\r\n\r\nRCW 40.16.010 and RCW 40.16.020 criminalize the unlawful mutilation, destruction, or concealment of public records.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.100 expressly prohibits an agency from destroying any public record after a public records request has been made for that record, even if the record would otherwise be scheduled for lawful destruction.\r\n\r\nIn addition, agencies have heightened retention obligations when litigation is reasonably anticipated. Records potentially relevant to actual or anticipated litigation must be preserved until both the public records request and the litigation have been fully resolved.\r\n\r\nLegal Consequences of Premature Destruction\r\n\r\nIn Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989), the Court of Appeals held that an agency violates the Public Records Act and is subject to attorneys\u2019 fees and statutory penalties when it destroys responsive records after receiving a public records request.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, it is not a PRA violation if a record was destroyed prior to the agency\u2019s receipt of a request, provided the destruction was lawful under retention schedules. See Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have emphasized that the Public Records Act (RCW 42.56) and the state\u2019s records retention laws (RCW 40.14) are separate but complementary. Agencies must comply with both.\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nYour agency must preserve all potentially responsive records immediately upon receipt of this request.\r\n\r\nNo responsive records may be altered, deleted, or destroyed until this request has been fully resolved and any related litigation has been lifted.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful destruction of responsive records may expose the agency and its officials to criminal liability (RCW 40.16), civil penalties, and mandatory attorneys\u2019 fees (RCW 42.56.550(4)).\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Please do not use third-party portals that require creating an account or logging in. A single or series of .zip files is fine.\r\n\r\nIf any records cannot be produced in the above formats, please produce them in their native format with associated metadata intact.\r\n\r\n3) Metadata Requested\r\n\r\nWhere reasonably available, please include customary metadata fields such as: From, To, CC, BCC, Subject, Sent/Received Date-Time (with timezone/UTC), Message-ID, Conversation/Thread-ID, file names, file sizes, hash values (if held), and folder/location paths.\r\n\r\n4) Search Details & Preservation\r\n\r\nPlease identify the systems searched (Exchange/Outlook/Office 365, Teams, mobile devices, MDM archives, JustFOIA/CivicPlus admin, helpdesk, file shares) and the custodians.\r\n\r\nPlease describe the search methods/terms used.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive sources were not searched or are no longer available, please explain why and what preservation steps were taken.\r\n\r\n5) Withholding, Redaction, and Exemptions\r\n\r\nIf you withhold or redact anything, identify the specific exemption under RCW 42.56 and provide a brief written explanation of how it applies to each withheld/redacted portion (RCW 42.56.210(3)). Please produce all segregable portions. For any records withheld in full, please provide an exemption/withholding log describing: date, author/recipient (to the extent disclosable), subject or general description, format, page count, and the precise exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\n6) Installments & Estimates\r\n\r\nPlease provide:\r\n\r\nAn initial acknowledgment within five business days (RCW 42.56.520) with a reasonable time estimate for each installment, and\r\n\r\nA cost estimate if fees are anticipated (please itemize and explain).\r\n\r\nNISSEN AFFIDAVIT AND ALL DEVICE SEARCH REQUIRED\r\n\r\nPursuant to Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863 (2015), and its progeny, this request specifically includes all responsive public records contained on personal devices or personal accounts (including personal cell phones, text/SMS/MMS, personal email accounts, cloud storage, instant messaging apps, and social media accounts) of any agency employee, official, or contractor where public business may have been conducted.\r\n\r\nTo comply with this requirement, please:\r\n\r\nConduct a comprehensive all-device search, including both agency-issued and personally owned devices/accounts used for public business.\r\n\r\nRequire each potentially responsive custodian to execute a Nissen affidavit or sworn certification affirming:\r\n\r\nThat they conducted a diligent search of all personal and agency devices/accounts reasonably likely to contain responsive records;\r\n\r\nThe methods used to conduct the search (e.g., search terms, accounts checked, device types); and\r\n\r\nWhether any responsive records were located, preserved, and produced.\r\n\r\nProduce all responsive records located in such searches along with the executed affidavits.\r\n\r\nFailure to obtain and provide sworn Nissen affidavits or equivalent certifications from custodians may constitute an incomplete search in violation of RCW 42.56.520 (requirement for a reasonable and adequate search) and may expose the agency to relief under RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDIGITAL COMPRESSION AND FILE MINIMIZATION REQUESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.080(2), please provide all responsive electronic records in the fewest number of individual files, preserving native formats wherever possible. Where appropriate, please use free digital compression (.zip or equivalent) to consolidate responsive records into the smallest number of installments for efficiency and economy.\r\n\r\nThis approach reduces agency burden, promotes prompt disclosure, and minimizes potential costs to the requestor, consistent with the Public Records Act\u2019s directive that agencies provide records in the most \u201creasonably locatable form\u201d and \u201cfullest assistance to requestors.\u201d See RCW 42.56.100 (agency duty to adopt reasonable rules for providing fullest assistance); RCW 42.56.120(2)(b) (fees must reflect actual costs, not used to discourage access).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have consistently held that agencies must facilitate access in a practical, non-burdensome manner. See Fisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014) (agencies must provide records in a usable format when reasonably feasible); Mechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009) (PRA is to be liberally construed in favor of disclosure). Producing consolidated, digitally compressed files satisfies these obligations by reducing unnecessary fragmentation and excess per-page charges.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I request that each installment be produced as a single compressed .zip file (or as few as technically necessary), containing all responsive records in native format, to ensure both compliance with RCW 42.56 and an economical calculation of any applicable public records fees.\r\n\r\nUSE OF THIRD PARTY PORTALS NOT MANDATORY\r\n\r\nPlease note that under Washington\u2019s Public Records Act, use of a third-party \u201cportal\u201d is not mandatory for requestors. Agencies may not condition access to records on the creation of an account, the use of a login, or the acceptance of third-party vendor terms.\r\n\r\nThird-party portals (such as GovQA, NextRequest, JustFOIA, or similar systems) often:\r\n\r\nRequire account creation or login credentials;\r\n\r\nRestrict downloads, viewing times, or re-access;\r\n\r\nRemove or disable links after a limited period;\r\n\r\nPlace records behind commercial platforms operated by for-profit corporations.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions unlawfully burden and condition access to public records. The Public Records Act forbids agencies from imposing access barriers beyond those authorized by statute.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080(2): An agency \u201cshall not deny a request for identifiable public records solely on the basis that the request is overbroad.\u201d Agencies must provide the \u201cfullest assistance\u201d and \u201cmost timely possible action\u201d to requestors.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.550(1): Courts are directed to liberally construe the PRA to ensure access and strictly construe exemptions against withholding.\r\n\r\nFisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014): Agencies must produce records in a \u201creasonably usable format when feasible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009): PRA is to be liberally construed in favor of disclosure and cannot be restricted by agency practices.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I respectfully decline use of any third-party portal. Please provide all responsive records via:\r\n\r\nDirect electronic email attachment to this requestor\u2019s address, or\r\n\r\nA direct, open (no password, no registration required) cloud-based download link hosted by your agency.\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION ON THIRD PARTY VENDORS\r\n\r\nDo not register this requestor with, nor direct this requestor to, any third-party commercial portal, including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA (a Granicus Corporation), NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA, FOIADirect, or any similar online service.\r\n\r\nDo not transmit any portion of this request, or responsive records, to any for-profit vendor or portal. Doing so would unlawfully condition access to public records and contravene both RCW 42.56.080 and RCW 42.56.550.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being submitted via email, consistent with Washington\u2019s Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080(2) provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\u201cAgencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency\u2019s normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency-provided form or web page.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nA request submitted by email is a valid, enforceable method of making a PRA request.\r\n\r\nAgencies may recommend, but cannot require, the use of an online portal or official form.\r\n\r\nAny refusal to honor this request as submitted would directly conflict with RCW 42.56.080 and the agency\u2019s duty under RCW 42.56.100 to provide the \u201cfullest assistance to requestors\u201d and adopt reasonable rules that do not \u201cunreasonably hinder or delay\u201d access.\r\n\r\nWashington courts have emphasized that the PRA must be liberally construed in favor of disclosure and access, and that agencies cannot impose unauthorized barriers:\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009) (\u201cThe PRA is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure of public records.\u201d).\r\n\r\nFisher Broadcasting-Seattle TV LLC v. City of Seattle, 180 Wn.2d 515, 528 (2014) (records must be produced in a reasonably usable format when feasible).\r\n\r\nNissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wn.2d 863, 875 (2015) (the PRA is to be interpreted liberally to promote access and accountability).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this request is to be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email, as submitted. Should the agency fail to process this request in compliance with statute, relief will be sought pursuant to RCW 42.56.550 in the form of judicial review, penalties, and attorney\u2019s fees.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log. \r\n\r\nThe log must:\r\n\r\n* Identify the valid legal reason (statutory citation) for each exemption;\r\n* Specify the location of each redaction within the record produced (via footnote, coded reference, or margin notation);\r\n* State the number of pages or records withheld in their entirety, if any; and\r\n* Demonstrate that only the **minimal exempt portion** of any record has been withheld, as required by law.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Public Records Act requires agencies to justify each withholding or redaction:\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.210(3): \u201cAgency responses refusing, in whole or in part, inspection of any public record shall include a statement of the specific exemption authorizing the withholding of the record (or part) and a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record withheld.\u201d\r\nRCW 42.56.210(1): Exemptions must be narrowly construed.\r\n\r\nWashington courts have repeatedly enforced this duty:\r\n\r\nRental Housing Ass\u2019n of Puget Sound v. City of Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 538 (2009): Agencies must provide specific explanations for each exemption; conclusory or vague justifications are insufficient.\r\nSanders v. State*, 169 Wn.2d 827, 845 (2010): \u201cThe burden of proof is on the agency to establish that refusal to permit public inspection and copying is in accordance with a statute.\u201d\r\nResident Action Council v. Seattle Housing Auth.* 177 Wn.2d 417, 433 (2013): Agencies must disclose the non-exempt portions*of records and cannot withhold more than necessary.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request that your agency provide an itemized exemption log with each installment of records produced, in compliance with RCW 42.56.210(3) and the above case law, ensuring transparency and accountability in the redaction process.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nCommercial Purpose Declaration\r\n\r\nThis public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose. The Washington State Public Records Act (PRA) prohibits agencies from disclosing \u201clists of individuals\u201d for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.070(8) states:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency to give, sell, or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nThis request does not seek a \u201clist of individuals.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis request is not made for any commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThis declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56.070(8) regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nWarning: The PRA does not authorize agencies to require requestors to complete additional \u201ccommercial purpose declarations\u201d when the request does not seek a list of individuals. Such requirements improperly condition access to public records in violation of RCW 42.56.080(2) (requests must be honored by mail or email, no official format required) and RCW 42.56.100 (agencies must provide the fullest assistance to requestors and may not adopt rules that unreasonably hinder or delay access).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have consistently rejected agency attempts to impose conditions not found in statute:\r\n\r\nMechling v. City of Monroe, 152 Wn. App. 830, 841 (2009): The PRA is a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure; agencies cannot erect unauthorized barriers.\r\n\r\nSEIU 925 v. University of Washington, 193 Wn.2d 860, 875 (2019): The PRA is to be liberally construed to promote access, and exemptions must be narrowly applied.\r\n\r\nTherefore, no additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this request. Any attempt to impose such a requirement would be an unlawful restriction of rights under RCW 42.56.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 (Retention of Public Records) makes clear that public records are subject to retention schedules, and that unlawful destruction can constitute a crime.\r\n\r\nRCW 40.16.010 and RCW 40.16.020 criminalize the unlawful mutilation, destruction, or concealment of public records.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.100 expressly prohibits an agency from destroying any public record after a public records request has been made for that record, even if the record would otherwise be scheduled for lawful destruction.\r\n\r\nIn addition, agencies have heightened retention obligations when litigation is reasonably anticipated. Records potentially relevant to actual or anticipated litigation must be preserved until both the public records request and the litigation have been fully resolved.\r\n\r\nLegal Consequences of Premature Destruction\r\n\r\nIn Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989), the Court of Appeals held that an agency violates the Public Records Act and is subject to attorneys\u2019 fees and statutory penalties when it destroys responsive records after receiving a public records request.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, it is not a PRA violation if a record was destroyed prior to the agency\u2019s receipt of a request, provided the destruction was lawful under retention schedules. See Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).\r\n\r\nWashington courts have emphasized that the Public Records Act (RCW 42.56) and the state\u2019s records retention laws (RCW 40.14) are separate but complementary. Agencies must comply with both.\r\n\r\nAccordingly:\r\n\r\nYour agency must preserve all potentially responsive records immediately upon receipt of this request.\r\n\r\nNo responsive records may be altered, deleted, or destroyed until this request has been fully resolved and any related litigation has been lifted.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful destruction of responsive records may expose the agency and its officials to criminal liability (RCW 40.16), civil penalties, and mandatory attorneys\u2019 fees (RCW 42.56.550(4)).\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",
