A recent Netflix special included the assertion that in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, Pearlman was able to directly call President Bush in order to clear Pearlman's private plane to fly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNews coverage of the Netflix special described this Pearlman/Bush connection as: \r\n\r\n\"However, his (Pearlman's) connections were so significant that he called President George W. Bush to request special permission to allow the members of Natural to fly. Not only did President Bush grant special permission, but he also sent special planes to pick them up in New York. Lou Pearlman was so powerful that he could bypass strict national laws for his personal benefit. Pearlman quite literally defied the attacks on September 11, 2001\u2014not even something as severe as that could stand in his way.\"\r\n\r\nHere's a link to news coverage of the Netflix special:\r\n\r\nhttps://screenrant.com/netflix-dirty-pop-boy-band-scam-documentary-shocking-reveals/\r\n\r\nIf any such documents exist, this is a request for:\r\n\r\nAny correspondence between Lou Pearlman and President Bush \r\nAny correspondence from Governor Jeb Bush that mentions Pearlman \r\nAny record of a phone call between Pearlman and Bush in the aftermath of 9/11\r\nAny record of President Bush's effort to assist Pearlman's flight\r\nAny photographs of Pearlman and President Bush or Laura Bush together \r\n\r\nThank you for the Bush library's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working with you on this request until it reaches resolution.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
