For any such application that was denied, a copy of any records pertaining to the decision to deny the application, including any memoranda or correspondence (including letters, emails, or text messages).\r\n\r\n3. Any communications to or from Nashua's Risk Manager with the words \"Appeal to Heaven\" since January 1, 2024.\r\n\r\n4. Any communications to or from Nashua's Risk Manager with the words \"harmony\" and either \"message\" or \"messages\" since January 1, 2023. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

We are not the records custodian for that office, and will only have responsive records to the extent that such records were sent to or from the Office of the Governor.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, to the extent we have responsive records, we will endeavor to respond to your request. I have broken out our responses/requests for clarification below, corresponding to the separate items in your request:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.\r\nWe do not have records responsive to this request.\r\n\r\n  2.\r\nPlease clarify the scope of this request. First, there are no search terms or keywords identified for this request. Second, the request includes \"communications...to or from...any person employed by the State of Georgia Government, on the one hand, and any elected official...or any member of the staff of an elected official, on the other hand.\" Interpreted literally and applied to the Office of the Governor, this would essentially cover every email sent to or from our office to any state employee, regardless of subject or keywords. This is likely to return thousands of documents and incur significant costs. Please confirm whether this is the intended scope of your request.\r\n\r\n  3.\r\nPlease clarify the scope of this request. Similar to part (2), this request includes \"communications...to or from...any person employed by the State of Georgia Government, on the one hand, and any elected official...or any member of the staff of an elected official, on the other hand.\" With the inclusion of the specified keywords, there are likely to be somewhat fewer responsive documents, but I am not sure whether this is the intended scope.\r\n\r\n     *\r\nTo the extent that this request was intended to cover only communications between employees of or persons associated with the University of Georgia, on the one hand, and the Office of the Governor, on the other, the responsive records would be identical to those provided to you on May 8th (attached).\r\n  4.\r\n\r\n  5.\r\nThere is no request following \"4\" below.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you would like us to interpret this request, and if you wish, provide any additional clarification to your request.

REV. STAT. \u00a7 84-712(4). The Nebraska public records statute allows persons the right to examine public records in the possession of public agencies during normal agency business hours, to make memorandum and abstracts from those public records, and to obtain copies of public records in certain circumstances. The statute do not require a public agency to review documents and create abstracts or other lists, to answer questions, or to create documents that do not otherwise exist. See NEB.REV.STAT. \u00a7 84-712. Although the Nebraska public records statutes provided for access to public documents, such access is not absolute. The statutes also provide for exceptions to disclosures by express and special provisions; there are 21 categories of documents that may be kept confidential from the public at the discretion of the agency involved. See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 84-712.05. Your request is denied in part and approved in part. Your request for the various administrative social media settings Facebook and Twitter, and the content within them is denied.\u00a0 Even though the social media sites are open to the public for viewing and posting of comments, the information you are requesting is not for public dissemination pursuant to NEB.REV.STAT. 84-712.05. The Public Information Office (PIO) manages the Omaha Police Department's social media sites.\u00a0 I have been told they do have a list of approximately 200 individuals blocked and banned from the early onset of our use of social media.\u00a0 I am told that no one has been blocked or banned from our social media sites in several years.\u00a0 We value the foundation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and as such we do not encourage blocking or banning citizens from our social media sites. Your request for the list of banned and blocked people and pages is denied, as this information is not for public dissemination pursuant to NEB.REV.STAT. 84-712.05. As previously mentioned, the PIO manages the Omaha Police Department's social media sites.\u00a0 Your request for a copy of the 'Page Role' is denied pursuant to NEB.REV.STAT. 84-712.05. Your request for the policy concerning use or interaction within Facebook and Twitter can be found by clicking on the following link: https://public.powerdms.com/OPDEP1/tree/documents/2347571 Section 84-712.03 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes may grant you the right to administrative or judicial review of this response. Please consult the statute for further information. Chief of Police Todd Schmaderer is the sole entity responsible for denying a portion of your request. Thank you for your patience with this request.\u00a0 If you have any questions about the legal basis for this response, please contact me at 402.444.6089. Sincerely, Anna",

Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at dillon@muckrock.com, or by phone at (267) 314-7952.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDillon Bergin",

\r\n\r\n--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n Public Records Request: P003584-042124 \r\n \r\n   \r\n  \r\n RE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of April 21, 2024 Reference # P003584-042124 Dear Requester, I am writing in response to your public records request of April 21, 2024, in which you requested the following: Any records relating to reports and complaints filled by researchers (students and faculty) about concern to animal health and safety across the University of Wisconsin schools including the School of Medicine and Public Health, the School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences from January, 1, 2023- present day. Access the Public Records Center to download the responsive records.  Under the Wisconsin Public Records Laws, records custodians must carefully weigh the competing public interests involved when deciding to release any record in their possession.\u00a0 Custodians begin with a presumption of complete public access to such records.\u00a0 However, custodians must consider whether inspection of the record could result in harm to the public interest that would outweigh the benefits of such inspection.\u00a0 When such harm substantially outweighs the benefits of public inspection, such records, or portions thereof, must remain confidential. Additional information has been provided with this request to inform the requestor of steps taken to address complaints included in this reply. Material not related to the steps taken in response to these complaints has been removed from the meeting minutes provided. This is not a redaction of records. The additional records provided are not responsive to the request; they are merely something the university has chosen to provide for additional information. Personally identifiable information of individuals engaged in or supporting animal research: Pursuant to an application of the balancing test inherent in Wisconsin\u2019s public records law, we have made the specific determination that the public interest in safeguarding and preventing the harassment of individuals involved in animal research outweighs the public interest in compelled disclosure of their personally identifying information. Furthermore, by applying the balancing test inherent in the public records law, we have determined that the public policy interest in maintaining the university\u2019s competitive position outweighs the interest in disclosing the personally identifiable information of our employees, students, collaborators, and other supporters of animal research. This determination aligns with Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.85(1)(e), permitting the closure of publicly held meetings for competitive reasons. We\u2019ve specifically determined that disclosing personally identifiable information about individuals engaged in or supporting animal research would jeopardize the university's competitive standing (Cf. Wis. Stat. \u00a719.35(1)(a), incorporating public policy expressed in \u00a719.85(1)(e).). For instance, revealing such information could lead to threats or harassment, potentially prompting talented staff or students to seek employment or educational opportunities elsewhere. Additionally, it could strain vital research partnerships. The departure of skilled personnel or students would diminish the university's standing compared to its competitors, hindering its ability to serve the State effectively. The considerable public interest in the ongoing social and economic benefits stemming from university research outweighs any marginal interest in the specific names contained in these records. We have also considered that any public interest in these records is fully satisfied by the substantial information being released, and not harmed by redactions to the identity of specific persons. References to animal research locations (locations and housing) and full denial of a video: Applying the public records law balancing test, we determined that the public interest in protecting university research facilities, activities, and personnel from criminal interference, disorderly conduct, vandalism and other disruption of lawful research and academic activities outweighs the public interest in knowing the exact locations of research animals and facilities. Specific locations have been denied and in the case of one complaint that included a video, the video is denied in total. There is no means to redact the video to a point where it could be unidentifiable of location. The complaint itself is provided redacted for identifiable information only. This determination is supported by Wis. Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 16.851 and 19.36(9), which shield plans and specifications of state-owned and state-leased buildings from disclosure, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding such information. Additionally, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.85(1)(d) permits the closure of meetings to discuss crime prevention strategies, highlighting the public policy favoring nondisclosure in the interest of preventing criminal activities. The university is required to inform you that to the extent this amounts to a denial of your request it is subject to review by mandamus under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1)(a) or by application to the attorney general or district attorney pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1)(b). The university has responded to your request and it is now closed. Sincerely, Julie Laundrie Public Records Custodian Office of Compliance University of Wisconsin-Madison   \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Access the Public Records Center to View the Request",

Bronfman Sr.; it also states that some records were destroyed. \r\n\r\nThe pages and quick turnaround are appreciated. However, I wish to implore the Bureau to continue searching for records and respond accordingly. Please take note of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n1) My own request included an explicit request for \"destruction or transfer slips\" in the case records were destroyed or transferred to NARA; this was not fulfilled in the prior FOIPA response.\r\n\r\n2) I am led to believe that the Bureau has records referencing or pertinent to Bronfman that are much more recent than the last records provided. Attached, please find reference to evidence and testimony from the trial of Keith Raniere in Eastern District of New York that there was an intrusion into Mr. Bronfman's electronic mail correspondence. By reasonable inference, the Bureau should possess records of the investigation into this intrusion.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nT. McElwee",

Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2020.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

For instance, devices and access points purchased by your agency but never deployed or provided to anyone, lets say sitting on a shelf new in the box in an agency warehouse, would NOT be a responsive record requested.\r\n\r\nHowever a 5 year old my-fi hotspot provided to an agency employee, say a vice superintendent for working remotely from home WOULD be a responsive record requested.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nRELEVANT PORTION OF ORIGINAL REQUEST:\r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2022.\r\n\r\nThese records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2022.\r\n\r\n2. Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the year 2021.\r\n\r\nThese records should include all invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2021.\r\n\r\n3.

The number of Application for Transportation Service requests, aka \"White Forms\", submitted; \r\n2. The number of students who have accepted transportation reimbursement stipends; \r\n3. Special Education Students Missing Active Transportation Request - anonymized aggregated students including type of transportation. RESPONSE: Documents responsive to parts one (1) and two (2) of your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests. Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPart three (3) of this request fails to cite an existing record for review. Note that the district does not maintain data reflecting counts of \u201cSpecial Education Students Missing Active Transporting Request\u201d in the same record or database as data reflecting \u201ctype of transportation\u201d. In order to respond to that portion of the request, the district would be required to pull data from multiple sources maintained by different departments, conduct original research and analysis to join to the two datasets, and then manually combine them in order to create a new record, not maintained in the normal course of business and outside the scope of the FOIA. \r\nThe requirements of the FOIA apply to public records \u201chaving been prepared by or for, or having been or being used by, received by, or in the possession of, or under the control of any public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/2(c)]. Accordingly, and as determined in Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989), the FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. \r\nAdditionally, a FOIA request must reasonably identify a record(s) for review and not \u201ca general request for data, information and statistics to be gleaned generally from documents which have not been created and which the agency does not generally create or require.\u201d [ Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989)]. Additionally, \u201cA requester is entitled only to records that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.\u201d [ Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1922)] Additionally, Section 1\u00a0of the\u00a0FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part\u00a0of\u00a0any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\"\u00a0In accordance with Section 1\u00a0of\u00a0Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. Personally identifiable student record information is exempt from release in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.

However, we may be able to provide some of what you're looking for in terms of aggregate numbers of requests and requests status. We may have difficulty sorting records into quarterly buckets, as we don't typically track things on a quarterly basis at CDPH (we are a governmental institution and as such do not pay taxes). Happy to work with you to narrow or clarify this request. Feel free to call me if desired at 312-718-1410.\r\nThanks, \r\nJacob Martin \r\nChicago Department of Public Health",

These logs will give you open and close dates for each request as well as request status. For requests dating back before that time, I have records of open and close dates but I do not have an updated log of status for each request.

        "communication": "Dear FBI:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act. Please produce all records related to Esther Cooper Jackson, a self-proclaimed Black communist revolutionary. Ms. Jackson was born in Arlington, Virginia on Aug. 21, 1917 and died on August 23, 2022 in Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nOTHER NAMES USED: The subject's maiden name was Esther Victoria Cooper. \r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH: \r\n\r\nIn addition to standard practices, please search the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices.\r\n\r\nPlease include a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and things to see if they contain additional records related to Ms. Jackson: (1) James E. Jackson Jr., the subject's husband, (2) Freedomways magazine, which the subject edited, and (3) the Southern Negro Youth Congress, with which the subject was affiliated.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks information that, to my knowledge, is not already in the public domain. Of course, without already knowing what records the Bureau has, I can't say for sure whether those records are already in the public domain or what the public would learn from them; however, because Ms. Jackson has recently died, the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Ms. Jackson was a public figure. News obituaries for Ms. Jackson appeared in the Washington Post and the New York Times, among other publications. According to her obituary in the Washington Post (attached): \r\n\r\n\"Ms. Jackson spent decades on the forefront of the movement for racial justice \u2014 and decades more as a repository of knowledge about the social, political and intellectual movements that helped shape the United States in the 20th century. 'Esther Cooper Jackson\u2019s activism in the Black freedom movement spans over [70 years], and her contributions are nearly impossible to quantify,' Sara Rzeszutek, a professor of history at St. Francis College in Brooklyn and the author of a book about Ms. Jackson\u2019s activism, said in an email.\" \r\n\r\nThus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. \r\n\r\nI am also making this request via MuckRock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that will allow anyone in the world to access all responsive records online for free.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Ms. Jackson has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released before. Again, I cannot be 100% sure if factor is satisfied without already knowing what records the Bureau has. However, given Ms. Jackson's status as a public figure, the Bureau should deem this factor satisfied.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government's surveillance of its critics. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nI would prefer that you produce responsive records electronically if possible: by email attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

        "communication": "FOIA APPEAL: FEE WAIVER\r\nFOIPA Request No.: 1572070-000 (JACKSON, ESTHER COOPER) \r\n\r\nDear OIP:\r\n\r\nI hearby appeal the Bureau's denial of my request for a fee waiver. \r\n\r\n1. The Bureau states that my request failed to meet at least one of the four public interest factors, but it does not say which factor or factors I failed to satisfy or why. This alone is reason enough to reverse the Bureau's decision, because it makes it impossible for the requestor to meaningfully respond to the denial\u2014rendering the denial arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and a denial of due process.\r\n\r\n2.  My request meets the legal standard for a fee waiver. The subject of the request was a public figure, with news obituaries of her death appearing in major newspapers. Responsive records will be of great interest to historians, political activists, scholars, and all who care about the government's surveillance of political dissidents. I am making this request via MuckRock.com, which will automatically make all responsive records available to the general public for free. There is simply no reason to deny this fee waiver.  \r\n\r\n3. I incorporate by reference the additional arguments I made in my initial request for a fee waiver.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this appeal.\r\n\r\nMost sincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

CBP-FO-2023-115940 \r\nCBP FOIA attempted to call you on 10/12/2023 to discuss your cases, however, the number did not work and kept getting a busy signal. You did not provide custodians for your email searches and to continue processing your request this information is needed. However, CBP FOIA used the top three leadership names in the Rio Grande sector as your custodians so we can continue your search.Provisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations. By submitting your request, you have agreed to pay up to $25.00 in applicable processing fees, if any fees associated with your request exceed this amount, CBP shall contact you; however, the first 100 pages are free.  Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, CBP processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.  Although CBP\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). Please note that due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, and a current backlog, it may take 6-9 months to receive a response to your FOIA request.

This is not a final response. CBP FOIA will continue to review potentially responsive records and/or conduct additional searches during this time. You will be notified in future correspondence of the disposition of each interim release and will be provided a final response prior to the closing of your case. In the event records are released, you may be provided additional instructions detailing the method used to retrieve the information via your SecureRelease account. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nThis completes an incremental review of your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 90 K St, NE MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150.  The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2023-115941 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date our final response is issued, following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via SecureRelease.  If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.

Upon initial review of your request, we have determined that the following documents can be found on the internet at the following link: https://www.cbp.gov/document/foia-record/texas-buoy-barrier \r\nYou may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account], mailing a letter to 90 K St, NE MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150.

The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.

Box 3371\r\nTampa, FL 33601\r\n\r\nSubject: Freedom of Information Act Request for Body Camera Footage and Related Communications\r\n\r\nDear Public Information Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing as a freelance journalist under the provisions of the Florida Sunshine Law and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), seeking access to records related to the law enforcement response at the University of South Florida during the protest on May 1, 2024. This event, part of the Free Palestine and Resistance Movement against Israeli aggression, is referenced in your press release titled \"HCSO Assists USF Police Department Following Unsanctioned Protest.\"\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\r\nDigital Documents:\r\nBody Camera Footage: Complete recordings from body-worn cameras of all officers engaged from the beginning to the end of their deployment at the protest. Legal support: ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012) affirms the public\u2019s right to record public officials in public settings, which supports the disclosure of body camera footage.\r\nRadio Transmissions: All audio recordings and transcripts of radio communications involving law enforcement personnel during the protest. Legal support: Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978) indicates the public interest in accessing law enforcement communications for transparency.\r\nText Communications: All SMS and instant messages sent to and from officers concerning the enforcement activities at the protest. Legal support: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998) supports the release of communications to ensure transparency in governmental operations.\r\nAerial Footage: All video recordings from helicopters, drones, or any other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used during the protest. Legal support: Electronic Frontier Foundation v. Department of Transportation, 2015 (finding that aerial surveillance footage is subject to disclosure under FOIA to allow public analysis of governmental surveillance practices).\r\nPhysical Documents:\r\nIncident Reports and Briefings: All written reports, memos, and briefing documents pertaining to the law enforcement activities during the protest. Legal support: Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989) supports the disclosure of law enforcement records for public scrutiny.\r\nOperational Plans: Documents detailing the strategies and guidelines used for managing the protest. Legal support: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978) demonstrates the public's right to understand the strategic operations of public authorities.\r\nLegal Precedents and Public Interest Justification:\r\n\r\nThe requested information is of significant public interest, particularly concerning government operations at public protests and the specific enforcement tactics employed against movements advocating for international human rights and resistance against oppression. The release of these records will enhance public understanding and facilitate informed community oversight.\r\n\r\nFees and Document Delivery:\r\n\r\nPlease inform me of any potential fees associated with the processing of this request. I request a waiver of all fees as this disclosure is primarily in the public interest, contributing substantially to the understanding of government operations and is not for commercial purposes.

Legal support: Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978) indicates the public interest in accessing law enforcement communications for transparency.\r\nText Communications: All SMS and instant messages sent to and from officers concerning the enforcement activities at the protest.

Box 3371 \r\nTampa, FL 33601 \r\n\r\nSubject: Freedom of Information Act Request for Body Camera Footage and Related Communications \r\n\r\nDear Public Information Officer, \r\n\r\nI am writing as a freelance journalist under the provisions of the Florida Sunshine Law and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), seeking access to records related to the law enforcement response at the University of South Florida during the protest on May 1, 2024. This event, part of the Free Palestine and Resistance Movement against Israeli aggression, is referenced in your press release titled \"HCSO Assists USF Police Department Following Unsanctioned Protest.\" \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\r\nDigital Documents: \r\nBody Camera Footage: Complete recordings from body-worn cameras of all officers engaged from the beginning to the end of their deployment at the protest. Legal support: ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012) affirms the public\u2019s right to record public officials in public settings, which supports the disclosure of body camera footage. \r\nRadio Transmissions: All audio recordings and transcripts of radio communications involving law enforcement personnel during the protest. Legal support: Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978) indicates the public interest in accessing law enforcement communications for transparency. \r\nText Communications: All SMS and instant messages sent to and from officers concerning the enforcement activities at the protest. Legal support: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998) supports the release of communications to ensure transparency in governmental operations. \r\nAerial Footage: All video recordings from helicopters, drones, or any other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used during the protest. Legal support: Electronic Frontier Foundation v. Department of Transportation, 2015 (finding that aerial surveillance footage is subject to disclosure under FOIA to allow public analysis of governmental surveillance practices). \r\nPhysical Documents: \r\nIncident Reports and Briefings: All written reports, memos, and briefing documents pertaining to the law enforcement activities during the protest. Legal support: Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989) supports the disclosure of law enforcement records for public scrutiny. \r\nOperational Plans: Documents detailing the strategies and guidelines used for managing the protest. Legal support: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978) demonstrates the public's right to understand the strategic operations of public authorities. \r\nLegal Precedents and Public Interest Justification: \r\n\r\nThe requested information is of significant public interest, particularly concerning government operations at public protests and the specific enforcement tactics employed against movements advocating for international human rights and resistance against oppression.

On September 13, 2023, I sent the follow to you via email. Your request is #18 in my processing queue.  I am still working on a litigation case, which has delayed my attention on other cases.  If I can find time to make progress on your request without delaying requirements for the litigation I will do so.  However, I still anticipate not being able to focus on your request until the end of late November or early December 2023.  The status is still the same as mentioned on September 13, 2023.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour request is now #17 in the queue. I have approximately 148 pages responsive to your request.  This number may change after I finish my review. Please note, I work on requests on a first come first processed basis.  However, I will send you a partial response to you; hopefully, in the next two weeks. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMs. Michelle Moreno\r\n\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\n\r\nShe / Her / Hers\r\n\r\nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service\r\n\r\nLegislative and Public Affairs\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act and Privacy Act\r\n\r\n4700 River Road / Riverdale, MD 20737\r\n\r\nEmail: Michelle.Moreno@USDA.GOV\r\n\r\nPhone: (301) 851-4084\"",
