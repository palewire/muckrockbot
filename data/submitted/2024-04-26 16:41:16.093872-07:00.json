These documents concern the operations and activities of the Medford BLM various employees from HR personnel, Law Enforcement and NEPA planners.

The management of this project area is of the utmost interest to our supporters and readers. I will use the requested information to further the public\u2019s understanding of the BLM management and we will disseminate the information through news channels.\r\n\r\nI also request that you waive any applicable fees because the requested material is clearly in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d This request complies with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 because the furnished information will be used to inform the public of how the federal government is managing vegetation, wildlife and watersheds public lands as well as responding to the protected first amendment right to peacefully protest. These documents concern the operations and activities of the Medford BLM various employees from HR personnel, Law Enforcement and NEPA planners. The release of these documents will enhance the public\u2019s understanding of the BLM management and inform the public as to whether the BLM has complied with its duties. I have no commercial interest in these documents.\r\n\r\nThrough destination these records will allow a reasonably broad audiences to better understand BLM management activities.\r\n\r\nThe requested information is \u201cnew\u201d in that it is currently unavailable to the public. Disclosure of the information will clarify BLM activities concerning resources of public concern.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason the fee waiver is denied, I reserve the right to appeal such decision. However, I anticipate that the BLM will make the requested materials available within the statutorily prescribed period. Access to the records should be granted within twenty working days from your receipt of this request. Failure to respond in a timely manner shall be viewed as a denial of this request. Time is of the essence.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
