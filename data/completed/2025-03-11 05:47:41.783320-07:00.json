On May 20, 2024, your office made a partial release of records, delivered by Matthew Gomez. On June 3, 2024, your office closed the request. On June 5, 2020, your office reopened the request when I pointed out you only provided records responsive to one of the two items I sought. Mr. Gomez subsequently sought a date range for the request. On August 23, 2024, I provided that date range. On August 29, 2024, your office notified me that a search produced more then 200 GB of data. On August 30, 2024, I asked for the metadata from these emails in lieu of the emails themselves. On September 6, 2024, your office informed me your IT department could not provide metadata for the emails. You proposed an alternate search methodology aimed at narrowing the results. I accepted that proposal on September 9, 2024. On December 31, 2024, Yvette Gurule informed me the city was experiencing a high volume of requests, and told me I would not receive these records until they became available. On February 10, 2024, your office sent a similar message. This time, you office informed me that if I didn\u2019t respond by February 14, you would close the request. \r\n\r\nPlease provide all records associated with processing of my IPRA request by these individuals on these dates, as well as any other processing information, including the communications with your IT department regarding metadata.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Specifically:  \r\n\r\nThese reports are completed by the athletic department for the National Collegiate Athletic Association for the fiscal years listed above. This report is a multi-page document that had to be submitted to the NCAA in January. It contains 40+ revenue and expense categories, followed by specific breakdowns of each of those categories, by sport and gender. I am requesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther Reporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that appears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different than the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for Title IX compliance.\r\n\r\nIf your department does not maintain these public records, please let me know who does and include the proper custodian\u2019s name and address.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) on which you rely.  Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Stacey Brook.",

To avoid any unwarranted invasions of privacy, I\u2019m specifically seeking the de-identified, aggregate data annually from January 1, 2020, through January 1, 2025, including the following: \r\n   1. The number of adolescent offenders, as well as juvenile offenders, including those granted youthful offender status, under the age of 18 at the time of the offense.\r\n   2. Offender demographics including: total arrest dispositions, age at the time of offense, race, gender, and county convicted/adjudicated.\r\n   3. If collected in the same data, demographics of the victim including: age, gender, and race.\r\n   4. If collected in the same data, number of petitions filed and status (approved/denied/in progress). \r\nI ask that, if possible, you provide any potentially responsive records as an electronic spreadsheet or searchable database format. Should you deny this request in whole or in part, I ask that you detail your reasons for doing so in writing, citing the applicable statutes.\r\nThis information is being sought in the regular course of newsgathering on behalf of the Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism for dissemination to the general public. \r\nI\u2019m requesting that you waive any fees associated with production of potentially responsive records. Release of this information is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities, specifically how the state and local authorities work together to monitor sex offender status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Trump.\r\n\r\nThis request seeks to clarify the extent of New Rochelle Police Department\u2019s involvement in federal immigration enforcement and whether ICE has made requests, conducted operations, or received assistance from NRPD.\r\n\r\nScope of Request: Specific Records Sought\r\n\r\nI request copies of all relevant records, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Communications Between New Rochelle Police Department and ICE\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of all emails, letters, faxes, text messages, internal memos, and reports exchanged between NRPD officers, detectives, supervisors, or administrative personnel and ICE agents or representatives from January 1, 2025, to the present regarding:\r\n\t\u2022\tRequests for assistance in immigration enforcement operations in New Rochelle.\r\n\t\u2022\tICE detainers or holds placed on individuals arrested or detained by NRPD.\r\n\t\u2022\tJoint operations, task forces, or coordinated efforts between NRPD and ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tPolicy discussions regarding the role of NRPD in federal immigration enforcement.\r\n\t\u2022\tRequests from ICE for personal data, residency information, or surveillance of specific individuals.\r\n\r\n2. New Rochelle Police Department Policies on ICE and Immigration Enforcement\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of all policies, directives, and internal guidelines issued by NRPD regarding:\r\n\t\u2022\tProcedures for responding to ICE requests for assistance, detainers, or arrests.\r\n\t\u2022\tLimitations, if any, on sharing information about individuals with federal immigration authorities.\r\n\t\u2022\tTraining materials for officers on handling ICE-related matters, including compliance with New York State\u2019s sanctuary laws.\r\n\t\u2022\tProtocols for handling situations where ICE agents seek access to individuals in police custody.\r\n\r\n3. Agreements, MOUs, and Funding Arrangements with ICE\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), contracts, or agreements between NRPD and ICE, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tAny formal partnership agreements between NRPD and ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tParticipation in ICE\u2019s 287(g) program or any other federal immigration task forces.\r\n\t\u2022\tFederal grants, funding, or financial incentives received by NRPD related to immigration enforcement efforts.\r\n\r\n4. Records of ICE-Related Enforcement Actions in New Rochelle\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any incident reports, arrest logs, call logs, or visitor logs documenting:\r\n\t\u2022\tICE agents visiting NRPD facilities or requesting assistance from officers.\r\n\t\u2022\tNRPD officers participating in immigration enforcement operations with ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny individuals arrested, detained, or transferred to ICE custody as a result of NRPD cooperation.\r\n\t\u2022\tComplaints, investigations, or internal reviews regarding potential civil rights violations linked to ICE-related operations.\r\n\r\n5. Metadata for Electronic Communications\r\n\t\u2022\tFor all emails or electronic messages responsive to this request, I request metadata including:\r\n\t\u2022\tSender and recipient information.\r\n\t\u2022\tTimestamps of messages exchanged.\r\n\t\u2022\tSubject lines and attachment details.\r\n\r\nLegal Justification for Disclosure\r\n\r\nThis FOIL request aligns with Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2), which grants the public a presumptive right to access government records. Courts have ruled that law enforcement agencies must disclose non-exempt information to ensure government accountability (Buffalo Broadcasting Co. v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Correctional Services, 155 A.D.2d 106 (3d Dep\u2019t 1990)).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, under New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the public\u2019s right to scrutinize government operations. Given the ongoing national debate over local police cooperation with ICE, the public has a compelling interest in understanding NRPD\u2019s role in immigration enforcement.\r\n\r\nNew York State has implemented sanctuary policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE, and this request seeks to determine whether NRPD policies comply with these state-level protections (Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980)).\r\n\r\nObligation to Preserve and Provide Records\r\n\r\nUnder Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993), government entities must preserve records subject to public disclosure laws. Accordingly, I request that no responsive records be deleted, altered, or destroyed while this FOIL request is under consideration.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all applicable fees for processing this request. Disclosure of these records serves the public interest by promoting government transparency and accountability and is not for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nUnder Matter of New York Times Co. v. City of New York Fire Dep\u2019t, 4 N.Y.3d 477 (2005), fee waivers should be granted when disclosure benefits the general public.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $100 in processing fees. Please notify me in advance if costs will exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nDue to heightened public concern over immigration enforcement and civil rights issues, I request expedited processing of this FOIL request. Under Matter of Westchester Rockland Newspapers v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980), timely disclosure of records affecting public safety and civil liberties is essential for government oversight.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a), I expect an acknowledgment of receipt within five (5) business days and an estimated timeline for disclosure.\r\n\r\nPlease provide electronic copies of records whenever possible. If any records are withheld or redacted, I request a written explanation citing specific legal exemptions in accordance with Gould v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 89 N.Y.2d 267 (1996).\r\n\r\nContact Information\r\n\r\nShould you require any clarification or additional details, please contact me at Jordan@Lassiter.eu.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report",

The denial was issued under Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g), which pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency materials. However, this exemption was misapplied, as my request explicitly seeks finalized documents, factual data, and external communications that do not qualify for exemption under FOIL.\r\n\r\nFOIL\u2019s Legislative Intent & Improper Invocation of \u00a7 87(2)(g)\r\n\r\nNew York\u2019s FOIL operates under a presumption of access, meaning that all government records are presumed public unless a specific exemption applies. Courts have narrowly construed exemptions to prevent unjustified secrecy. See Westchester Rockland Newspapers, Inc. v. Kimball, 50 N.Y.2d 575 (1980) (\u201cFOIL is based on a presumption of access, and its exemptions must be narrowly interpreted\u201d).\r\n\r\nPublic Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g) does not apply here because:\r\n\t1.\tInter-agency or intra-agency communications exemption does not cover factual data, final policies, or external agency interactions.\r\n\t\u2022\tI requested communications between the New Rochelle Police Department and ICE, a federal agency, not internal deliberations. Once shared with an external entity, these records are no longer exempt under \u00a7 87(2)(g).\r\n\t\u2022\tCourts have ruled that communications exchanged between local police and external federal agencies are not protected under inter-agency exemptions. See Matter of City of Newark v. Law Dep\u2019t of the City of New York, 305 A.D.2d 28 (1st Dep\u2019t 2003) (holding that communications exchanged between NYPD and federal agencies must be disclosed).\r\n\t2.\tFinal policies, agreements, and MOUs must be disclosed.\r\n\t\u2022\tFOIL mandates disclosure of final determinations, agreements, or policies.\r\n\t\u2022\tMy request explicitly included MOUs and funding arrangements, which are final agency decisions and must be released under New York Civil Liberties Union v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 2017 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 1543 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty. 2017).\r\n\t\u2022\tAny agreements with ICE impact the rights of the public, and withholding them violates Buffalo Broadcasting Co. v. NYS Dep\u2019t of Correctional Servs., 155 A.D.2d 106 (3d Dep\u2019t 1990) (holding that public contracts and agreements must be disclosed).\r\n\t3.\tStatistical and factual data are not exempt under FOIL.\r\n\t\u2022\tMy request sought records of ICE-related enforcement actions, which contain statistical and factual data and must be released per Matter of Data Tree, LLC v. Romaine, 9 N.Y.3d 454 (2007) (holding that agencies must disclose factual information even if embedded in otherwise exempt records).\r\n\t\u2022\tAny metadata, timestamps, sender/recipient information, or subject lines of emails between ICE and New Rochelle PD constitute factual records, which are explicitly required to be disclosed under Matter of Gould v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 89 N.Y.2d 267 (1996).\r\n\t4.\tDirecting me to an online manual does not satisfy FOIL obligations.\r\n\t\u2022\tThe response referencing the Manual of Procedure does not satisfy FOIL\u2019s requirement to provide direct access to records.\r\n\t\u2022\tMatter of Thomas v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Educ., 103 A.D.3d 495 (1st Dep\u2019t 2013), explicitly rejected an agency\u2019s attempt to avoid providing records by merely directing requesters to a website.\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records & Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\n\r\nI formally demand that the New Rochelle Police Department and City of New Rochelle preserve all responsive records while this appeal is pending. Any destruction, alteration, or deletion of records responsive to this request may constitute a violation of state and federal law.\r\n\t\u2022\tSee Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (holding that agencies must preserve all records potentially subject to disclosure).\r\n\t\u2022\tUnder Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(8), any attempt to willfully withhold records in bad faith could lead to judicial intervention and legal penalties.\r\n\r\nRequest for Immediate Disclosure\r\n\r\nGiven the above legal arguments and established case law, I request that the denial be reversed immediately and that the records be provided in electronic format within the statutory timeframe.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the records is withheld, I request that you provide a written explanation detailing the legal grounds for withholding, citing specific case law, in compliance with Gould v. New York City Police Dep\u2019t, 89 N.Y.2d 267 (1996).\r\n\r\nRequired Response Format\r\n\r\nPlease respond directly via the MuckRock platform for proper tracking of this request and CC my personal email at Jordan@Lassiter.eu.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords of: \r\n- Officers with authorized access to ALPR systems\r\n- Any audits that include records for the reason of the search, misuse, and how many times the ALPR search was run. \r\n- The number of times other agencies, including federal agencies, with access to the department's ALPR data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott",

The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is the first release of the Department\u2019s rolling production. At this time, the Department is in the process of reviewing additional email communications responsive to your request. We estimate that the next batch will be available in December 2024.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnder Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \"public records\" includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public's business, and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities. Therefore, records that are not conduct of the Department's business are being withheld or provided with redactions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code 7922.000, the Department asserts an exemption over email communications that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts. Section 7922.000 permits the non-disclosure of such records and information when \u201cthe public interest served by not disclosing the record and/or information, clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.\u201d Therefore, responsive emails that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts are withheld.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regard to Section 7922.000, the Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of records that consist of or contain detailed tactical, operational, deployment information, and analysis of potential threats. Disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to enable would-be perpetrators to discern areas of vulnerability and the intelligence assessments, evade security procedures, thereby endangering the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public in the event of similar law enforcement initiatives. Therefore, these records are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLastly, please be advised that Government Code Section 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest.\u00a0Therefore, responsive records containing\u00a0personal information are being provided to you with redactions.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Batch 1.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requester,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that this is the final release of the Department\u2019s rolling production.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnder Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \"public records\" includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public's business, and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities. Therefore, records that are not conduct of the Department's business are being withheld or provided with redactions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPursuant to Government Code 7922.000, the Department asserts an exemption over email communications that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts. Section 7922.000 permits the non-disclosure of such records and information when \u201cthe public interest served by not disclosing the record and/or information, clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.\u201d Therefore, responsive emails that consist of or contain deliberative discussion and drafts are withheld.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith regard to Section 7922.000, the Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of records that consist of or contain detailed tactical, operational, deployment information, and analysis of potential threats. Disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to enable would-be perpetrators to discern areas of vulnerability and the intelligence assessments, evade security procedures, thereby endangering the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public in the event of similar law enforcement initiatives. Therefore, these records are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLastly, please be advised that Government Code Section 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest.\u00a0Therefore, responsive records containing\u00a0personal information are being withheld or are being provided to you with redactions.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

I am a member of the media, primarily engaged in the dissemination of information.\r\n2. There is an urgency to inform the public about the circumstances of Mr. Dumitrascu's death.\r\n3. At least 7 people detained in the same area as Mr. Dumitrascu declared under oath that his care was delayed by CoreCivic staff.\r\n4. Multiple individuals detained with Mr. Dumitrascu on the night of his death declared under oath that CoreCivic shut off telephone lines in the hours following his death -- preventing them from communicating what happened.\r\n5. At least one person detained with Mr. Dumitrascu on the night of his death alleged CoreCivic and ICE accelerated the process of his removal in retaliation for attempting to share information about the death.\r\n6. CoreCivic facilities have previously been fined for negligence and contract violations that preceded deaths in ICE custody. See, e.g., https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24529304-stewart-contract-discrepancy-dec-2018.\r\n7. At least 55 deaths have occurred at CoreCivic's ICE facilities since 2003--more than any other ICE contractor.\r\n8. Since early 2017, ICE ceased affirmatively publishing detainee death reviews, forcing families to file FOIAs and sue when their loved ones die in order to obtain basic information on the government's findings.\r\n9. Congress recently approved the expansion of ICE detention by more than 20% -- up 7,500 beds to 41,500 funded.\r\n10. DHS and the present administration proposed cuts to inspection budgets for ICE detention centers, rendering the public less able to assess the lethality of ICE detention operations, including those at Otay Mesa.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Your request was received in this office on 4/3/2024. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \n\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182.

You had appealed an adverse determination of your request dated 4/3/2024.  You have requested copy of the ICE Health Services Corps Mortality Review for Cristian Dumitrascu, who died at the CoreCivic Otay Mesa Detention Center on March 5, 2023. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nWe have considered your request under the both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  After review of the documents, I have determined that portions of documents will be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6 of the Privacy Act and Exemptions 7 of the FOIA as described below. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may consist of social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are considered personal.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nExemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I determined that disclosure of law enforcement systems checks could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. \n\nSincerely, \n\nAngela Flores \n\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist\n",

In accordance with\r\nthe Department's appeal guidelines, I mailed a hard copy of this letter to\r\nthe Commissioner of Labor (Harriman State Office Campus Building 12, Room\r\n500 Albany, NY 12226). I hope it is not presumptuous of me to also email it\r\nto you directly. I appreciated your intervention to expedite the\r\nDepartment's response to a previous request and believe this request merits\r\nsimilar treatment.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration,\r\n\r\n*Peter Fugiel, PhD* | Postdoctoral Research Fellow\r\n\r\nDepartment of Labor Studies and Employment Relations\r\n\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations",

Responsive documents include, but are not limited to, drafts and revisions of the proposed rule, testimony and recordings from public hearings, analyses, summaries, reports, memoranda, letters, emails and attachments prepared, issued, or received by the Commissioner, members of the Wage Board, or Department of Labor staff during the period 7/1/2017\u20136/30/2019. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made for non-commercial research purposes. The requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer to receive the responsive records in an electronic format through the online portal or by email attachment. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Additionally, access is denied to information which, if disclosed , would jeopardize the capacity of an agency or an entity that has shared information with an agency to guarantee the security of its information technology assets, such assets encompassing both electronic information systems and infrastructures pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 (2) (i).

My hope is that if there are any labor charges associated with the responsive documents, we can discuss them within this week extension, before sending out a deposit request, and allow you the opportunity to amend further if you would like.\r\n\r\nIf you could kindly respond to this email in agreeance to the one-week extension (making the new due date 9/20/24), I would greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nKelsey Curtis\r\nDepartment Analyst\r\nOffice of the Director\r\nRecords Resource Section\r\nMichigan State Police\r\n7150 Harris Drive\r\nDimondale, Michigan 48821\r\nTX: 517-643-7738\r\n\r\n\"A PROUD tradition of SERVICE through EXCELLENCE, INTEGRITY, and COURTESY\"\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DB04EA.4A787BF0]<http://www.mi.gov/mspjobs>\n",

Unfortunately there it is not possible to give you an estimated completion date at this time, as the backlog remains significant.\r\n\r\nAll cases must go through two levels of review before a release determination is made.  As we have summarized in previous status checks, the NSA/CSS processes cases on a first-in, first-out basis, which is based on the original date of the request.  The NSA/CSS frequently receives referrals and consultations from other agencies that often pre-date the cases in our review queue.  Other agencies, with similar backlogs, may have a case for a year or more before determining that they need to consult or refer their case to the NSA.  When this happens, Department of Justice mandate requires this Agency to place a referral/consultation ahead of others.  Therefore our backlog queue has a tendency to fluctuate over time with regard to where each FOIA case stands.  This is also why it is difficult to provide an estimated response date as it could change.",

As stated in a previous email, dated 6 Sep. 2013, each case must go through two levels of review before a release determination can be made. As of now, the responsive material in your case is with a first level reviewer.  Once that is complete, the case will move to the 2nd level review queue.  It's difficult to estimate the completion date, but a tentative rough estimate is 8-12 months before a final release decision will be made. \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your patience.\r\nRegards,\r\nCindy B.\r\nNSA FOIA Office\r\n(301)688-6527",

As stated in a previous email, dated September 2014, each case must go through two levels of review before a release determination can be made. As of now, the responsive material in your case is with a second level reviewer.  It's difficult to estimate the completion date, but a tentative rough estimate is 2  years before a final release decision will be made. \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your patience.\nRegards,\r\nCindy B.\r\nNSA FOIA Office\r\n(301)688-6527",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Friday, November 5, 2021. In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the 11-year timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take several years to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before January 7, 2022, providing monthly installments thereafter. The district is currently processing multiple requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests. At this time of the year especially, with the upcoming holidays and the closure of district facilities for the Thanksgiving and winter breaks, staff resources are even more limited.\r\n\r\nAs students are the nature of our business, many public records frequently include information about students. If any of the responsive documents contain student names or other identifying information (parent names, student ID numbers etc.), it is the typical practice of the district to redact those names when the requestor agrees to that practice. Please let us know if you have an objection to such redaction and the basis of your objection.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D7D649.21D9FD90]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

These redactions primarily include student names or other student/parent identifying information, or the redaction of staff personal information such as a personal email address or cell phone number.

In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and you requested production of electronic records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have a third installment of records available for you. As requested, the records are being provided in reverse chronological order and represent an additional two of the public records requests received in 2021, and ten of the public records requests received in 2020, as well as the district responses to those requests. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. These redactions primarily include student names or other student/parent identifying information, or the redaction of staff personal information such as a personal email address or cell phone number.\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments or a non-password protected public link; however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email, and one request contains an OML video file that requires a special software to play, which we are also providing to you in order to view it. For security purposes, we are unable to upload those files to create a shareable link. Therefore, this installment of records has been placed onto a USB drive and is being mailed to you today via USPS Priority Mail. As noted in your request, the USB is addressed to:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144-2516\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 9405 5036 9930 0196 9827 76<https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction?qtc_tLabels1=9405%205036%209930%200196%209827%2076> and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, we anticipate the next installment of records responsive to your request will be available on or before April 22, 2022.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D83ACB.05C41BE0]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

Please note that this request was made by a parent of a student in the District, and our initial response provided notification that our typical process is to redact all student names and other identifying information, including parent names. No objection to such redactions was made in response to that notification; therefore, the initial requester\u2019s last name and other identifying information has been redacted to protect the identity of the student, whose name, and other identifying details have also been redacted.

These records represent 1 public records request received in 2021 and 5 public records requests received in 2020, and the district responses to those requests. Please note that two of these requests were made by parents of students in the district, and our initial response provided notification that our typical process is to redact all student names and other identifying information, including parent names. No objection to such redactions was made in response to that notification; therefore, the initial requester\u2019s name and other identifying information have been redacted and replaced with initials to protect the identity of the student, whose name, and other identifying details have also been redacted. In addition, a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. In addition, one record was withheld in its entirety as the record is a student education record and is protected from public disclosure (request 20200930 1b LB). The original requester was the parent of the student whose education record was requested, and the requester later abandoned her request, so there are no records to provide for that request. An Exemption Log for the record withheld is also provided in this installment.\r\n\r\nThese records are being provided electronically via a shared file which you can access using the link below.

These records installments were received on the following dates:\r\n\r\n01/07/2022\r\n02/11/2022\r\n03/21/2022\r\n04/22/2022\r\n05/27/2022\r\n07/28/2022\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the PRA.

In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. You also stated that any \u201crecords previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be found in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than one year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before November 21, 2023, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be December 31, 2024. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Monday, October 9, 2023. In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. You also stated that any \u201crecords previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the following reasons, your request is deemed abandoned as of February 16, 2024, and is now closed.\r\n\r\nIt is our standard practice to follow the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code (WAC), as these model rules serve to guide public agencies regarding public records requests. Under the model rules established in WAC 44-14-04005(1), it is the \u201cObligation of requestor to claim or review records. After the agency notifies the requestor that the records or an installment of them is ready for inspection or copying, the requestor must claim or review the records or the installment. RCW 42.56.120.\u201d Additionally, \u201cIf a requestor fails to claim or review the records or any installment of them within the thirty-day notification period, the agency may close the request and refile the records.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn our initial response on October 16, 2024, the district notified you that, \u201cAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 2023, an initial installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were notified that you must 1) click the link; and 2) download or click on the files; and 3) notify us to indicate receipt of the records or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available. On December 6, 2023, you responded to our notification with the word \u201cDONE\u201d next to both item number one and item number two, and with the word \u201cNOTIFIED\u201d next to item three. Accordingly, on December 6, 2023, the district acknowledged that you claimed the installment made available to you on November 17, 2023, and provided the next installment date to produce records as January 5, 2024.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2024, a second installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installment. On January 8, 2024, you notified the district that you were unable to access the installment as the link had expired. The same day, we responded and apologized for the inconvenience and reset the expiration date on the link to the records. You were notified that, \u201cIf you fail to respond to this notification by February 8, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d To date we have not received a response from you to claim these records or to indicate that you were unable to access these records. However, as you had attempted to claim the records from the initial link provided for this installment, the district moved forward with your request, despite not receiving confirmation that you were able to claim the records using the updated link.\r\n\r\nOn February 16, 2024, a third installment of records was provided via public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installments. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were also notified that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link, such as the ones provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, within 30 days you must click the link provided; and download or click on the files; and notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available to you. We also stated that, \u201cif you fail to respond to this notification by March 17, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d We also notified you that, \u201cwe have halted further work on this request until we receive confirmation that you have claimed receipt of both of the January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, installments.\u201d To date, no response to claim these records has been received.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, because the district has received no response from you acknowledging receipt of the installments of records provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, and because you have not contacted us in any other manner to indicate you were unable to access the records provided, your request has been deemed abandoned as of February 16, 2024, and is now closed.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]<https://www.everettsd.org/>\r\nWendy L.

Installments previously provided to you include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     *   01/07/2022\r\n     *   02/11/2022\r\n     *   03/21/2022\r\n     *   04/22/2022\r\n     *   05/27/2022\r\n     *   07/28/2022\r\n     *   11/17/2023\r\n     *   1/8/2024\r\n     *   2/16/2024\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease kindly respond to our request for clarification no later than Friday, March 29, 2024, so that we can move forward with processing your request. If we do not hear from you by that date, we will proceed with our understanding of the request as outlined above.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than a year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before May 10, 2024, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be May 2, 2025. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]<https://www.everettsd.org/>\r\nWendy L.

Based on the language used in that email it is unclear if this was intended to be a clarification of the March 19, 2024, request or if it was intended to be a new request for records.\r\n\r\nAt this time, we consider this to be a new request for records, as the date range extends beyond the date of the previous March 19, 2024, request, and the link you have included for us to upload records is different than the link provided for the March 19, 2024, request. If you intended for your email clarify your March 19, 2024, request, or if you intended for this new request to replace the March 19, 2024, request, please let us know. Otherwise, we will move forward with both requests respectively.\r\n\r\nIn this request, you have asked for, \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through March 22, 2024.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than a year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before May 17, 2024, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be May 30, 2025.

While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier for you to claim future installments of records and prevent further abandonments of your requests moving forward, whenever possible we will upload installments of records to you using the link you have provided for this request.\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Feverett-public-schools-district-29079%252Feverett-public-schools-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2010-2021-120970%252F%253Femail%253DPublicRecords%252540everettsd.org&url_auth_token=AAEh7OGhIjD3G3hthbXF_zOl4rI%3A1rne10%3AM10-zV4YF_dmLfUXiw4O8SOKj6lRHZzP8a9MqfnKtIo\r\n\r\nIf an alternate method to provide records is necessary, we will notify you that the records will be provided in another method, likely to be placed on a USB and mailed to the address provided:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records.

In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have concluded processing this request and have the responsive records available for you. These records include 127 public records requests and the district\u2019s responses to those requests that are still in existence for the period requested. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Redactions are marked with a redaction code on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is also provided in accordance with RCW 42.56.210(3).\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments or a non-password protected public link; however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email, and at least one request contains a file (OcularisViewer.exe) required to view an OML video file. For security purposes, we are unable to upload this file to create a shareable link. Therefore, the responsive records have been placed onto a USB drive which is being sent via USPS Priority Mail. As noted in your request, the records are addressed to:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 4200211545779405830109355084411851 and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records.\r\n\r\nI believe the records provided are fully responsive to your request as I have interpreted it, and, upon confirmation of the delivery of the records to you, your request will be considered fully satisfied and thereafter closed. If you have any questions or feel I have misinterpreted your request in any way, please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can work together to resolve any issues.\r\n\r\nFor reference, all of the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://www.everettsd.org/publicrecords.\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA86BB.0CDDA6B0]\r\n\r\nWendy L.

We appreciate your communication with us.\r\n\r\nOur records indicate that delivery of the USB containing the responsive records for your request was delivered and received by MuckRock at 12:17 pm on April 8, 2024. Attached is a copy of the delivery confirmation email received by USPS.\r\n\r\nIn our April 4, 2024, communication we stated that we would accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records, and that upon that confirmation your request would be considered fully satisfied and thereafter closed. Accordingly, as your request stated that providing records on USB by mail to MuckRock was an acceptable method for delivery, and because all responsive records have been provided and confirmation of delivery of the records was received, your request was considered fulfilled and was closed on April 8, 2024. As the district does not have anything further to provide for this closed request, no further action is planned and the one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review began on April 8, 2024.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to locate the records previously provided, or if you have any questions or feel I have misinterpreted your request in any way, please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can work together to resolve any issues.\r\n\r\nFor reference, all of the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page:  https://www.everettsd.org/publicrecords.\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DA97E3.3798C4A0]\r\n\r\nWendy L.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on March 22, 2024. In that request, you asked for, \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through March 22, 2024.\u201d\r\n\r\nToday I am writing to let you know that we have an eighth installment of records available for you. These records include 24 public records requests received by the district between September 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, and the district\u2019s responses to those requests. Please note that we acknowledge your request to receive records in reverse chronological order, however, there is one public records request during this timeframe (December 13, 2022) that will be provided in the next installment of records, as it is a large request requiring extensive redaction of student and parent personal information and it is still being processed. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Redactions are marked with a redaction code on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided in accordance with RCW 42.56.210(3).\r\n\r\nThe responsive records have been placed onto a USB drive which is being sent via USPS Priority Mail to the address provided in your request:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 4200211545779405530109355107600834<https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction!input.action?tLabels=4200211545779405530109355107600834> and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records. Anticipated delivery date is Saturday, March 1, 2025.\r\n\r\nThe district has confirmed delivery of the previous installment provided, which the district accepts as your receipt of the installment provided, which was delivered in or at the mailbox at 3:44 pm on Monday, January 27, 2025. A copy of the delivery confirmation for that installment is attached for reference. If you did not receive the records provided, please let us know.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, we anticipate providing the next installment of records on or before April 9, 2025.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DB886E.29686850]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWendy L.
