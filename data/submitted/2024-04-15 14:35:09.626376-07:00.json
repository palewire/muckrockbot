I received a response on 4/12.  \r\n- On 4/12/2024 I requested copies of final reports or abbreviated final reports of internal investigations into agency employees where the primary or secondary allegation of misconduct is categorized as \"Election and Political Mail \u2013 Theft, Rifling, Possession: Code (IM20)\". \r\n- on 4/13 I received another spreadsheet of mail fraud investigations.\r\n\r\nI understand now that Election and Political mail was not a tracked category until 2020, however my second request was for final reports rather than the tracking data about the investigation. \r\n\r\nCould you call me to discuss the data I received back because I don't think its responsive to the records I requested.  I am happy to limit the request to only include investigations from 2020 until Today explicitly categorized as Election or Political Mail or even further limit the request with a more limited date frame.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help with these requests.  I've also sent this email using my work account dhruv_mehrotra@wired.com.  Please refer to that email for my phone number\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",
