Any and all documentation, memoranda, reports, correspondence, rulings, opinions, orders, or other records issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) related to requests for surveillance warrants or authorizations under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), specifically those involving the inclusion of individuals on watch lists maintained by government agencies.\r\n\r\n2. Any records or communications between the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and government agencies, including but not limited to the National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Department of Justice (DOJ), and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), regarding the authorization, oversight, or review of surveillance activities, particularly in cases where such activities may have been conducted without proper authorization or in violation of civil liberties.\r\n\r\n3. Any records or communications discussing or referencing instances of potential abuse or misuse of surveillance authorities granted under Section 702 of FISA, including but not limited to the inclusion of individuals on watch lists without adequate evidence or justification, or the targeting of individuals for electronic surveillance or harassment without proper legal authorization from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).\r\n\r\n4. Any policies, procedures, guidelines, or directives issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) governing the issuance of surveillance warrants or authorizations under Section 702 of FISA, including any documentation outlining the criteria for determining the necessity and proportionality of surveillance activities targeting U.S. persons.\r\n\r\n5. Any records or communications indicating compliance or non-compliance by government agencies with the orders, rulings, or guidelines issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) regarding surveillance activities, including any instances where agencies may have failed to obtain proper authorization or exceeded the scope of authorized surveillance.\r\n\r\nI specifically request records covering the period from January 1, 2006, to April 6, 2024, inclusive.\r\n\r\nAs provided for under the FOIA, I am requesting that any fees associated with the processing of this request be waived on the grounds that the release of this information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to transparency and accountability in government surveillance activities.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records in electronic format, if available, or in hard copy if electronic format is not feasible. If certain portions of the requested records are exempt from disclosure under applicable FOIA exemptions, I request that the non-exempt portions be released with an explanation of the basis for any redactions or withholdings.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEvan L Rees",
