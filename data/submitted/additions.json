See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddr_NOVIELLOJohnny.pdf. \r\n\r\nThis request includes, but is not limited to, the following records: \r\n\r\n1. Any Mortality Review  and associated working papers conducted by ICE Health Services Corps or the Bureau of Prisons\r\n2. Any Death Review conducted by ICE ERAU or BOP\r\n3. Any Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis or similar document created by Creative Corrections or another Contractor\r\n4. All extant video showing Mr. Noviello in ICE or BOP custody.\r\n5. All BOP and/or ICE medical records for Mr. Noviello. \r\n6. Any Executive Summary or Findings information regarding Mr. Noviello's death\r\n7. Any autopsy report for Mr. Noviello, complete with toxicology. \r\n8. Records of any contract discrepancy reports or similar findings.\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e) and declare under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the news media investigating and reporting edited pieces on deaths in ICE custody and abuses of power by federal law enforcement agencies. See, e.g., https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/. \r\n2. Mr. Noviello is the first ICE detainee to die in a BOP facility in over a decade. \r\n3. His death in BOP's FDC Miami following his imprisonment at Krome Service Processing Center has been the subject of widespread media coverage about which serious questions exist as to the care the government provided him. \r\n4. ICE's Miami Field Office has overseen the custody and care of at least six (6) people, including Mr. Noviello, who died in ICE custody in FY25--the most of any field office in the United States.\r\n5. An urgent need exists for the public to obtain, review, and understand the circumstances surrounding Mr. Noviello's death in custody as ICE deaths continue to rise to their highest levels since the Covid pandemic and the agency is poised to massively expand ICE detention capacity.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",
