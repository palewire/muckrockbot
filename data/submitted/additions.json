I am able to receive these files via USB, CD, DVD, or other digital formats, if available. I am requesting, specifically, audio from the dates of December 5th, 6th, and 7th. in the year 2022. As law requires, the retention of E911 audio should be available for no less than one year, this request will hopefully be fairly easy to fulfill.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHTP",
