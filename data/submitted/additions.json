Any communication sent to or from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Visa Services which contain any of the following non-case sensitive search terms, where the use of an asterisk (*) represents a wildcard (e.g., a search for \"*wiki*\" would return an email with the word \"https://www.wikipedia.org\"):\r\n*canary*\r\n\"Canary Mission\"\r\n\"Betar\"\r\nhttps://x.com/Betar_USA/*\r\nhttps://www.x.com/Betar_USA/*\r\n\r\n2.
