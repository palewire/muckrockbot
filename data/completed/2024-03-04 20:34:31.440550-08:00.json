Requests for Records\r\nRecords Request No. 1: All Documents constituting, reflecting, relating to or that contain current use policies if any for each type of 1033-program controlled equipment, including situations or circumstances in which use is authorized or prohibited.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 2: Records that list the dates, locations, suspected offense(s) or rationale for operation, controlled equipment deployed, arrests, and uses of force for each deployment of 1033-program controlled equipment since July 1st, 2019, specifically: firearms, armored vehicles, and night vision equipment.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 3: All records of complaints regarding the use and impact of 1033-program controlled equipment, including correspondence, visual or audio-visual materials, and responses to complaints.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 4: Documents that constitute, reflect, relate to or that contain rationales or criteria for acquisition of 1033-program controlled equipment, prior to its acquisition.\r\n\r\nII. Response Time\r\nPlease provide requested documents as they become available.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten (10) days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6255. Pursuant to section 6253, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n\r\nThe American Friends Service Committee seeks this information as the requestor to promote and provide public access to these documents and increase civic engagement. Because this request is made on behalf of a nonprofit public interest organization, with the intent to make this material easily accessible to the public, we request that you waive any fees. In responding to this request, please keep in mind that Article 1, \u00a7 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution expressly requires you to broadly construe all provisions that further the public\u2019s right of access, and to apply any limitations on access as narrowly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the Healing Justice Program at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Good evening,\r\n\r\nThe PA Department of Human Services (department) received your below Right-To-Know Law (RTKL) request.\r\n\r\nThe RTKL requires a requester to submit to the agency a request that identifies or describes the records requested with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to ascertain which records are being requested. Office of the Governor v. Engelkemier, 148 A.3d 522, 530 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016). A request must identify the subject matter, the scope, and the timeframe of the records sought.  You provided a time frame of the records you are seeking.  However, your request has no defined group of individuals whose records are to be searched nor does it identify any subject matter, but states that you are seeking \"[c]opies of all 'change requests' or reasonably similar correspondence\" which does not indicate some business of the agency and would likely lead to a broad universe of responsive records. Therefore, your request is insufficiently specific.\r\n\r\nIn order for the department to process your request, please identify a subject matter of the communications regarding \"change requests\" you are seeking.  The subject matter of the request must identify the 'transaction or activity' of the agency for which the record is sought.  Please also identify the specific people at the department (or a group, such as senior staff) that may have sent or received the communications you are seeking.\r\n\r\nYour prompt response will be appreciated so that the department can continue working on your request.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAndrea Bankes | Agency Open Records Officer\r\nOffice of Administration\r\nDepartment of Human Services\r\nRoom 234 Health & Welfare Building | Hbg PA 17120\r\nPhone: 717.787.3422 | Fax: 717.772.2490\r\nwww.dhs.pa.gov<http://www.dhs.pa.gov/>\r\n\r\nCreating partnerships to deliver quality services to customers through collaboration, consultation and supports.\n",

This record is a responsive record integral to my Request. Release of the Agency\u2019s copy is not optional.\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT. \r\n\r\nI am also seeking records in their native format (MS. Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, ADA accessible PDF files by return email with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records via email in PDF format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done. \r\n\r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. Emails should be provided as MS Outlook files, if not encrypted or otherwise unable to be opened by me. Only if this is not possible, emails should be produced with their embedded hyperlinked attachments by using the \u201cFile => Save as Adobe PDF\u201d command within Outlook or by other software that produces the same result.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nProvide Records via Muckrock.com.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. Notwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest. \r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES. \r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee. The OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat. 2477 .)\r\n\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\nI certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that a compelling need exists for expedited processing as discussed below: \r\n1.\tRecords are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. \r\na.\tPotential bias in NARA\u2019s handling of unauthorized removal of official records by our current and prior president and other senior officials in those administrations is of great public interest, which relates to my underlying FOIA request.\r\nb.\tI may place this correspondence into the public domain to document NARA alleged misconduct.\r\n\r\n2.\tAdditionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOAI meeting. I have an active email distribution list of Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA professionals, FOIA advocacy groups media and interested parties. I also communicate regularly with members of Congress.\r\n\u2022\tSee examples below.\r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the Chief FOIA Officers Council https://www.archives.gov/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council  \r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the FOIA Advisory Committee | National Archives https://www.archives.gov/ogis/foia-advisory-committee/public-comments \r\n\r\n-\tOGIS Annual Open Meeting Public comments  https://www.archives.gov/ogis/outreach-events/annual-open-meeting  \r\n\r\n-\tDocument Cloud.

See Office of Government Information Services Advisory Opinion No. 2020-01: Agencies Must Provide Estimated Dates of Completion Upon Request https://www.archives.gov/ogis/advisory-opinions/2020-01-agencies-must-provide-edcs \r\n\r\nSTILL-INTERESTED PREEMPTIVE REPLY.  This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n \r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office. There are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default. \r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. \r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later. \r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. \r\n\r\nIn any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues. \r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action  I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter.  No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted or fragmented data.  Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).  \r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals and of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n\r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n\r\nAPPLICABLE RETENTION SCHEDULE, NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n\r\n020 \tAccess and disclosure request files. Case files created in response to requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) process, Privacy Act (PA), Classification Challenge, and similar access programs, and completed by: \u2022 granting the request in full \u2022 granting the request in part \u2022 denying the request for any reason including: o inability to fulfill request because records do not exist o inability to fulfill request because request inadequately describes records o inability to fulfill request because search or reproduction fees are not paid \tTemporary. Destroy 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later, but longer retention is authorized if required for business use. \tDAA-GRS-2016-0002-0001 \r\n\r\nALTERATION/DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS\r\n\r\n18 U.S. CODE \u00a7 1519 - DESTRUCTION, ALTERATION, OR FALSIFICATION OF RECORDS.\r\n\r\nWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1519 - Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records.

See also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C).\r\n7.\tFOIA provides that any person who has not been provided the records requested pursuant to FOIA, after exhausting their administrative remedies, may seek legal redress from the Federal District Court to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant.\r\n8.\tRegarding the names of the FOIA requesters, the courts have held that under the FOIA requesters do not have an expectation of privacy. Stauss v. IRS, 516 F. Supp. 1218, 1223 (D.D.C. 1981),\r\n9.\tUnder FOIA, the federal agency has the burden of sustaining its actions. 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\r\n10.\tPursuant to FOIA, a Court may assess attorney fees and litigation costs against the United States if the Plaintiff prevails in an action thereunder.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E).\r\n11.\tDepartment of Justice (DOJ) has issued a handbook addressing FOIA Annual Reports. See DOJ, Handbook for Agency Annual Freedom of Information Act Reports, \u201cDisposition of FOIA Requests,\u201d (available at http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/pages/attachments/2014/11/04/department_of_justice_handbook_for_agency_annual_freedom_of_information_act_reports.pdf) (\u201cDOJ Handbook\u201d). \r\n12.\tAmong other things, the DOJ Handbook states, \u201cAll requests (perfected and non-perfected), appeals, and consultations that were pending at any time during the relevant fiscal year [October 1st through September 30th] will be captured.\u201d \r\n13.\tThe DOJ Handbook also states: \r\n\u201c[E]ach agency is ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of its Annual FOIA Report.  It is therefore essential for agencies to take steps that will ensure that they are adequately tracking all of the information necessary to complete the Annual FOIA Report sections detailed below. Agencies that utilize a tracking or case management system for this purpose are responsible for ensuring that the system they are using can produce an accurate Annual FOIA Report that is in compliance with the law and Department of Justice guidance.\u201d DOJ Handbook, at 3.\r\n\r\nI believe that I have adequately described the records that I am seeking.

I am also seeking a copy of this FOIA Request, which is an Agency record subject to FOIA that exists and is in the Agency\u2019s possession at the time of my FOIA request. This record is a responsive record integral to my Request. Release of the Agency\u2019s copy is not optional.\r\n \r\nREQUESTED FORMAT.\r\n \r\nI am also seeking records in their native format (MS. Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, ADA accessible PDF files by return email with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records via email in PDF format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done.\r\n \r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n \r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. Emails should be provided as MS Outlook files, if not encrypted or otherwise unable to be opened by me. Only if this is not possible, emails should be produced with their embedded hyperlinked attachments by using the \u201cFile => Save as Adobe PDF\u201d command within Outlook or by other software that produces the same result.\r\n \r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n \r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number and cite records sought.\r\n \r\nProvide Records via Muckrock.com.\r\n \r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. Notwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n \r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n \r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee. The OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat. 2477 .)\r\n \r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING.\r\nI certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that a compelling need exists for expedited processing as discussed below:\r\n1. Records are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\na. Potential bias in NARA\u2019s handling of unauthorized removal of official records by our current and prior president and other senior officials in those administrations is of great public interest, which relates to my underlying FOIA request.\r\nb. I may place this correspondence into the public domain to document NARA alleged misconduct.\r\n \r\n2. Additionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOAI meeting. I have an active email distribution list of Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA professionals, FOIA advocacy groups media and interested parties. I also communicate regularly with members of Congress.\r\n\u2022 See examples below.\r\n \r\n- Public Comments Submitted to the Chief FOIA Officers Council https://www.archives.gov/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council\r\n \r\n- Public Comments Submitted to the FOIA Advisory Committee | National Archives https://www.archives.gov/ogis/foia-advisory-committee/public-comments\r\n \r\n- OGIS Annual Open Meeting Public comments https://www.archives.gov/ogis/outreach-events/annual-open-meeting\r\n \r\n- Document Cloud. Org https://www.documentcloud.org/app?q=%2Buser%3Arobert-hammond-106693%20 (e.g., \u201cSample FOIA Template With Recent Developments to Combat Agency Misconduct.\u201d)\r\nNARA must evaluate all my public comments (which NARA has) along with my methods of dissemination and state that it has done so in any denial of expedited processing.\r\n\u2022 The subject of the requested records concerns government operations and activities.\r\n\u2022 Government misconduct is incontrovertible.\r\n\u2022 The disclosure is likely to contribute to understanding of these operations or activities.\r\n\u2022 Disclosure will likely result in public understanding of the subject.\r\n\u2022 The contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be significant.\r\n\u2022 The requester has no commercial interest.\r\n\u2022 The public interest in disclosure is great.\r\n\u2022 I use \u201ceditorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work.\u201d\r\n\u2022 My work is distributed by email to an audience of FOIA professionals, media, and interested parties with frequent active distribution.\r\n3. I am seeking expedited processing due to eminent substantial loss of due process rights related to mu underlying FOIA request and appeal, which is now ripe for litigation.\r\n \r\nESTIMATED COMPLETION DATES\r\n \r\nProvide me with the initial estimated completion date (ESD) for this matter along with contemporaneous adjusted ESDs as they change. See Office of Government Information Services Advisory Opinion No. 2020-01: Agencies Must Provide Estimated Dates of Completion Upon Request https://www.archives.gov/ogis/advisory-opinions/2020-01-agencies-must-provide-edcs\r\n \r\nSTILL-INTERESTED PREEMPTIVE REPLY. This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n \r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office. There are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n \r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1. Ensure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2. Absent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3. Use requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default.\r\n4. Memorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5. Provide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6. Advise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7. Prior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8. In the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n \r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\r\n \r\nPlease search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later.\r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved.\r\n \r\nIn any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues.\r\n \r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n \r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n \r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter. No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted or fragmented data. Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).\r\n \r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals and of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n \r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n \r\nAPPLICABLE RETENTION SCHEDULE, NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n \r\n020 Access and disclosure request files. Case files created in response to requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) process, Privacy Act (PA), Classification Challenge, and similar access programs, and completed by: \u2022 granting the request in full \u2022 granting the request in part \u2022 denying the request for any reason including: o inability to fulfill request because records do not exist o inability to fulfill request because request inadequately describes records o inability to fulfill request because search or reproduction fees are not paid Temporary. Destroy 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later, but longer retention is authorized if required for business use.

The definition of \u201crecords\u201d includes:\r\n\u201c[A]ill books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of data in them.\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied).\r\n2. FOIA requires that \u201ceach agency, upon any request for records which (i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A).\r\n3. FOIA requires that \u201ceach agency shall establish a system to assign an individualized tracking number for each request received that will take longer than ten days to process and provide to each person making a request the tracking number assigned to the request\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)(7)(A).\r\n4. FOIA requires that each agency shall \u201cestablish a telephone line or Internet service that provides information about the status of a request to the person making the request using the assigned tracking number, including the date on which the agency originally received the request; and an estimated date on which the agency will complete action on the request. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)(7)(B).\r\n5. FOIA also requires federal agencies to make a final determination on FOIA administrative appeals that it receives within twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of such appeal, unless the agency expressly provides notice to the requester of \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d meriting additional time for responding to a FOIA request. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(ii).\r\n6. FOIA expressly provides that a person shall be deemed to have constructively exhausted their administrative remedies if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limitations provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(I) - (ii). See also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C).\r\n7. FOIA provides that any person who has not been provided the records requested pursuant to FOIA, after exhausting their administrative remedies, may seek legal redress from the Federal District Court to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant.\r\n8. Regarding the names of the FOIA requesters, the courts have held that under the FOIA requesters do not have an expectation of privacy. Stauss v. IRS, 516 F. Supp. 1218, 1223 (D.D.C. 1981),\r\n9. Under FOIA, the federal agency has the burden of sustaining its actions. 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\r\n10. Pursuant to FOIA, a Court may assess attorney fees and litigation costs against the United States if the Plaintiff prevails in an action thereunder. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E).\r\n11. Department of Justice (DOJ) has issued a handbook addressing FOIA Annual Reports. See DOJ, Handbook for Agency Annual Freedom of Information Act Reports, \u201cDisposition of FOIA Requests,\u201d (available at http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/pages/attachments/2014/11/04/department_of_justice_handbook_for_agency_annual_freedom_of_information_act_reports.pdf) (\u201cDOJ Handbook\u201d).\r\n12. Among other things, the DOJ Handbook states, \u201cAll requests (perfected and non-perfected), appeals, and consultations that were pending at any time during the relevant fiscal year [October 1st through September 30th] will be captured.\u201d\r\n13. The DOJ Handbook also states:\r\n\u201c[E]ach agency is ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of its Annual FOIA Report. It is therefore essential for agencies to take steps that will ensure that they are adequately tracking all of the information necessary to complete the Annual FOIA Report sections detailed below. Agencies that utilize a tracking or case management system for this purpose are responsible for ensuring that the system they are using can produce an accurate Annual FOIA Report that is in compliance with the law and Department of Justice guidance.\u201d DOJ Handbook, at 3.\r\n \r\nI believe that I have adequately described the records that I am seeking. If you believe that my request is unclear, if you have any questions, or if there is anything else that you need from me to complete this request in a timely manner, please contact me in writing, so that I may perfect my request. If you deem that any portion of my request is unclear, answer the remaining portions and I will perfect a request for additional material as needed.\r\n \r\nThank you very much in advance.\r\n \r\nWith my respect,\r\n \r\n/s/\r\nRobert Hammond\r\nRequester\r\nWhistleblower\r\n \r\nReferences:\r\n(a) The Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., as amended,\r\n(b) Joint publication of U.S. Department of Justice, Executive Office of the President and U.S. General Services Administration of July 2011, \u201cYour Right to Federal Records\u201d\r\n(c) The Privacy Act (\u201cPA\u201d) of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, et seq., as amended\r\n(d) DoD 5400.11-R, May 14, 2007, Department of Defense Privacy Program\r\n(e) DoD 5400.7-R, September 1998, DoD Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program\r\n(f) DoD 6025.18-R, Jan. 24, 2003, DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation\r\n(g) GAO Report GAO-12-828 of July 2012, subject Freedom of Information Act\r\n(h) Department of Justice Handbook for Agency Annual Freedom of Information Act Reports\r\n(i) (b) Administrative Instruction 106, \u201cAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program,\u201d January 30, 2014\r\n(j) DoD Directive 5145.01, \u201cGeneral Counsel of the Department of Defense (GC DoD),\u201d December 2, 2013, as amended\r\n(k) DoD Directive 5145.04, \u201cDefense Legal Services Agency (DLSA),\u201d April 16, 2012\r\n(l) (f) DoD Directive 5400.11, \u201cDoD Privacy Program,\u201d October 29, 2014\r\n(m) DoD Manual 8910.01, Volume 1, \u201cDoD Information Collections Manual: Procedures for DoD Internal Information Collections,\u201d June 30, 2014\r\n(n) Executive Order 12988, \u201cCivil Justice Reform,\u201d February 5, 1996\r\n(o) Public Law 101-552, \u201cAdministrative Dispute Resolution Act,\u201d November 15, 1990\r\n(p) Public Law 104\u2013320, \u201cAdministrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996,\u201d October 19, 1996\r\n(q) Presidential Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, \u201cDesignation of Interagency Committees to Facilitate and Encourage Agency Use of Alternate Means of Dispute Resolution and Negotiated Rulemaking,\u201d May 1, 1998\r\n(r) United States Code, Title 5\r\n(s) DoD Instruction 5145.05, \u201cAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and Conflict Management\u201d\r\n(t) Alternate Dispute Resolution Handbook (opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/employee-relations/employee-rights-appeals/alternative-dispute-resolution/handbook.pdf)\r\n(u) President Obama's FOIA Memorandum and Attorney General Holder's FOIA Guidelines (justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/legacy/2014/07/23/foia-memorandum.pdf)\r\n \r\n\u2003\r\n# Hammond Public Comments.

I am also seeking a copy of this FOIA Request, which is an Agency record subject to FOIA that exists and is in the Agency\u2019s possession at the time of my FOIA request. This record is a responsive record integral to my Request. Release of the Agency\u2019s copy is not optional.\r\n \r\nREQUESTED FORMAT.\r\n \r\nI am also seeking records in their native format (MS. Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, ADA accessible PDF files by return email with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records via email in PDF format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done.\r\n \r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n \r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. Emails should be provided as MS Outlook files, if not encrypted or otherwise unable to be opened by me. Only if this is not possible, emails should be produced with their embedded hyperlinked attachments by using the \u201cFile => Save as Adobe PDF\u201d command within Outlook or by other software that produces the same result.\r\n \r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n \r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number and cite records sought.\r\n \r\nProvide Records via Muckrock.com.\r\n \r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. Notwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n \r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n \r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee. The OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat. 2477 .)\r\n \r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING.\r\nI certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that a compelling need exists for expedited processing as discussed below:\r\n1. Records are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\na. Potential bias in NARA\u2019s handling of unauthorized removal of official records by our current and prior president and other senior officials in those administrations is of great public interest, which relates to my underlying FOIA request.\r\nb. I may place this correspondence into the public domain to document NARA alleged misconduct.\r\n \r\n2. Additionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOAI meeting. I have an active email distribution list of Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA professionals, FOIA advocacy groups media and interested parties. I also communicate regularly with members of Congress.\r\n\u2022 See examples below.\r\n \r\n- Public Comments Submitted to the Chief FOIA Officers Council https://www.archives.gov/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council\r\n \r\n- Public Comments Submitted to the FOIA Advisory Committee | National Archives https://www.archives.gov/ogis/foia-advisory-committee/public-comments\r\n \r\n- OGIS Annual Open Meeting Public comments https://www.archives.gov/ogis/outreach-events/annual-open-meeting\r\n \r\n- Document Cloud.

I am seeking expedited processing due to eminent substantial loss of due process rights related to mu underlying FOIA request and appeal, which is now ripe for litigation.\r\n \r\nESTIMATED COMPLETION DATES\r\n \r\nProvide me with the initial estimated completion date (ESD) for this matter along with contemporaneous adjusted ESDs as they change. See Office of Government Information Services Advisory Opinion No. 2020-01: Agencies Must Provide Estimated Dates of Completion Upon Request https://www.archives.gov/ogis/advisory-opinions/2020-01-agencies-must-provide-edcs\r\n \r\nSTILL-INTERESTED PREEMPTIVE REPLY. This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n \r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office. There are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n \r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1. Ensure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2. Absent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3. Use requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default.\r\n4. Memorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5. Provide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6. Advise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7. Prior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8. In the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n \r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\r\n \r\nPlease search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later.\r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved.\r\n \r\nIn any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues.\r\n \r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n \r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n \r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter. No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted or fragmented data. Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).\r\n \r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals and of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n \r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n \r\nAPPLICABLE RETENTION SCHEDULE, NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n \r\n020 Access and disclosure request files. Case files created in response to requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) process, Privacy Act (PA), Classification Challenge, and similar access programs, and completed by: \u2022 granting the request in full \u2022 granting the request in part \u2022 denying the request for any reason including: o inability to fulfill request because records do not exist o inability to fulfill request because request inadequately describes records o inability to fulfill request because search or reproduction fees are not paid Temporary. Destroy 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later, but longer retention is authorized if required for business use.

The definition of \u201crecords\u201d includes:\r\n\u201c[A]ill books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of data in them.\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied).\r\n2. FOIA requires that \u201ceach agency, upon any request for records which (i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A).\r\n3. FOIA requires that \u201ceach agency shall establish a system to assign an individualized tracking number for each request received that will take longer than ten days to process and provide to each person making a request the tracking number assigned to the request\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)(7)(A).\r\n4. FOIA requires that each agency shall \u201cestablish a telephone line or Internet service that provides information about the status of a request to the person making the request using the assigned tracking number, including the date on which the agency originally received the request; and an estimated date on which the agency will complete action on the request. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)(7)(B).\r\n5. FOIA also requires federal agencies to make a final determination on FOIA administrative appeals that it receives within twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of such appeal, unless the agency expressly provides notice to the requester of \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d meriting additional time for responding to a FOIA request. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(ii).\r\n6. FOIA expressly provides that a person shall be deemed to have constructively exhausted their administrative remedies if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limitations provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(I) - (ii). See also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C).\r\n7. FOIA provides that any person who has not been provided the records requested pursuant to FOIA, after exhausting their administrative remedies, may seek legal redress from the Federal District Court to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant.\r\n8. Regarding the names of the FOIA requesters, the courts have held that under the FOIA requesters do not have an expectation of privacy. Stauss v. IRS, 516 F. Supp. 1218, 1223 (D.D.C. 1981),\r\n9. Under FOIA, the federal agency has the burden of sustaining its actions. 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\r\n10. Pursuant to FOIA, a Court may assess attorney fees and litigation costs against the United States if the Plaintiff prevails in an action thereunder. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E).\r\n11. Department of Justice (DOJ) has issued a handbook addressing FOIA Annual Reports. See DOJ, Handbook for Agency Annual Freedom of Information Act Reports, \u201cDisposition of FOIA Requests,\u201d (available at http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/pages/attachments/2014/11/04/department_of_justice_handbook_for_agency_annual_freedom_of_information_act_reports.pdf) (\u201cDOJ Handbook\u201d).\r\n12. Among other things, the DOJ Handbook states, \u201cAll requests (perfected and non-perfected), appeals, and consultations that were pending at any time during the relevant fiscal year [October 1st through September 30th] will be captured.\u201d\r\n13. The DOJ Handbook also states:\r\n\u201c[E]ach agency is ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of its Annual FOIA Report. It is therefore essential for agencies to take steps that will ensure that they are adequately tracking all of the information necessary to complete the Annual FOIA Report sections detailed below. Agencies that utilize a tracking or case management system for this purpose are responsible for ensuring that the system they are using can produce an accurate Annual FOIA Report that is in compliance with the law and Department of Justice guidance.\u201d DOJ Handbook, at 3.\r\n \r\nI believe that I have adequately described the records that I am seeking. If you believe that my request is unclear, if you have any questions, or if there is anything else that you need from me to complete this request in a timely manner, please contact me in writing, so that I may perfect my request. If you deem that any portion of my request is unclear, answer the remaining portions and I will perfect a request for additional material as needed.\r\n \r\nThank you very much in advance.\r\n \r\nWith my respect,\r\n \r\n/s/\r\nRobert Hammond\r\nRequester\r\nWhistleblower\r\n \r\nReferences:\r\n(a) The Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., as amended,\r\n(b) Joint publication of U.S. Department of Justice, Executive Office of the President and U.S. General Services Administration of July 2011, \u201cYour Right to Federal Records\u201d\r\n(c) The Privacy Act (\u201cPA\u201d) of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, et seq., as amended\r\n(d) DoD 5400.11-R, May 14, 2007, Department of Defense Privacy Program\r\n(e) DoD 5400.7-R, September 1998, DoD Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program\r\n(f) DoD 6025.18-R, Jan. 24, 2003, DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation\r\n(g) GAO Report GAO-12-828 of July 2012, subject Freedom of Information Act\r\n(h) Department of Justice Handbook for Agency Annual Freedom of Information Act Reports\r\n(i) (b) Administrative Instruction 106, \u201cAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program,\u201d January 30, 2014\r\n(j) DoD Directive 5145.01, \u201cGeneral Counsel of the Department of Defense (GC DoD),\u201d December 2, 2013, as amended\r\n(k) DoD Directive 5145.04, \u201cDefense Legal Services Agency (DLSA),\u201d April 16, 2012\r\n(l) (f) DoD Directive 5400.11, \u201cDoD Privacy Program,\u201d October 29, 2014\r\n(m) DoD Manual 8910.01, Volume 1, \u201cDoD Information Collections Manual: Procedures for DoD Internal Information Collections,\u201d June 30, 2014\r\n(n) Executive Order 12988, \u201cCivil Justice Reform,\u201d February 5, 1996\r\n(o) Public Law 101-552, \u201cAdministrative Dispute Resolution Act,\u201d November 15, 1990\r\n(p) Public Law 104\u2013320, \u201cAdministrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996,\u201d October 19, 1996\r\n(q) Presidential Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, \u201cDesignation of Interagency Committees to Facilitate and Encourage Agency Use of Alternate Means of Dispute Resolution and Negotiated Rulemaking,\u201d May 1, 1998\r\n(r) United States Code, Title 5\r\n(s) DoD Instruction 5145.05, \u201cAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and Conflict Management\u201d\r\n(t) Alternate Dispute Resolution Handbook (opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/employee-relations/employee-rights-appeals/alternative-dispute-resolution/handbook.pdf)\r\n(u) President Obama's FOIA Memorandum and Attorney General Holder's FOIA Guidelines (justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/legacy/2014/07/23/foia-memorandum.pdf)\r\n \r\n\u2003\r\n# Hammond Public Comments.

This includes \u201cMy new idea is to transfer the currently poorly-executed OGIS and DOJ OIP FOIA compliance and audit functions to GAO \u2013 which is a great fit for GAO \u2013 while OGIS and DOJ OIP retain their current funding.\u201d \r\n\r\nKirstin, Bobby, Alina, \r\n\r\nWhen I type in the chat to read a question or comment, I expect you to read it and not inaccurately paraphrase it and then dodge the question. \r\nThat was not wise.\r\n\r\nFor example, I typed into the chat: \u201cOGIS certified meeting minutes impermissibly excludes/redacts meeting participants, while Chief FOIA Officers Council participants are not.\u201d Kirsten did not read the question but preemptively stated:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is Kirsten Mitchell, the designated federal officer. There was another comment regarding minutes of these meetings. And when I say \"these meetings,\" the FOIA Advisory Committee and the Chief FOIA Officer Council. Those are two separate bodies. I just want to put on the record that FOIA Advisory Committee minutes are governed by the federal advisory committee act. Chief FOIA officer council minutes are governed by the information act.

Bobby, if you state again that you are well supported, I may release my multiple emails between us where you claim severe resource deficiencies as a reason for not being able to handle compliance inquiries. \r\n\r\nThe FY 2022 NARA budget request for OGIS was \u201c$1,864 thousand for the Office of Government Information Services.\u201d  FY 2024 =  $1,963 thousand for the Office of Government Information Services; This is an increase of 5%, while inflation was 9.8%. No new request or \u201cjustification\u201d for increased personnel or resources. You people are struggling, agencies and requesters are adversely impacted. OGIS missions are statutory missions, which should go to the very top of NARA\u2019s priorities. You may expect to see this narrative when I publish my next written public comments and distribute them widely. I may distribute the attachments as well.\r\n\r\n--/\r\nYou also dodged the question about why you disable the YouTube comments. So, as my time permits, I will include the comments that I would have made into my next written public comments, which I distribute widely. You know me. You  knew that I would do this. So, unless you want to continue to appear unethical and foolish, I suggest that you \u201cstraighten up and fly right.\u201d [To improve one's behavior or attitude and perform better.]\r\n\r\n--/\r\nGAO again. As you complete your audit of FOIA backlogs, you must include that the source data is massively false \u2013 as demonstrated by my multiple written public comments. https://www.documentcloud.org/app?q=%2Buser%3Arobert-hammond-106693%20 . One question for agencies is for them to identify their processes for FOIA reporting and why every year they change their annual FOIA report data for the preceding year. DOJ OIP FOIA.gov quarterly and annual FOIA data is massively false and everyone knows it. So much for adequate DOJ OIP funding. \r\n--/\r\n\r\nWith my respect,\r\n\r\nRobert (Bob) Hammond\r\nPrivate Citizen FOIA Advocate\r\n\r\nFrom: foiacompliance@gmail.com <foiacompliance@gmail.com> \r\nSent: Tuesday, September 5, 2023 7:11 PM\r\nTo: foiacompliance@gmail.com\r\nCc: [Hammond]; [ ]@gao.gov; \r\n\r\nSubject: RE: OGIS & DOJ OIP Funding + GAO+ DOJ OIP, NARA FPL, and NARA Unauthorized Records Destruction (UD,) NARA OIG (Complaint).

RE - NGC23-504_Final_Response\r\nImportance: High\r\n\r\nGreetings FOIA Advisory Committee members!\r\nPlease see attached and below.\r\nThe crux of this matter is that NARA\u2019s OGIS impermissibly altered the June 8, 2023 certified meeting transcripts to remove my questions about the needed level of funding for OGIS and DOJ OIP to execute their missions, which Ms. Semo refused to address. Then, Ms. Semo omitted that material question from the certified meeting minutes.\r\nNARA appears to have run afoul of multiple federal laws and DOJ OIP policy, which I am addressing aggressively \u2013 attempting to halt this abuse.\r\nAdditionally, NARA redacted the identities of those who registered for the meeting under exemption B6 (Privacy), while NARA/DOJ OIP provide complete listings for Chief FOIA Officer Council meetings.\r\nFinally, NARA claims that it cannot locate any records of the all-panelist chat comments, which they are required to preserve under FACA and the FOIA Advisory Committee Bylaws. I have recommended (among other changes) that the bylaws be changed to include the list of participants. \r\nI know that you are all extremely busy (as am I). I am sending you examples of [seemingly] gross malfeasance in FOIA processes for information, because I believe that the greatest benefit of this Committee\u2019s term is to address the day-to-day issues that FOIA requesters \u2013 particularly private requester without the benefit of extensive legal staffs- experience every day.\r\nYou are doing extraordinary work \u2013 particularly with the B5 model letter. Later, I will provide input for doing the same thing with Exemption B6, which is equally abused \u2013 often with B5 applied to the same redaction withholding. Clarity in the determination letters of what the standards are for each claimed exemption and how the agency purports to have met the standards \u2013 along with a clear articulation of exactly what the foreseeable harm is- are paramount in leveling the playing field and discouraging frivolous redaction/withholding.\r\n--/\r\nNew subject. \r\nAs you know I have been advocating for increased funding for OGIS and DOJ OIP for years, while NARA and DOJ refuse to seek such additional funding in their budgets.\r\nMy new idea is to remove FOIA compliance oversight and auditing from OGIS and DOJ OIP and transfer those functions to GAO (in coordination with Congress) with direct funding from Congress. Then, OGIS and DOJ OIP keep their same funding with reduces missions. OGIS mediation mission conflicts with FOIA compliance (and OGIS disclaims any responsibility for compliance), while DOJ OIP is the appellate authority for DOJ and defends federal agencies in FOIA litigation. OGIS would instantly double the staff available for mediation.\r\nOversight/audit of executive branch functions is an appropriate GAO mission and GAO is routinely asked to conduct FOIA audits. Perhaps, some OGIS and OIP personnel would transfer to GAO, but I think OGIS and OIP should keep their budgets intact. We may find support in Congress for this given the combative FOIA hearings every couple of years. \r\n--/\r\nWith my respect,\r\n\r\nRobert (Bob) Hammond\r\nPrivate Citizen FOIA Advocate\r\n\r\nFrom: [Hammond]\r\nSent: Tuesday, September 5, 2023 5:15 PM\r\nTo: 'OIP.ComplianceInquiry@usdoj.gov' <OIP.ComplianceInquiry@usdoj.gov>; 'bobak.Talebian@usdoj.gov' <bobak.Talebian@usdoj.gov>; 'lindsay.Steel@usdoj.gov' <lindsay.Steel@usdoj.gov>; 'unauthorizeddisposition@nara.gov' <unauthorizeddisposition@nara.gov>; 'archivistoftheunitedstates@nara.gov' <archivistoftheunitedstates@nara.gov>\r\nCc: 'NARA General Counsel FOIA Office' <foia@nara.gov>; 'ashley.bryan@nara.gov' <ashley.bryan@nara.gov>; 'Vanita.Gupta; 'bobak.Talebian@usdoj.gov' <bobak.Talebian@usdoj.gov>; 'sheena.burrell@nara.gov' <sheena.burrell@nara.gov>; 'alina.semo@nara.gov' <alina.semo@nara.gov>\r\nSubject: DOJ OIP, NARA FPL, and NARA Unauthorized Records Destruction (UD,) NARA OIG (Complaint).

NARA knows that I participated, because they ready my question from the \u201call panelist chat\u201d as cited above. Meanwhile, NARA cited as present \u201cGretchen Gehrke, public commenter,\u201d while omitting all others who logged in to the meeting via WEBEX.\r\n\r\n8.\tImpermissible B6 Redactions. In NARA\u2019s responsive record xxx NARA redacted the identities of those who registered for the meeting, including \u201cGretchen Gehrke, public commenter.\u201d\r\na.\tThere is no expectation of privacy for members of the public participating in an open FOIA meeting.\r\nb.\tThe FACA and FOIA Advisory Committee Bylaws require that such records be preserved and made available to the public.

NARA\u2019s response letter improperly truncates my FOIA request records sought early into the third paragraph (stating\u2026) and completely omitted material records of paragraphs four. See my attached : Expedited FOIA Request NARA 23-F. Muckrock. FOIA Advisory Committee June 8, 2023 Chat Comments. \r\na.\tPresumably, NARA did not like the content or intend to reply.\r\nb.\tParagraph three lists persons who participated in the meeting including redacting \u201cGretchen Gehrke, public commenter,\u201d which NARA redacted in its released June_8.2023_FAC_Meeting_Attendee_Summary_-_Redaction_Proposals records \r\nc.\tNARA\u2019s reply creates an official record for appeal and judicial review. In litigation, agencies refer to such agency created records rather than the original records, thereby misleading the courts.\r\nd.\tSee my public comments to the FOIA Advisory Committee, \u201cDraft Proposed Model Agency B5 Determination Letter - Comment #2\u201d at DocumentCloud  https://www.documentcloud.org/app?q=%2Buser%3Arobert-hammond-106693%20 \r\n\r\n10.\tUnlawful Withholding.  Without any basis for withholding (because there is none), NARA impermissibly withheld.\r\n\r\n11.\tSeemingly materially false official statement #2 \u2013 certified meeting minutes. \u201cMs. Mitchell stated that Committee chat comments have been read into the record and reiterated the comment from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission FOIA professional about the Exemption 5 privilege issue that a global policy of citing the specific privilege would create efficiencies across government. Mr. Levenson confirmed that there were no additional chat comments.\u201d\r\n\r\na.\tClearly, the statement, \u201cCommittee chat comments have been read into the record\u201d is materially false. \r\nb.\tClearly, the statement, \u201cMr. Levenson confirmed that there were no additional chat comments.\u201d is materially false.\r\n\r\nWith my respect,\r\n\r\nRobert Hammond\r\n\r\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Daniel Ellsberg. Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

I see that in the reply that contains these previously released documents, additional records that are responsive to my request exist. I am writing to confirm within the allotted thirty day window that this material does not satisfy my request as most of the documents are more than forty years old, and many are much older. I understand that Dr. Daniel Ellsberg continued to be of interest to the FBI long after the early 1980s. I request that the additional records about my requested subject be processed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in this matter.",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\n1 - I have never requested a record from your agency before. Thank you for your consideration to others in previous requests submitted via the MuckRock platform, but I was not involved. I have no expectation that requests will always be free. On the contrary, I am very familiar with the search/retrieval/redaction fees permitted by statute and expect they will be assessed. That is not the case here.\r\n\r\n2 - Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 30-4-30(B), regarding copy fees, they \"may not apply to records that are transmitted in an electronic format\". Attempting to charge paper copy fees for an electronic record is clearly prohibited, whether or not they are \"agency copy\" fees or copies provided to the requester.\r\n\r\n3 - Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 30-4-30(B), fees may be assessed for \"search, retrieval, or redaction of records\". Certainly redacting electronic records electronically is more efficient and cost-effective. Fees must be \"reasonable\" and \"the records must be furnished at the lowest possible cost to the person requesting the records\". The statute does not permit the assessment of fees to satisfy an internal mandate of filing all records related to FOIA requests on paper. \r\n\r\n4 - Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 30-4-50(A)(2), \"administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public\" are inherently public record. I am unclear as to what information would even be subject to redaction in the requested records. If any redaction is required, the charge would be for the staff time to perform the redactions, not for paper copies of the record or for time spent researching what content is exempt.\r\n\r\n5 - I will go ahead and request a full waiver of all fees now. The policies and procedures of a law enforcement agency are of paramount public interest and these records will be made available to the public. As previously noted, the three other large law enforcement agencies in the county already publish their policies on their respective web sites at no charge. I am not aware of any redactions any of these agencies have made. Perhaps the Sheriff would be interested in bringing CCSO's level of transparency up to the level of neighboring departments? She stated in a press conference less than a week ago \"...we care about policing, transparency, and the safety of this community\".\r\n\r\nMount Pleasant Police Department's Policies/Procedures are 740 pages and 20.5MB. A reasonable estimate of the size of CCSO's policies based on the quoted 1683 pages is 46.62MB, but let's just say it's 100MB for simplicity. A 128GB USB drive is $12 on Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-Flair-128GB-Flash/dp/B015CH1PJU?th=1). Instead of printing the 1683 pages and producing a paper file for ~$336, you can use this USB drive for $12, use it to file all records related to this request, and still have room on the USB drive for 4.7 million more pages! Imagine how many trees (and FOIA requesters' and taxpayers' money) you can save! Demonstrating my commitment to a practical solution, I offer to cover the cost of the USB drive's storage space for the portion utilized for this request - 9/10ths of one cent (I'll round it up).\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response and an amicable resolution. Thanks,\r\n\r\nPatrick Wells",

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 134 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 523 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,335 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 1,875 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) FBI-Information Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4593\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Upon completion, the records are forwarded to a supervisor for review, if approved, a release will be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s FOI/PA Program is searching the FBI\u2019s indices for potentially responsive documents.

Name Employee ID Badge/star number Date of hire at MPD All previous employing agencies\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon review, as the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) does not capture the \"All previous employing agencies\" of such employees in a readily searchable electronic database, such a request would require an inordinate amount of manual research to locate and collect the requested information among thousands of files and records, and would either require the creation of new records to compile and assemble such information, or the review and redaction of a large volume of otherwise nonresponsive material.  As this request asks for an unreasonable volume of research , and associated processing that is not required under the FOIA, on behalf of the requester, we are not able to further process this request.  That is, we are not able to perform a reasonable and adequate search for specific records.  Therefore, this is not a \"perfected\" request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the District of Columbia (DC) FOIA, DC Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-531-539, provides that while a person has the right to request access to existing records, it does not require agencies to do research, analyze data, answer written questions, or create records to respond to a FOIA request.  I note, however, that a listing of District of Columbia (DC) employees (including MPD officers), salary, agency and job titles, and other data can be accessed at Public Employee Salary Information | DCHR<https://dchr.dc.gov/node/821352>).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, even if a reasonable and adequate search could be performed with either the creation of new records to compile and assemble such information, or the review and redaction of a large volume of otherwise nonresponsive material, the records you seek are subject to withholding pursuant to D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-534 (a)(2), which covers information of a personal nature, the release of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  Such privacy information includes names/personal identifiers and other personal privacy information, including that which may lead to the identity of individuals, in combination with \"previous employing agencies\".  Other FOIA exemptions may also apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease know that, under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR \u00a7 412, you have the right to appeal this letter to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.  If you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal\" or \"FOIA Appeal\" in the subject line of the letter as well on the outside of the envelope.  The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request; (2) a copy of any written denial; (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and/or arguments advanced in support of disclosure; and (4) a daytime telephone number, an e-mail and/or U.S. mailing address at which you can be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be mailed to:  The Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel, FOIA Appeal, 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 407, Washington, D.C.  20004.  Electronic versions of the same information can instead be e-mailed to The Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel at foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov>.  Further, a copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to the Freedom of Information Officer of the involved agency, or to the agency head of that agency, if there is no designated Freedom of Information Officer there.  Failure to follow these administrative steps will result in delay in the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal to the Mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBob Eckert\r\n\r\nFOIA Specialist\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act Office\r\n\r\nMetropolitan Police Department\r\n\r\nDistrict of Columbia\r\n\r\nRobert.eckert@dc.gov<mailto:Robert.eckert@dc.gov>\r\n\r\n\"Excellence is transferable.\"",

I am surprised to learn that Sound Transit and INIT are engaging the third-party notice and TRO process at this stage, and wanted to clarify the intent behind this request.  My intent was to learn which documents INIT and Sound Transit consider to be secret under RCW 42.56.540 -- not to request the secret documents themselves.  I understand, from experience, how much of a hassle the RCW 42.56.540 procedure can be for everyone, and my entire goal was to avoid creating that hassle here.\r\n\r\nThat said, if Sound Transit and INIT consider the parameters of secrecy to be secret themselves, I suppose you know how to reach me with legal process.

I know the Agency is in possession of a large number of these documents and it is long over due for them to be presented to the public and the families of those affected.\r\n\r\nSS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer (from here on referred to as SS General) Hans Kammler Dr. Engineer (alternate mis-spellings of his name have been found in official files prior, so please expand searches). The SS General was in charge of numerous German special projects, THE J\u00c4GERSTAB, the rocket forces and underground production and research facilities. ALL captured by US forces in 1945 April and May 1945, These locations listed below were investigated fully, all content was documented, photographed, and much content, equipment, machinery, plane, rocket parts and research removed by US forces. By Air-force Intelligence, OSS, Army investigators, CIOS and several others. These locations were handed over to US forces on orders of General Hans Kammler on May 7, I also requesting release of ALL this documentation, the photographs, films and inventory lists created. Including reports made on this location and adjacent related locations.. \r\n\r\nFurthermore I request information about which US companies that the collected information and German research was handed over to. \r\n\r\nFurthermore I request ALL information about SS General Hans Kammler generated during and AFTER WW2. And all information regarding the SS Generals interactions with OSS agents, during the war and after, and Furthermore all documentation regarding the SS Generals life post- war. His interrogations and collaborations with US entities after 1945. And I request information of the SS Generals final resting place. \r\nGiven the nature of the German research and the SS Generals expertise it was eventually collected and or copied to CIA files, especially those hand overs from the OSS. \r\n\r\nThe Facilities I request ALL information to be released and de-classified on, are the following:\r\n\r\nAustria, St. Georgen Gusen (Near Linz) \r\nCode name: Bergkristall,B8 or Esche or Georgenm\u00fchle M\u00f6glegrube and the parallel underground production factory Kellerbau both run by the SS. Bergkristall was a huge underground factory and research system, producing mainly ME262 Jets and V2 Parts and other. Run by the SS with labor from local KZ camp Mauthausen. It was handed over to US Army troops in early May 1945, intact, SS General Kammler was there on May 4th. several weeks later it was handed over to the Russian army. it was surveyed, documented and filmed extensively by several US agencies, inventoried in detail. \r\nGerman organization Todt OT had it named as Object 503 and it has document file number 624 with Operational Group VI.\r\n\r\nAustria, Melk near Roggendorf and Loosdorf. \r\nCodename: Quarz I and II B8 or Melk, Organisation Todt reference number OT Nr. 505 and 519 code named Esche II it was a large underground tunnel system for production of various machinery for German and Austrian military production. \r\n\r\nGermany, Nordhausen, Niedersachswerfen, Wolffleben, Harztor. \r\nCode name: Dora Mittlebau I, Ellrich Mittlebau II, Harzungen Mittlebau III, other codenames for this underground tunnel complex: Mittlebau, Mittelwerk, Anhydrit, Kaolin, Eber, Kuckuck I, Zinnstein, Nordwerk, Hydra I, Hydra II. \r\nHuge underground tunnel system, consisting of several systems and entrances. for production of V2 rockets, V1 rockets, Jet air planes and parts. and other manufacturing. The System was captured by the US Army on 11 April 1945. It was extensively documented, photographed and video filmed, inventoried by all US and British intelligence and military intelligence, OSS, CIOS and ALSOS teams. Also congressional teams visited the site, and handed it over to Russian forces month later. after removing inventory and machinery, and documents. OT call names are: 5183, 518, 500. The location was handed over intact on orders of SS General Hans Kammler. none of this documentation have been released or declassified and I request this be done now. \r\n\r\nSeveral US CIOS reports on these subjects were released in part or not at all, these I also request in FULL unredacted, With ALL attached documents and photos.. the CIOS Report numbers requested are. XXXIII-38 and report number XXXII-17\r\n\r\nGermany, Jonastal, Ohrdruf, Arnstadt, Crawinkel, Codename SIII or Jonastal SIII. Huge underground tunnel system, underground, with several multi-stories underground bunkers and communication centrals. (AMT 800 and AMT 10) Also 25 unfinished tunnels were found in the Jonas Valley. However on the adjacent German proving ground  experimental test sites were found for Nuclear weapons. remains were found, witnesses interviewed and entrances to large underground facilities were found and investigated by US army personnel, later documented by various Intelligence agencies and military Intelligence, OSS and ALSOS teams. Including the FULL report of the ALSOS teams findings at the nearby and related Nuclear Reactor site at the school building in Stadt-Ilm under command of Scientist Kurt Dibner. and actively covered before handing over of the area to the Russian army. The area was liberated April 4 1945 by the US army (4th Armored and 89th ID). I request all documentation of what was found, documented, filmed, inventoried and removed from these locations. This location was also under the command of SS General Hans Kammler. \r\n\r\nI respectfully request all the above information which in short is all information about SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer  Hans Kammler, the Bergkristall, Quarz, Dora Mittlebau tunnel factories and Jonastal SIII. Still much of the information, documentation, reports and photographic documentation on the General and the Tunnel factories have never been fully declassified, or released to the public. this information is 79 years old, it should have been released long ago, and the strategic or military value of what was found can no longer hold any importance. I am requesting this to be released on behalf of history and the families involved, including the Kammler Family. \r\n\r\nIf you need further documentation or report references please contact me for these. \r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nTino Struckmann\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTino Von Struckmann",

        "communication": "Dear Tino Von Struckmann,\r\n\r\nThis is in response to your February 14, 2024 Freedom of Information Act\r\nrequest (#24-24698) about \u201call information about SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer (SS\r\nGeneral) Hans Kammler, the Bergkristall, Quarz, Dora Mittlebau tunnel\r\nfactories and Jonastal SIII.\u201d We received your request in the Textual\r\nReference Branch at the National Archives in College Park, MD (Archives II)\r\non February 15, 2024.\r\n\r\nWe make reasonable efforts to assist researchers with their work. As a\r\nmatter of policy, the National Archives is staffed to assist researchers\r\nwith their work, including but not limited to pointing researchers to\r\nhelpful finding aids to begin their research. However, given the\r\nlimitations on staff resources, we do not generally conduct substantive\r\nresearch in response to requests filed under the Freedom of Information\r\nAct, except in circumstances where documents are easily locatable.\r\n\r\nYour request primarily consists of a stated topic rather than describing\r\nspecific documents, and therefore is not reasonably specific enough for us\r\nto be in a position to easily locate documents responsive to your request.\r\nA preliminary search of the finding aids that are available to us reveals\r\nthat your request could contain information in a number of series in\r\nvarious record groups.\r\n\r\nFor example, European Name Index to the Series \"Case Files, 1944-1949\"\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1683246> (entry A1 142) in the Records of\r\nthe Office of the Judge Advocate General (Army) (Record Group 153) and\r\nlocated one card for \"Kammler, Dr.\" (see image 1039)\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/166832179?objectPage=1039> that might be\r\nof interest to you. This index has been digitized and may be viewed online\r\nusing the National Archives Catalog link provided. The card for Dr. Kammler\r\nincludes the case file number 110-10. That file is located in box 101 of\r\nthe series Set-Up Files, 1944\u20131949 <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1692305>\r\n(entry A1 145) in Record Group 153. Although the Set-Up Files have not been\r\ndigitized, they are already open and available for researchers to access\r\nwithout submitting a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Please\r\nemail the Textual Reference staff at Archives II at\r\narchives2reference@nara.gov for more information about these records.\r\n\r\nThe National Archives Collection of World War II War Crimes Records (Record\r\nGroup 238) also includes multiple references to Hans Kammler\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/search?q=%22Hans%20Kammler%22&recordGroupNumber=238>\r\nand Kammler, Hans\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/search?q=%22Kammler%2C%20Hans%22&recordGroupNumber=238>\r\nin several series related to Case No. 4, United States v. Oswald Pohl, et\r\nal. These records have been digitized and may be viewed online using the\r\nCatalog links provided.\r\n\r\nNext, we searched the non-digitized Personal Name Index, as well as the\r\nIndex to the Director\u2019s Files (Microfilm Publication 1642), to the Records\r\nof the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) (Record Group 226), but we were\r\nunable to find any reference to Hans Kammler in these indexes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, National Archives Record Group 319: Records of the Army Staff\r\ncontains Investigatory Records Repository (IRR) files accessioned by the\r\nNational Archives from the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command\r\n(USAINSCOM). The IRR files are military intelligence and Counter\r\nIntelligence Corps (CIC) files maintained by USAINSCOM and its\r\npredecessors. The primary IRR series in our custody include:\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Intelligence and Investigative Dossiers Impersonal Files\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/576906> (entry A1 134A)\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Selected Printouts of Digital Intelligence and Investigative Dossiers\r\n   from Impersonal Files <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/6705484> (entry\r\n   ZZ 6)\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Intelligence and Investigative Dossiers Personal Files\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/645054> (entry A1 134, A1 134B)\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Selected Printouts of Digital Intelligence and Investigative Dossiers\r\n   (Personal Files) <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/12191624> (entry ZZ 5)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have carefully searched the finding aids available to us, but we were\r\nunable to locate any references to Hans Kammler among these records.\r\n\r\nYou may also wish to search for relevant records within these series in the\r\nRecords of the Central Intelligence Agency (Record Group 263):\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   First Release of Name Files Under the Nazi War Crimes and Japanese\r\n   Imperial Government Disclosure Acts, ca. 9/18/1947 - 1999\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/573459> (Entries A1 86 and ZZ 16); not\r\n   digitized\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Second Release of Name Files Under the Nazi War Crimes and Japanese\r\n   Imperial Government Disclosure Acts, ca. 1981 - ca. 2002\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/640446> (Entries A1 88 and ZZ 18);\r\n   digitized in full\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   First Release of Subject Files Under the Nazi War Crimes and Japanese\r\n   Imperial Government Disclosure Acts, ca. 9/18/1947 - 2002\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/574143> (Entries A1 87 and ZZ 17); not\r\n   digitized\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Second Release of Subject Files Under the Nazi War Crimes and Japanese\r\n   Imperial Government Disclosure Acts, ca. 1981 - ca. 2003\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/640447> (Entries A1 89 and ZZ 19);\r\n   digitized in full\r\n\r\n\r\nPlus, we located the file CIOS Reports: XXXIII-38, 21 - Underground\r\nFactories in Germany <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/2152276> in box 693\r\nand the file CIOS Reports: XXXII-17, 4 - Underground Factories in Central\r\nGermany <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/2152133> in box 686 of the\r\nseries Publications\r\nFiles, 1950\u20131951 (\"P File\") <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/656424> (entry\r\nNM-3 82, UD 82-A) in Record Group 319. These records have not been\r\ndigitized.\r\n\r\nThe non-digitized records outlined above are open and available for\r\nresearchers to access in the Textual Research Room at Archives II. We will\r\nbe happy to make these records available in our research rooms should you\r\nhave an opportunity to visit the National Archives. We recommend scheduling\r\nan advanced consultation before scheduling a research visit; working with a\r\nreference consultant will help you better prepare for your visit. Please\r\ncontact archives2reference@nara.gov to schedule an advanced consultation.\r\n\r\nYou may use the National Archives Catalog <https://catalog.archives.gov/>\r\nto search for additional, potentially relevant records. For example, we\r\nlocated multiple records related to Underground Factories\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/search?page=1&q=%22underground%20factories%22>\r\nthat might be of interest to you. Please see Using the National Archives\r\nCatalog <https://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/help/using> and National\r\nArchives Catalog Search Tips\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/help/search-tips> for guidance.\r\nSome records may be digitized and available online using the Catalog, but\r\nmany records have not been digitized. Please contact the NARA reference\r\nunit listed in each Catalog description for assistance with those\r\nparticular records.\r\n\r\nYou could also hire a researcher to conduct research on your behalf. A list\r\nof private researchers who are familiar with National Archives facilities\r\nis available on our website at\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/research/hire-help/index.html.\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this a denial of your FOIA request.

Electronic copies of any/all RECORDS AND WRITINGS regarding the Washington\u2019s Council of School Attorneys (COSA) \"COSA listserv\" as described on the Washington State School Directors\u2019 Association (WSSDA) website: https://wssda.org/council-of-school-attorneys/.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS        *** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

        "communication": "Dear Department of Treasury:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nThis request covers every Department of Treasury component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc., that has a Chief FOIA Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, or substantially equivalent position. See \"# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\" below.\r\n\r\nAt your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7). \r\n \r\nIn particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is part of an all-agency FOIA audit. Your performance will be tracked, analyzed, and published.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful patterns or practices discovered in the course of this audit will be highlighted for public shaming, and will likely be litigated for permanent injunctions.\r\n\r\nAny particularly good performance will, by the same token, be highlighted for public praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Primary request\r\n\r\nA. FOIA administrative record in matters with successful administrative appeal\r\n\r\nI hereby request:\r\n\r\n1. The entire administrative record in FOIA matters which involved a successful administrative appeal, as defined below. \r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nI believe that these records are of substantial public interest, because they would reveal:\r\n* how the FOIA administrative appeals process works in practice, e.g. what kinds of arguments are successful on administrative appeal, what actions are taken by the appealed-to entity, what kinds of relief are granted, and why;\r\n* whether such aspects of FOIA administrative appeals are consistent, both within and between agencies, which cannot be determined except by a broad comparison across many instances;\r\n* effects of OGIS mediation on administrative appeals;\r\n* the extent to which agencies comply with the administrative appeals process (or don't), e.g. in responding to requests made by the appealed-to entity, or obeying their decisions; \r\n* policy/pattern/practice violations which cannot be determined except by a broad comparison across many instances, to detect repeated violations (as determined by the appealed-to entity) that an agency has not systemically corrected; and\r\n* courts' responses, and agencies' Vaughn filings, in the context of successful administrative appeals.\r\n\r\nI believe that the records should be very easy to locate, because virtually all of them should be in the possession or control of the agency's FOIA office itself. (Of course, it is the entire agency, not merely its FOIA office, to whom the legal standards of FOIA apply, including \"possession or control\", \"reasonably described\", etc. This is simply a comment about the extremely convenient access to the records requested.)\r\n\r\n## Definitions\r\n\r\nFOIA provides for administrative appeals. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) (notice), (a)(6)(A)(ii) (procedure), & (a)(6)(E)(ii)(II) (expedition).\r\n\r\nThe procedural terms used in this request should be interpreted broadly, according to the following definitions.\r\n\r\nThe \"appealed-to entity\" is typically the agency's chief FOIA officer. However, some agencies (like DHS) outsource their appeals to another entity (e.g. for DHS, to the Coast Guard Office of the Chief Administrative Law Judge).\r\n\r\nAn \"adverse determination\", as used in this request, means whatever a requester appealed about. This includes both a formal response under (a)(6)(A)(i), and any other issue raised on the appeal. This specifically includes \"administrative closure\", failure to respond, etc., regardless of whether the agency deems it a \"determination\" or \"adverse\".\r\n\r\nAn \"administrative appeal\", as used in this request, includes any attempt to use the administrative appeals process. It does not include OGIS mediation (which isn't an appeal), nor llitigation (which isn't administrative). However, it does include requests made to the appealed-to entity or to the agency, styled or otherwise clearly intended to be an appeal, regardless of whether the agency agrees with that characterization, if the appealed-to entity took any action in response.\r\n\r\nAn appeal is \"successful\", as used in this request, if the appealed-to entity:\r\n* agrees with the requester;\r\n* disagrees with the initial adverse determination;\r\n* remands to the agency or reverses the agency;\r\n* orders, requests, or otherwise indicates that the agency should do or not do anything;\r\n* overrides any part of the original adverse determination; or\r\n* anything other than complete agreement with the initial adverse determination, and complete dismissal of the appeal, as the appealed-to entity's only response to the appeal.\r\n\r\nThe \"administrative record\", as used in this request, includes everything that is administrative record for the request, appeal, or OGIS mediation, as well as key parts of any ensuing litigation, such as:\r\n* the request;\r\n* follow-up communication to or from the requester, or OGIS, including determinations, close-out letters, releases, etc.;\r\n* the appeal;\r\n* all communication to or from the appealed-to entity; \r\n* all ensuing communications, determinations, re-appeals, etc.; \r\n* any complaint, Vaughn filing, opinion, or order in ensuing litigation;\r\n* all administrative record resulting from any ensuing litigation, e.g. after court remand;\r\n* all attachments to all of the above; and\r\n* all metadata for all of the above (see provisions below).\r\n\r\n## Priority\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize records in the following order:\r\n1. communication to or from the appealed-to entity (i.e. breadth first, limited to the successful appeal), further prioritized as:\r\n  a. administrative appeal orders and opinions of remand or reversal;\r\n  b. other such appeal communication records;\r\n2. all record in a given matter (i.e. completeness of record in a given matter); and\r\n3. most recent matters (by date of successful administrative appeal decision).\r\n\r\n## Dual track processing\r\n\r\nI request that you process priority 1(a) records \u2014 remands & reversals \u2014 under the \"simple request\" track.\r\n\r\nI agree that the remaining records are \"complex request\" track.\r\n\r\nPlease note e.g. the provisions below regarding rolling updates. \r\n\r\n### \r\nFiat Fiendum FOIA template \r\nVersion 5.1\r\n###\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n5.1: Updated 508 provisions to refer to Access Board's final rule, 82 FR 5790, and reference https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov .\r\n\r\n# FOIA template structure\r\n\r\nAll content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, \u00a7 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  \r\n\r\nPlease read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Template version updates\r\n\r\nIf you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional FOIA requests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\"All parts of the record\" means that the \"record\" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:\r\na) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);\r\nb) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;\r\nc) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;\r\nd) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; \r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Related database records\" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 2\", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"[Alice's cell #]\". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1. See https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov/ .\r\n\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\n\u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Sai: \r\nThank you for your email concerning the status of your Freedom of Information Act request.  Currently, your request is in the review queue. \r\nTreasury Departmental Offices processes FOIA requests in a multi-track system, which identifies a request as simple or complex, and generally processes each request on a first-in, first-out basis.  Your request is considered complex.  During the last fiscal year, complex requests were processed on average within 347 business days.  Based upon this, I estimate that we will be able to complete your request by June 20, 2024.\u00a0 The amount of time that will be required to process requests varies greatly and depends on a number of factors including how many offices or custodians will need to be searched, whether the records you have requested are easily accessible, whether the records are electronic or hard copies, the volume of records located, the classification level of the records, and whether or not consultations with other Federal agencies are required. \r\nThank you, \r\nReNay Royster FOIA@treasury.gov",

In our search for potentially responsive documents, several litigation reports attached to emails were pulled. These reports range from 30 to 60 pages each. The keywords \"NextEra,\" \"MBTA,\" \"bald eagles,\" and \"golden eagles\" come up on only one or two pages of the lengthy reports, and the rest of the report is not responsive to your request because they do not contain any of the keywords whatsoever. We want to provide adequate and responsive documents to you, so would you be willing to exclude these reports? Alternatively, would you agree for us to release only portions that mention the keywords (subject to applicable exemptions) and to redact the rest of the report that does not mention the keywords?\r\n\r\nThanks very much.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMaiuyen Lenguyen\n",

We note that the requests are limited only to records in our custody and control.\r\nThe Alameda County Sheriff's Office is in the process of searching for responsive, non-exempt data regarding your request.  After review, we will have a cost estimate for you (if any), and upon receipt of payment from you (if any), we will produce these materials.  If deemed necessary, we may have to produce on a rolling basis. We estimate the search to be complete within three weeks.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your requests, ACSO asserts that certain documents requested may be exempt from disclosure pursuant to Government Code Sections 7927.500, 7927.200, 7927.700, 7923.600-7923.625, 7927.705, 7922.000, 7922.540(a) and possibly additional subsections, and Government Code Sections. ACSO also asserts, certain documents; potentially responsive to your requests, may be shielded by the attorney work product doctrine and the attorney client privilege. Further, some documents may contain confidential information that is protected by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Additional privileges may apply based on a review of the records.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D9EBE9.D37B49C0]\r\nCynthia Wilson | Sheriff's Technician #235\r\nAlameda County Sheriff's Office\r\n\r\nInternal Affairs | 3 Park Pl., 3rd Floor, Dublin, CA 94568",

However, the names of attachments are redacted in the emails (with the exception of agency logos), making it impossible to link which attachments that were produced go with which emails. Nor does the redaction of attachment names in emails correspond to the exceptions cited for redaction in your response (Cal. Gov. Code \u00a7\u00a77927.500 and 7927.705), which address state law prohibitions and draft documents. In any case, the redaction of attachment names is inconsistent with the disclosure of the attachments themselves. \r\n\r\nPlease re-review the emails that were produced and reverse the redaction of attachment names.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requestor:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe reviewed your request for \"Emails with representatives of the New York University Policing Project from 2021 to present\u2026emails sent to or received from an email address with the domain \"@nyu.edu\" or \"@policingproject.org\" that were sent between 01/01/2021 and 03/05/2023.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA search was conducted and responsive records have been released to you.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease note that some of the records contain minimal redactions to protect information that is exempt from disclosure under express provisions of the California Public Records Act, including California Government Code Sections 7922.000, 7923.600, 7927.200, and 7928.300.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

They also said:\r\n\r\n\"You may wish to direct your search to the New York City Office of Technology and Innovation\".\r\n\r\nHence, I am expecting relevant records from this agency.\r\n\r\nNow that more than two years have passed since I began this effort, I have considerably less patience for illegal delays. I wish to be as clear as I can be about this: I have no ill will whatsoever for the likely-overworked records access employees, but for the agencies which make it difficult to do your jobs in a timely manner. You may expect me to appeal on grounds of constructive denial should the request be illegally delayed.\r\n\r\nThe request for records, which I am now directing to this agency is:\r\nRecords relating to the total number of restaurants inspected for compliance with state pandemic air filtration and ventilating guidance.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed portable filtration or UVGI instead of MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that were operating the installed filtration or UVGI systems when inspected. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have other mitigation measures in place, when MERV 13 filtration, UVGI, and portable filtration, was not in place. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the number restaurants that have been found to be or are currently out of compliance with air filtration and ventilating guidance. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould no such records exist, I request information on what records and/or statistics are collected regarding air filtration and ventilating guidance enforcement.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, should they be available, records of the actual inspections and results.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I'm very glad to finally be getting real data - it's been three years of chasing various agencies to get this.\r\n\r\nI do have several questions.\r\n\r\nThe filename includes the word \"redacted\", but it's an excel spreadsheet, so I obviously can't see any markup. Can you tell me what's been redacted?\r\n\r\nAre there any descriptions or notes available in city records for the columns?\r\n\r\nWho was the records holder/owner for this dataset? Who was responsible for maintaining it.\r\n\r\nThere are easily tens of thousands of establishments for which many fields are empty. Is data missing? Have those fields been withheld?\r\n\r\nOne local establishment, the Beach Cafe on 2nd, has yes entries for symptom screening, soap, and many related surface sanitation checks, but empty fields for ventilation and filtration checks. I don't see a yes or no - just blank.\r\n\r\nSome establishments that should be in this dataset appear to be missing. I'm using my my favorite pizza place as a sanity check, pizza park on 1233 first avenue, and am struggling to find it. Is there any reason it would be missing or withheld?",

The only redactions in this dataset were columns that contained personally identifying information like names, phone numbers, email addresses, and so on. No row-level information has been redacted. Where a field is blank, that's not a redaction: the underlying dataset did not contain data for that field.\r\n\r\nWe can search for a data dictionary, and we'll get back in touch.\r\n\r\nAs regards Pizza Park, we did not redact or otherwise remove any row-level data from the spreadsheet we sent you. The spreadsheet is a record of various inspections performed by various agencies during the time period specified. OTI wasn't one of those agencies, so we don't have records of why any specific business was or was not inspected.\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nDominic",
