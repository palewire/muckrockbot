        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am requesting records related to the case of Tyler W. Massengill, who was charged with setting fire to a Planned Parenthood clinic in Illinois, as reported in the article referenced here: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/illinois-man-charged-setting-fire-planned-parenthood.\r\n\r\nIn order to assist with locating the records, I request that a search be conducted for all records related to Tyler W. Massengill and any associated individuals or organizations involved in the incident. I further request that this search be conducted across all relevant offices, divisions, and agencies, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) indices.\r\n\r\nTo narrow the scope of the search, I request that the following key strings be used in the search for responsive records: \"Tyler W. Massengill\", \"Planned Parenthood\", and \"fire\". I also request that this search be conducted for records from January 1, 2021 to the date this request is processed.\r\n\r\nI request that all responsive records be provided in their entirety, without redaction or deletion, unless such redaction or deletion is necessary to protect classified information, personal privacy, or other legally protected interests. Please note that any such redaction or deletion will be subject to challenge and may be compelled in court.\r\n\r\nFinally, I request that this request be expedited due to the nature of the information sought and the public interest in disclosure. As a reference for expedited processing, I cite the case of American Civil Liberties Union v. FBI, 710 F.3d 422 (2013), which held that a delay in the release of information pertaining to government activity that is already in the public domain can result in a lack of trust in government officials, thereby hindering their ability to carry out their duties.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request an interagency search for responsive records, including any records that may be held by other agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\r\n\r\nTo assist in the search, I would like to request that the following key strings be used to identify potentially responsive records:\r\n\r\nTyler W. Massengill\r\nPlanned Parenthood arson\r\nIllinois\r\nI also request any Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) records, including but not limited to wiretaps, surveillance logs, and monitoring reports related to Tyler W. Massengill or the Planned Parenthood arson case.\r\n\r\nTo support this request, I would like to reference the article from the Department of Justice (DOJ) website titled \"Illinois Man Charged with Setting Fire to Planned Parenthood\". The article states that Tyler W. Massengill was charged with damaging and destroying a Planned Parenthood facility by means of fire on October 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to cite the following case law to support this FOIA request:\r\n\r\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Department of Defense, 628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011)\r\nNation Magazine v. United States Customs Service, 71 F.3d 885 (D.C. Cir. 1995)\r\nI request that this FOIA request be expedited due to the urgency and importance of the information sought. If any records are withheld, redacted, or deleted, I request a detailed explanation for each instance and the specific FOIA exemption(s) under which the information was withheld.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to remind you that any responsive records that are not provided will be subject to compulsory production in court. I look forward to your timely response and please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

Massengill/ Peoria Planned Parenthood arson.  Your request has been assigned number 2023-00936.  Please refer to this number on any future correspondence.  You are requesting information on a third party.  Disclosure of records relating to a third party is only permitted with the express authorization and written consent of the third party, proof of death of the third party, or a demonstration that the public interest in the disclosure outweighs the personal privacy interest of the third party.  Since you have not provided any documentation that would demonstrate your right to access the records of a third party, even to acknowledge the existence of such records pertaining to this individual would be in violation of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a and constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of his  personal privacy.  Therefore, I am refusing to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records.  Such a disclosure would constitute a violation of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a and the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C).  If you can obtain consent or provide proof of death, ATF may be able to release responsive documents should they exist.  In order to disclose information to you, you will need to have the individual verify his/her identity as required by Department regulation 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.41(d).  Specifically, if you would like this office to process your request and search for responsive records in this office, the individual will need to either (1) return a completed Form DOJ-361, Certification of Identity, to this office, or (2) provide a statement notarized or under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, indicating the individual\u2019s full name, place of birth, date of birth, and current address.  Please return either the Form DOJ-361 or the individual\u2019s notarized statement, along with your request, to the Information & Privacy Governance division.  You may mail your documents to 99 New York Avenue, NE, Room 4.E-301, Washington, DC 20226. In light of these circumstances, I am administratively closing your request in this office.For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison, Zina Kornegay, at (202) 648-7390, for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.
