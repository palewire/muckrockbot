As well as any enforcement documentation (including but not limited to policies, plans, or memorandums) on how noise data is stored and shared with the Department of Environmental Protection (and any other NY agencies including NYPD) for noise violation enforcement.\r\n\r\nTo help you locate your relevant records, here is public documentation online that this tool was designed by the design firm Loft LLC (now Nova and Loft Designs) and paid for with a $5 mil NSF grant. See the documentation below.\r\n\r\n* https://www.nyc.gov/assets/ddc/downloads/town-and-gown/SONYC.2%20Precis.FINAL.pdf\r\n* https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1544753\r\n\r\nI am a researcher looking to better understand how data informs strategic noise enforcement in NYC. I would appreciate these results as soon as possible and am happy to receive records on a rolling basis as they are made available. I am happy to discuss in more detail what I am looking for if helpful at rebecca@rebeccawilliams.info\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
