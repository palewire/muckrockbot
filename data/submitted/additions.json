        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nLast week, I submitted a request for records related to an incident on November 5th, where police responded to a report of an election judge striking another individual with a cane at a polling site. The locations associated with this incident are either 2700 N Sheffield Ave, Chicago, IL, 60614, or the intersection of W 63rd St & S Knox Ave, Chicago, IL, 60629. The original request sought the following: Incident Reports, 911 Audio, Dispatch Recordings, Body Cam Footage, and a CAD Log. However, the request was denied in full on the grounds of being overly broad in scope. I would like to emphasize that, under FOIA guidelines, if certain portions of a request are deemed too broad or are otherwise exempt, the department should not deny the request in full. Instead, the agency is obligated to produce any non-exempt records that are reasonably identifiable and within scope. Additionally, Incident Reports are a standard type of document routinely requested and disclosed by this agency. In fact, I have previously received such reports from the Chicago Police Department without the need for separate or narrowed requests. I respectfully request that this standard practice be applied to this case as well. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate this process, I am submitting a revised, narrower request:\r\n\r\nIncident Report: Any incident or police report(s) prepared in connection to a November 5th, where police responded to a report of an election judge striking another individual with a cane at a polling site. The locations associated with this incident are either 2700 N Sheffield Ave, Chicago, IL, 60614, or the intersection of W 63rd St & S Knox Ave, Chicago, IL, 60629.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Stat. \u00a719.35(1)(h). This is intended to prevent the records custodian from having to guess at what records a requester desires, and to avoid imposition of undue burdens on the university that would impair the functioning of the offices that need to be involved in processing a request. To the extent that the first part of your request, for \u201cany and all records and materials...\u201d constitutes a records request, it cannot be fulfilled because it does not identify a specific record or records in which you are interested in as required by Wis. Stat \u00a719.35(1)(h).\r\n\r\nIf you could specify what you are looking for, we would be happy to move forward with your request once you've specified. To assist you further, below is what we have previously released related to this case to other requesters:\r\n\r\nIncident report\r\nVideo and audio interviews with Khari Sandford and Alijah Larrue\r\n\r\n\r\nWould this meet the needs of your request?
