        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nIn the government's response to several other FOIA requests, hundreds and hundreds of pages of responsive records originating from the WHO were redacted under exemption (b)(5).\r\n\r\nFor example, an attachment in one such request titled \"WHO Confidential Situation Report, Saturday, 13 June 2020\", in an email from moffettd@who.int, sent on Saturday, June 13, 2020 4:24 AM.\r\n\r\nCountless other examples abound in the responsive records for other requests. GORAN call notes. Slide decks. Various reports and drafts of reports.\r\n\r\nIn Lucaj v. FBI, No. 16-1381 (6th Cir. 2017), The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled:\r\n\"Key to answering this question is the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that \u201cthe first condition of Exemption 5 is no less important than the second; the communication must be \u2018inter-agency or intra-agency.\u2019\u201d Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9. Indeed, the first condition here is all-important. However broad the term agency can be, see Anne Joseph O\u2019Connell, Bureaucracy at the Boundary, 162 U. Pa. L. Rev. 841 (2014), FOIA offers, for our purposes, a more limited \r\ndefinition: \u201c\u2018agency\u2019 means each authority of the Government of the United States.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1), cited in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(f)(1) (elaborating that \u201c\u2018agency\u2019 as defined in section 551(1) of this title includes any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency\u201d). So, to be inter-agency memorandums or letters, the RFAs must have been sent from an authority of the Government of the United States to an authority of the Government of the United States. The OIA, undoubtedly an authority of the Government of the United States, sent the RFAs to the Central Authority of Austria and an unnamed country, undoubtedly not authorities of the Government of the United States. The RFAs\u2019 recipients having failed to meet \r\nFOIA\u2019s definition of agency, we hold that the RFAs from the OIA to the Central Authority of Austria and the unnamed country are not inter-agency. And given that the RFAs are not intra-agency either, they may not be withheld under Exemption 5.\"\r\n\r\n...and later in the ruling:\r\n\"But in the end, Congress chose to limit the exemption\u2019s reach to \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5), not to \u201cmemorandums or letters among agencies, independent contractors, and entities that share a common interest with agencies.\u201d In view of our responsibility to \u201cnarrowly construe[]\u201d FOIA\u2019s exemptions, see Schell, 843 F.2d at 937 (quoting Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976)), our response today echoes that of the Supreme Court and Congress: however important it may be for the OIA to have frank communications with the Central Authority of Austria and an unnamed foreign government, however common the interest between the OIA and its international partners, the Central Authority of Austria and an unnamed foreign government are not, so far as Congress has defined the term, agencies. Therefore, the RFAs from the OIA to these countries are not \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters\u201d within the scope of Exemption 5.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this, all responsive communications to and from agencies of *foreign* governments must be released under the law, they may not be redacted or withheld under (b)(5). According to the court opinion, this applies no matter if they're deliberative, predecisional, or redactable under any (b)(5) privilege. If the NIH FOIA officers cannot provide a superseding court decision, they will be in violation of law. I am willing at this point to retain legal counsel.\r\n\r\nThis should include all manner of foreign documents previously incorrectly redacted or withheld under (b)(5), including but absolutely not limited to GORAN call notes, slide decks, various reports and drafts of reports, emails that were sent to many other recipients in addition to being to or from the NIH, and anything similar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo my great surprise, several responsive records in the aforementioned FOIA request (and other, similar, requests) appear to have been withheld entirely under (b)(4). GORAN call notes are one such record.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act explains of exemption 4:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The exemption also affords protection to those submitters who are required to furnish commercial or financial information to the government \r\nby safeguarding them from the competitive disadvantages that could result from disclosure.4 The exemption covers two distinct categories of information in federal agency records, (1) trade secrets, and (2) information that is (a) commercial or financial, and (b) obtained from a \r\nperson, and (c) privileged or confidential\"\r\n\r\n(And)\r\n\r\n\"The D.C. Circuit's decision in Public Citizen represented a distinct departure from what until then had been almost universally accepted by the courts -- that a \"trade secret\" encompasses virtually any information that provides a competitive advantage. In Public Citizen, a \"trade secret\" was more narrowly defined as \"a secret, commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing, compounding, or processing \r\nof trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial effort.\"8 This definition also incorporates a requirement that there be a \"direct relationship\" between the trade secret and the productive process.9\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI find it highly questionable that the GOARN call notes - about an ongoing disease outbreak - contain entirely \"commercial or financial\" text. I also find it wildly unlikely that the GOARN calls were only ever about the implementation of specific manufacturing techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn light of that knowledge, I am also requesting separately the following documents from the NIAID:\r\nAny and all communications between the NIAID, or related records between 1, December 2019, and 1 December 2021, involving:\r\n\r\nEmails to or from drtedros@who.int, or any other communications to or from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the WHO. Similarly for the following email addresses and individuals:\r\n\r\n\r\nvankerkhovem@who.int, Maria Van Kerkhove of \r\ngreint@who.int (Dr Thomas Grein)\r\nryanm@who.int (Mike Ryan)\r\nJeremy Farrar - chief scientist at the World Health Organization, may not be using who.int email address in official capacity\r\nsterng@who.int (Gabriellea Stern)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, broadly, any individuals and email addresses associated with the who.int top level domain.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, and separately, any individuals and email addresses of officials associated with the following top level domains:\r\n\r\n.sn\r\n.nl\r\n.uk\r\n.hk\r\ngov.ng\r\n.kr\r\n.ru\r\n.de\r\n.qa\r\n.ca\r\n.gov.cn\r\n.jp\r\n.gov.cr\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER RICCIO",

Please understand that the current scope, no email custodians being listed, and the absence of search terms are going to delay processing by years and also result in a lot of unnecessary records that will be reviewed for relevancy and responsiveness.\u00a0 We need more clarity on what records you seek to find, in order to provide materials sooner. \nIf you have any questions or wish to discuss the reformulation of your request, you may contact me, Qianna Norman, at Qianna.Norman@nih.gov.\u00a0 If you insist on keeping the request as written, it will remain on a \u201cfee-related hold\u201d until we determine a monetary amount of pre-payment that you will need to pay in order to start processing your request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nIn FY22 Q2, the following two FOIA requests were placed and later fulfilled:\r\n\r\n\r\nrequest for a complete and thorough search for records maintained by the CDC pertaining to the following employees: \u2022 Weigong Zhou, Medical Officer, Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases \u2022 Ray R. Arthur, Director of the Global Disease Detection Operations Center Part I. We request copies of records held created, received and/or in the possession of the CDC that reflect communications \u2013 whether in writing or verbal communications that were later reduced to writing (including any emails and their attachments, non-email correspondence, or other forms of communication) \u2013 to or from the above-named employees \u2013 including attachments, CC and BCC \u2013 and the following email addresses: 1. j.farrar@wellcome.ac.uk 2. collinsf@mail.nih.gov 3. afauci@niaid.nih.gov Part II. We request communications containing any of the following key words/phrases: ? \u201cWuhan Institute of Virology\u201d ? \u201cBaric\u201d ? \u201cGain-of-function\u201d ? \u201cGOF\u201d ? \u201cpassage through cell culture\u201d ? \u201cHuanan Market\u201d ? \u201cWet market\r\n\u2013\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, et seq., to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seeking the production of documents concerning communications with the World Health Organization about the origins of COVID-19 and/or SARS-CoV-2. We request a complete and thorough search for records maintained by the CDC pertaining to the following employees: \u2022 Weigong Zhou, Medical Officer, Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases \u2022 Ray R. Arthur, Director of the Global Disease Detection Operations Center Part I. We request copies of records held created, received and/or in the possession of the CDC that reflect communications \u2013 whether in writing or verbal communications that were later reduced to writing (including any emails and their attachments, non-email correspondence, or other forms of communication) \u2013 to or from the above-named employees \u2013 including attachments, CC and BCC \u2013 and the following email addresses: j.farrar@wellcome.ac.uk collinsf@mail.nih.gov afauci@niaid.nih.gov Part II. We request communications containing any of the following key words/phrases: \u201cWuhan Institute of Virology\u201d \u201cBaric\u201d \u201cGain-of-function\u201d \u201cGOF\u201d \u201cpassage through cell culture\u201d \u201cHuanan Market\u201d \u201cWet market\u201d The time period covered by this request is from February 1, 2020, to March 3, 2020. \r\n\r\nI am submitting this FOIA request anew, with a few changes. The aforementioned two requests are to be rerun, with the timeframe expanded to December 1, 2019 through December 1 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the government's response to that FOIA request, hundreds and hundreds of pages of responsive records originating from the WHO were redacted under exemption (b)(5).\r\n\r\nFor example, an attachment titled \"WHO Confidential Situation Report, Saturday, 13 June 2020\", in an email from moffettd@who.int, sent on Saturday, June 13, 2020 4:24 AM.\r\n\r\nCountless other examples abound in the responsive records. GORAN call notes. Slide decks. Various reports and drafts of reports.\r\n\r\nIn Lucaj v. FBI, No. 16-1381 (6th Cir. 2017), The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled:\r\n\"Key to answering this question is the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that \u201cthe first condition of Exemption 5 is no less important than the second; the communication must be \u2018inter-agency or intra-agency.\u2019\u201d Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9. Indeed, the first condition here is all-important. However broad the term agency can be, see Anne Joseph O\u2019Connell, Bureaucracy at the Boundary, 162 U. Pa. L. Rev. 841 (2014), FOIA offers, for our purposes, a more limited \r\ndefinition: \u201c\u2018agency\u2019 means each authority of the Government of the United States.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1), cited in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(f)(1) (elaborating that \u201c\u2018agency\u2019 as defined in section 551(1) of this title includes any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency\u201d). So, to be inter-agency memorandums or letters, the RFAs must have been sent from an authority of the Government of the United States to an authority of the Government of the United States. The OIA, undoubtedly an authority of the Government of the United States, sent the RFAs to the Central Authority of Austria and an unnamed country, undoubtedly not authorities of the Government of the United States. The RFAs\u2019 recipients having failed to meet \r\nFOIA\u2019s definition of agency, we hold that the RFAs from the OIA to the Central Authority of Austria and the unnamed country are not inter-agency. And given that the RFAs are not intra-agency either, they may not be withheld under Exemption 5.\"\r\n\r\n...and later in the ruling:\r\n\"But in the end, Congress chose to limit the exemption\u2019s reach to \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5), not to \u201cmemorandums or letters among agencies, independent contractors, and entities that share a common interest with agencies.\u201d In view of our responsibility to \u201cnarrowly construe[]\u201d FOIA\u2019s exemptions, see Schell, 843 F.2d at 937 (quoting Dep\u2019t of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 (1976)), our response today echoes that of the Supreme Court and Congress: however important it may be for the OIA to have frank communications with the Central Authority of Austria and an unnamed foreign government, however common the interest between the OIA and its international partners, the Central Authority of Austria and an unnamed foreign government are not, so far as Congress has defined the term, agencies. Therefore, the RFAs from the OIA to these countries are not \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters\u201d within the scope of Exemption 5.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this, all responsive communications to and from agencies of *foreign* governments must be released under the law, they may not be redacted or withheld under (b)(5). According to the court opinion, this applies no matter if they're deliberative, predecisional, or redactable under any (b)(5) privilege. If the CDC FOIA officers cannot provide a superseding court decision, they will be in violation of law. I am willing at this point to retain legal counsel.\r\n\r\nThis should include all manner of foreign documents previously incorrectly redacted or withheld under (b)(5), including but absolutely not limited to GORAN call notes, slide decks, various reports and drafts of reports, emails that were sent to many other recipients in addition to being to or from the CDC, and anything similar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo my great surprise, several responsive records in the aforementioned FOIA request (and other, similar, requests) appear to have been withheld entirely under (b)(4). GORAN call notes are one such record.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act explains of exemption 4:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The exemption also affords protection to those submitters who are required to furnish commercial or financial information to the government \r\nby safeguarding them from the competitive disadvantages that could result from disclosure.4  The exemption covers two distinct categories of information in federal agency records, (1) trade secrets, and (2) information that is (a) commercial or financial, and (b) obtained from a person, and (c) privileged or confidential\"\r\n\r\n(And)\r\n\r\n\"The D.C. Circuit's decision in Public Citizen represented a distinct departure from what until then had been almost universally accepted by the courts -- that a \"trade secret\" encompasses virtually any information that provides a competitive advantage. In Public Citizen, a \"trade secret\" was more narrowly defined as \"a secret, commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing, compounding, or processing  of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial effort.\"8 This definition also incorporates a requirement that there be a \"direct \r\nrelationship\" between the trade secret and the productive process.9\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI find it highly questionable that the GOARN call notes - about an ongoing disease outbreak - contain entirely \"commercial or financial\" text. I also find it wildly unlikely that the GOARN calls were only ever about the implementation of specific manufacturing techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn light of that knowledge, I am also requesting separately the following documents from the CDC:\r\nAny and all communications between the CDC, or related records between 1, December 2019, and 1 December 2021, involving:\r\n\r\nEmails to or from drtedros@who.int, or any other communications to or from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the WHO. Similarly for the following email addresses and individuals:\r\n\r\n\r\nvankerkhovem@who.int, Maria Van Kerkhove of \r\ngreint@who.int (Dr Thomas Grein)\r\nryanm@who.int (Mike Ryan)\r\nJeremy Farrar - chief scientist at the World Health Organization, may not be using who.int email address in official capacity\r\nsterng@who.int (Gabriellea Stern)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, broadly, any individuals and email addresses associated with the who.int top level domain.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, and separately, any individuals and email addresses of officials associated with the following top level domains:\r\n\r\n.sn\r\n.nl\r\n.uk\r\n.hk\r\ngov.ng\r\n.kr\r\n.ru\r\n.de\r\n.qa\r\n.ca\r\n.gov.cn\r\n.jp\r\n.gov.cr\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER RICCIO",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis is a resubmission of # R000094-061423, which I believe to have been illegally closed due to the extensive mismanagement of mail by the MTA in delaying review of the appeal until after the deadline had passed.\r\n\r\nIt has been more than a year since I submitted the first form of this request, and should the MTA continue to mishandle this process, I will not hesitate to retain legal counsel and begin litigation. I have significantly less patience after the incorrect closure of my appeal, that was downright rude.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am seeking copies of user/driver operating instructions, service manuals, service bulletins, and contract/design specifications, for the following subway cars, by rough order of fleet size:\r\nR46\r\nR62\r\nR62A\r\nR68\r\nR68A\r\nR142\r\nR142A\r\nR143\r\nR160\r\nR188\r\nR179\r\nR211A\r\nAnd the following buses, by rough order of introduction:\r\nNova Bus LFS TL40102A 3rd Generation\r\nOrion Bus Industries Orion VII 07.501 EPA10 3rd Generation\r\nNew Flyer XD40 Xcelsior\r\nNew Flyer C40LF Low Floor\r\nNova Bus LFS-A TL62102A 1st Generation articulated\r\nNew Flyer XD60 Xcelsior articulated\r\nNova Bus.LFS TL40102A 4th Generation\r\nNew Flyer XN40 Xcelsior\r\nNew Flyer XN60 Xcelsior articulated\r\nNew Flyer XDE40 Xcelsior\r\nNova Bus LFS-A TL62102A 4nd Generation articulated\r\nNova Bus LFS TL40102A 4th Generation\r\nNew Flyer XDE40 Xcelsior\r\n\r\nI do *not* need individual service requests, tickets, repair records, or similar information that is unique to each chassis.\r\n\r\nExamples of relevant documents, but by no means the only documents, specifically mentioned as furnished digitally to the MTA from the specification:\r\nTrain Operator's Manual\r\nRoad Car Inspector's Troubleshooting Manual\r\nWork Manual/Inspection Procedures \r\nOverhaul Manuals\r\nMaintenance and Engineering Instruction Manuals  \r\nInstructor Guides\r\nTraining Participant Guides\r\nTraining Aids (videos only)\r\nIllustrated Parts Catalogs (should these be available digitally)\r\n\r\nI do not have any interest in Operator Training Simulators, Special Presentation Equipment/Workstations, Special Tools and Test Equipment Manuals\r\n\r\nYou may narrow the request to only the portions of such records that are related to the HVAC system of vehicles. That's really what I'm interested in. Anything else would've simply been neat.\r\n\r\nSome of these vehicles have been in service for substantially longer than I've been alive. If any potentially responsive records more than 20 years or so old are not easily retrievable or searchable, you may absolutely narrow the search to the past 20 years, or any other reasonable periods of time which might be easily retrievable.\r\n\r\nDo not merely deny the request because the agency is large and may have records stored in different places - work with me. This does not need to be a waste of each other's time, we can go back and forth to construct a narrower request in good faith.\r\n\r\nI believe it is entirely unreasonable to withold, in blanket, the entire category of manuals and service bulletins, let alone the entire request, on the grounds of public safety. The case cited was a case of counterterrorism surveillance in a national security context that may have involved the disclosure of sources, methods, and targets. I think it should be obvious why I do not expect the operating manuals and service bulletins to contain information about sources, methods, and targets, of law enforcement.\r\n\r\nThe idea that mere information of the normal daily workings of mass transit vehicles in public hands is a threat to public safety flies in the face of good security practice (\"security through obscurity\" universally serves to perpetuate embarrassingly poor practices), but also is out of line with other industry practices. As an example, the full crew operations and instruction manuals for every mass produced passenger airliner is freely available to all, on the web, because the aviation industry has a proper understanding of safety and security.\r\n\r\nAs an example of why I believe this is unreasonable in the specific case of transit disruptions, I expect details of the locks and security systems of unattended signal huts to be of greater sensitivity than, for example, the operating instructions for the air-conditioning of a subway car. If these two examples were contained in the same \"record\" I'd reasonably expect the agency to redact the sensitive language rather than refuse disclosure of the entire record.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I have considerable reason to believe that said operation of the HVAC has been in a manner that is harmful to the lives and safety of new yorkers during an airborne pandemic that's already claimed the lives of several tens of thousands of said new yorkers. The disclosure of such information would likely contribute to the increased safety of new yorkers, and reduce disease related disrupts of all sorts in the system\u2026 including disruptions of the sort that have caused numerous sudden staffing shortages for the agency.\r\n\r\nYou cannot reasonably claim information about the HVAC system is an opportunity for terrorists or bad actors. An opportunity for what? To cause death and destruction by making subway cars slightly warmer than the already sizzling summer temperatures? Or cause grievous injuries by... Turning the fans up slightly?\r\n\r\nIf you're *really* honestly concerned that the 10ish buttons and a lever that operate the older model trains are so inherently unsafe and poorly secured that knowing which button (*clearly labeled in the cab*)  is responsible for each function ahead of time is sufficient to endanger the lives of New Yorkers...\r\n\r\nIf you deny the request, then your denial out of concern here indicates a much larger and more embarrassing problem for the MTA: the information that's already in the public domain, including in the form of specifications published by the MTA itself, is far more detailed than is sufficient to do any number of acts of sabotage or worse. \r\n\r\nI am looking right now at a 659 page specifications document published by the MTA that covers more than 200 currently-in-service train cars. It describes everything from the positive detents in the master control (maximum power through emergency brake and shut down), an exact description of the No-Motion Bypass switch, a detailed description (with graphics!) of trainline and car networks, and descriptions of the valves used to disable friction brakes. \r\n\r\nThat is required by law, to enable open bidding on agency contracts - it's an anti-corruption measure that's been in place for generations before me.\r\n\r\nAcross the rest of the internet, there are closeups of the keys used by the MTA to operate equipment like the Master Door Controller and also crew keys and subsequent replacements. I suspect the MDC key is actually the same design as the square key used to open many spigots. Yes, I too had trouble believing the \"the NYCT's standard, square-type, MDC key\" was literally a square key. It seems to be exactly specified in this patent:\r\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US4611104A/en\r\n\r\nIf you still believe there is a security risk involved here, clearly articulate it so that I may adjust the request to avoid a security risk. Anything else is sufficiently vague to deny access to most requests as a form of constructive denial.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue of great, however quiet, controversy where the public declarations of political figures are in great disagreement with the direct measurement of dozens of volunteers on the ground, and it's important to be in possession of the full breadth of circumstances that determine the operation of the system.\r\n\r\nI am open to further narrowing the request if the agency records officers will provide guidance and suggestions as to what they can easily retrieve.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final communication in which my request was improperly closed is included below for your convenience:\r\nRE: FOIL Records Request of June 14, 2023, Reference # R000094-061423.\r\nDear Alexander Riccio,\r\nThe NYS Metropolitan Transit Authority received a FOIL request from you on June 14, 2023. You requested: \"Copies of user/driver operating instructions, service manuals, and service bulletins for all currently in service passenger trains, subway cars, and buses in the system.\"\r\nPlease be advised that your request for \"user/driver operating instructions\" for all currently in service passenger trains, subway cars and buses in the system is denied pursuant to New York Public Officers Law (\u201cNYPOL\u201d) \u00a787(2)(f),  which permits the nondisclosure of information if it would pose a danger to the life or safety of any person. T he records you requested are exempt from FOIL disclosure as they are safety/security sensitive material that can be used to disrupt NYCT operations, threatening the lives and safety of NYCT customers and passengers and the general public. Release of the requested security-sensitive records would pose a security risk in that, public dissemination of the subject records could potentially be exploited by terrorists/bad actors, which could create \u201ca possibility of endangerment.\u201d See Matter of Asian Am. Legal Defense & Educ. Fund v. New York City Police Dept. , 125 A.D.3d 531, 532, 5 N.Y.S. 3d 13, 15, 2015 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 1550, *3, 2015 NY Slip Op 01559, 2.\r\nAdditionally, please be advised that your request for \"service bulletins for all currently in service passenger trains, subway cars, and buses in the system\" is overly broad and vague. Pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a), FOIL requests must be reasonably described so that the agency may locate the records in question. Currently, the description you provided does not allow for practical retrieval by the agency. Specifically, your request fails to provide sufficient information for the agency to identify and locate responsive records, and would require the agency to \"engage in herculean efforts\" to locate records, which we are not required to do (See FOI-AO-18863). You may resubmit your request by providing a narrower timeframe and additional details to narrow down the specific records you are seeking.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to file an appeal regarding this determination, you may do so within thirty (30) days from this correspondence by sending a written appeal to: Chief Safety and Security Officer, Patrick Warren, MTA Headquarters, 2 Broadway, New York, NY 10004.\r\nSincerely,\r\nNYS Metropolitan Transit Authority\r\n\r\nFrom: ALEXANDER RICCIO\r\n\r\n08/24/2023\r\nSubject: RE: New York Freedom of Information Law Request #R000094-061423\r\n\r\nMail\r\nI I'd like to amend my request to narrow it.\r\n\r\nInstead of \"all currently in service passenger trains, subway cars, and buses in the system\", you may only include the following:\r\n\r\nSubway, by rough order of fleet size:\r\nR44\r\nR46\r\nR62\r\nR62A\r\nR68\r\nR68A\r\nR142\r\nR142A\r\nR143\r\nR160\r\nR188\r\nR179\r\nR211A\r\nBuses, by rough order of introduction:\r\nNova Bus LFS TL40102A 3rd Generation\r\nOrion Bus Industries Orion VII 07.501 EPA10 3rd Generation\r\nNew Flyer XD40 Xcelsior\r\nNew Flyer C40LF Low Floor\r\nNova Bus LFS-A TL62102A 1st Generation articulated\r\nNew Flyer XD60 Xcelsior articulated\r\nNova Bus.LFS TL40102A 4th Generation\r\nNew Flyer XN40 Xcelsior\r\nNew Flyer XN60 Xcelsior articulated\r\nNew Flyer XDE40 Xcelsior\r\nNova Bus LFS-A TL62102A 4nd Generation articulated\r\nNova Bus LFS TL40102A 4th Generation\r\nNew Flyer XDE40 Xcelsior\r\n\r\nI do *not* need individual service requests, tickets, repair records, or similar information that is unique to each chassis.\r\n\r\nSome of these vehicles have been in service for substantially longer than I've been alive. If any potentially responsive records more than 20 years or so old are not easily retrievable or searchable, you may absolutely narrow the search to the past 20 years, or any longer periods of time which might be easily retrievable.\r\n\r\nI believe it is entirely unreasonable to withold, in blanket, whole manuals and service bulletins, let alone the entire request, on the grounds of public safety. The case cited was a case of counterterrorism surveillance in a national security context that may have involved the disclosure of sources, methods, and targets. I think it should be obvious why I do not expect the operating manuals and service bulletins to contain information about sources, methods, and targets, of law enforcement.\r\n\r\nAs an example of why I believe this is unreasonable in the specific case of transit disruptions, I expect details of the locks and security systems of unattended signal huts to be of greater sensitivity than, for example, the operating instructions for the air-conditioning of a subway car. If these two examples were contained in the same \"record\" I'd reasonably expect the agency to redact the sensitive language rather than refuse disclosure of the entire record\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I have considerable reason to believe that said operation of the air-conditioning has been in a manner that is harmful to the lives and safety of new yorkers during an airborne pandemic that's already claimed the lives of several tens of thousands of said new yorkers. The disclosure of such information would likely contribute to the increased safety of new yorkers, and reduce disease related disrupts of all sorts in the system\u2026 including disruptions of the sort that have caused numerous sudden staffing shortages for the agency.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous reasons that I request a broader array of records than information about the climate control system only. This is an issue of great, however quiet, controversy where the public declarations of political figures are in great disagreement with the direct measurement of dozens of volunteers on the ground, and it's important to be in possession of the full breadth of circumstances that determine the operation of the system.\r\n\r\nI am open to further narrowing the request if the agency records officers will provide guidance and suggestions as to what they can easily retrieve.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER RICCIO",
