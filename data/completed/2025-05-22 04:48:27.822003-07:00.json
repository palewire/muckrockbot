I also request records of any [2] proposed and/or enacted changes to said policies made on or after Nov. 6, 2024 until date of search, if such documents exist.\"\r\n\r\nRequest #1: Our complete Policies and Procedures are available in the public domain and as such, we are not required to provide them (2 AAC 96.100 (b)). I draw your attention to the following policy numbers:\r\n\r\n  *   202.15: Standards of Conduct\r\n  *   804.01: Special Management Prisoners\r\n  *   806.02: Prisoner Hygiene, Grooming and Sanitation\r\n  *   806.04: Prisoner Uniform\r\n  *   807.02: Access to Health Care Services\r\n  *   807.05: Use of Pharmaceutical Products\r\n  *   807.09: Medical Experimentation\r\n  *   807.23: Treatment and Management of Gender Dysphoria\r\n  *   807.24: Treatment and Management of Female Prisoners\r\n  *   808.09: Prisoner Housing\r\n  *   808.10 Prisoner Marriages\r\n  *   811.04: Search Upon Admission\r\n  *   811.05: Prisoner Property\r\n  *   811.08: Prisoner Orientation\r\n  *   812.10 Prisoner Employment\r\nThe (2022) Alaska DOC Gender Dysphoria Clinical Care Guide is attached.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we use the following resources, available online: National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) Standards for Health Services in Prisons, NCCHC Standards for Health Services in Jails, and NCCHC Standards for Mental Health Services in Correctional Facilities.\r\n\r\nRequest #2: No such records exist.\r\n\r\nBy regulation, this response technically constitutes a partial denial of your records request (because certain records you request do not exist).  For that reason, I am required to provide you the following information. I have been delegated the authority to deny public records requests for the Department of Corrections; you may administratively appeal this denial to the agency head, by complying with the procedures of 2 AAC 96.340.  You may pursue immediate judicial review of this denial by seeking an injunction from the Superior court under AS 40.25.125.  Choosing not to pursue an injunction in Superior court will have no adverse effect on your rights in the administrative appeal.  An administrative appeal from the denial of a request for public records requires no appeal bond.  Copies of 2 AAC 96.335 - 2 AAC 96.350 are enclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\nBetsy\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DBC8A1.D796B670]",

Said file is a letter from Supervisory Government Information Specialist Ruthhee G. Bellamy of the VA OIG Release Information Office - notifying me that VA OIG assigned Tracking Number 23-00006-FOIA to my Request, among other things.  A copy of VHA's 11/17/2022 \"Agency Final Response\" is included in the \"Appendix A\" attachment to this Letter.\r\n\r\nThe \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial\" letter from VA OIG on 11/17/2022 is attached to this Letter as \"Appendix B\"; and declares \"we were unable to locate any responsive records pertaining to your request\"; yet only as the Request pertains to Inspector General Michael J. Missal in VA OIG Records.  Unfortunately, VA OIG's Response to my Request is a false statement of fact; provable by one of many Records in my possession which would have to be included in any satisfactory Response to my Request, notwithstanding whether that Response is from VA OIG, VHA or otherwise applicable officse / divisions of US DVA.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned Record in my possession is an e-mail I sent to Inspector General Missal and others on 05/27/2022 regarding VCOEB, that a simple search for the text \"VCOEB\" will produce upon querying Inspector General Missal's e-mail correspondence between 05/01/2022 and Present.  Given that e-mail was not returned to sender and Inspector General Missal directly corresponded with me several times in the recent past from the same e-mail address; and because information about a Federal Advisory Committee that holds Public Meetings in Open Session on Public land for Public attendance (as Publicly Noticed in the Federal Register), is not qualified to be suppressed due limited National Security provisions under 5 U.S.C. Statutes governing FOIA - apparently the minimum effort to satisfactorily Respond to my Request is beyond some U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Officials' intent to perform...  Despite VA OIG's purported \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial\" Letter probably cost Federal Taxpayer's far more to produce than performing the simple searches to lawfully satisfy and Respond to my Request will; presuming Public Records required to satisfy my Request were not unlawfully tampered with. Even in that hypothetical scenario though, the Records are obtainable from one of many archives US DVA is Mandated to retain as National Security against the tampering or loss of such Records.  A copy of my aforementioned 05/27/2022 e-mail to Inspector General Missal and one of many e-mails Inspector General Missal sent me from the same address he received my 05/27/2020 e-mail at, are attached to this Letter as \"Appendix C\".\r\nNotwithstanding the validity or lack thereof in VA OIG's Response to a portion of my Request through VHA, the partial Response is not a legitimate, full Response to my Request; despite it being uncannily misrepresented as such by false statements of fact.\r\n\r\nThe Agency is at least procedurally failing to Respond to my Request on time in accordance with Federal Public Law.  I reassure you the Requested Records regarding a Federal Advisory Committee with a Public Law Mandate and Charter to improve outcomes for Veterans via Public Meetings held in Open Session here in Our Nation's Capital of Veteran Homelessness - are delays of Public Records offering a direct positive impact on disabled homeless Veterans' probability of survival and General Welfare of U.S. Taxpayers  Contrarily, the ongoing and baseless delays Responding to my Request are negatively impacting disabled homeless Veterans and Federal Taxpayers, until and unless the Request is fully and legitimately Responded to.\r\n\r\nGiven my maintained Good Faith in the majority of Our U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Staff's Public Integrity and capacity to ethically perform their duties in accordance with the Department's true Mission - I expect nothing less than the People of the United States of America do in this matter; a swift, comprehensive, accurate and satisfactory Response to my Request in accordance with Our Rights, Public Laws and increasing expenditures to expect no less of Our U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' performance in respect thereof.\r\n\r\nI declare under under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Thus, we would request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business. You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA. It is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity to determine whether it should be exempt under FOIA, and discuss the consequences of disclosing, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the EOIR is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable.\r\n\r\nIf it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Messages rejected by your email account will not be rerouted to you. \r\nPlease be aware that EOIR is a component of the Department of Justice\u00a0and the custodian of records for the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (ROP), which is the compilation of documents and digital audio recordings produced in proceedings before the immigration courts and the BIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the custodian of records for the \u201cA-file,\u201d which is a series of records of a person\u2019s immigration history and is maintained and stored by DHS. EOIR is not the custodian of records for DHS or its components, nor does EOIR have access to DHS\u2019s A-files. EOIR does not create an ROP until matters are initiated by DHS. Nevertheless, EOIR may create and maintain ROPs for proceedings other than removal proceedings (i.e., credible fear reviews, bond hearings).

Most requests for records of proceedings do not require any fees; however, if the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed $25.00, EOIR will notify you before processing the request to determine whether you will commit to paying the fee or whether you wish to narrow the scope of your request to reduce the fee. Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \r\n\r\nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \r\n\r\nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.\u00a0 Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records.\u00a0 As a matter of default, your request has been placed in track two for simple requests.\u00a0 If you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at EOIR.FOIArequests@usdoj.gov to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request.

You requested, as quoted,\r\n\r\n  *   \"Copies of any and all communications, including emails, email attachments, text messages, voicemails, and memos, held by the Department of Veterans Affairs referencing the Department of Government Efficiency's \"DOGE\" access to agency data systems and records\r\n  *   The list of Department of Government Efficiency \"DOGE\" employees with a \"@va.gov\" email domain.\"\r\n\r\nSearches Dated 2/27/25, 2/28/25, 3/10/25, 3/20/25, 4/9/25, & 4/11/25\r\nOn February 27, 2025, our search cut-off date, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through the VA Integrated Enterprise Workflow Solution (VIEWS), VA's official information system for interagency memoranda, agreement, access requests, contracts.  An OSVA FOIA Officer used the following search terms: DOGE AND (\"information sharing\").  On February 28, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through VIEWS with the following search terms: DOGE AND access.\r\n\r\nOn March 10, 2025, our search cut-off date, an OSVA FOIA Officer requested that the VA Office of Information & Technology (OI&T), Identity and Access Management (IAM) office search for and provide a list of VA information systems that Mr. Justin Fulcher, a Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff and VA Liaison to DOGE, accessed including the last accessed date.  On March 20, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer requested that the VA OI&T IAM office search for the same information for Mr. Cary Volpert, another Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff and VA Liaison to DOGE.\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 2025, and April 7, 2025, the OI&T IAM office provided such list.  None of the information systems accessed are VHA or VBA Privacy Act Systems of Records.\r\n\r\nOn April 9, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through VIEWS for Inter-Agency Agreements, Memoranda of Understanding, Memoranda of Agreement, and Inter-Agency Contracts.  On April 9, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer used the following search terms: \"DOGE\" AND (\"agreement\" OR \"understanding\").\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 2025, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through VIEWS with the following search terms:\r\n\r\n  1.  \"DOGE\" AND \"contract\";\r\n  2.  (\"Government Efficiency\") AND (\"agreement\" OR \"understanding\" OR \"contract\"); and,\r\n  3.  (\"Digital Service\") AND (\"agreement\" OR \"understanding\" OR \"contract\").\r\nOur searches through VIEWS dated February 27, 2025, February 28, 2025, April 9, 2025, and April 11, 2025 yielded no responsive records.\r\n\r\nAll-Other Fee Category\r\nWe have placed you in the all-other category.  For this FOIA request, OSVA does not charge any FOIA fees.  OSVA reserves the right to charge FOIA fees for any future FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nInitial Agency Decision\r\nPlease find attached two (2) pages, which the VA releases in full.  Mr. Fulcher and Mr. Volpert have not accessed any VHA or VBA Privacy Act Systems of Records.\r\n\r\nFOIA Mediation\r\nAs part of the 2007 FOIA amendments, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) was created to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

I, \u00a7 3(b) of the California Constitution.  I seek copies of all records in your office\u2019s possession, regardless of who created them. This request is for all District Attorney\u2019s Office \u201cinvestigative reports,\u201d which you call \u201cmemoranda,\u201d summarizing your office\u2019s investigations and conclusions regarding 165 officer-involved shootings and other use-of-force incidents resulting in serious bodily injury or death occurring in San Bernardino County between 2014-2024 listed in the attached csv. It includes incidents previously identified by your office, which are labeled in the \u201cData From\u201d column as \u201cDA List.\u201d \r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 7922. Pursuant to section 7922.600, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nIf any records requested above are available in electronic format, please provide them in an electronic format, as provided in Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.570. To assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.     \r\n \r\nThank you for your assistance with this routine request.\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nKatey Rusch\r\nReporter, Investigative Reporting Program at UC-Berkeley\r\n(510) 516-6277",

We would like copies of the six public memoranda sent to us by March 28, 2025. As is spelled out in the request, we are requesting to receive records on a rolling basis. As for the remaining review of responsive records, I have a few requests for clarification: \r\n\r\n1) On the remaining 44 names you have reviewed, are you still looking for memoranda on all 44? Or have you determined that responsive memoranda for specific incidents are exempt from disclosure? If you have determined any responsive records are exempt from disclosure, as noted in our request, we expect the legally required determination. \r\n2) On the other 63 cases you have yet to review that are NOT \u201cCurrently Under Review,\u201d when do you plan to make a determination whether or not you have disclosable responsive records? As a reminder, the 10-day determination requirement in Cal Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.535 was Friday 3/14/25 (the request was sent on the evening of 3/3/25 making the date of receipt 3/4/25). \r\n3) On the 52 cases \u201cCurrently Under Review,\u201d we expect the required updates on those responsive records as spelled out in Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 832.7(b)(8). \r\n\r\nAs always, we are happy to answer your questions and look forward to the department's prompt response to this narrowed request. \r\n\r\nBest, \r\n\r\nKatey Rusch\r\n(510) 516-6277\r\nCalifornia Reporting Project\r\n",

I request any and all documents pertaining to Marines support for \"Brothers After War.\" Such documents may include but should not be limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the Marines and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Brothers After War,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation as well as the editor-in-chief and a contributor to a research magazine published by said foundation titled \"Cultural Engineering Studies.\" These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3. The current administration's expansion of federal immigration detention is the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Jaspar Singh, who died in ICE Custody April 15, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrSinghJaspar.pdf. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \r\n\r\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \r\n\r\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \r\n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \r\n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \r\n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \r\n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \r\n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \r\n\r\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25068. Please use this number in future correspondence. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

You have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Jaspar Singh, who died in ICE Custody April 15, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrSinghJaspar.pdf. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nA search of the ICE Offices of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) for records responsive to your request produced 8 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 8 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, Internet Router, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the years 2022-2025.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records include but are not limited to: invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device service providers, device IP addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency the years 2022-2025.\r\n\r\nProvide copies of all records documenting the person responsible for the usage of each device.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, NEXT-REQUEST, or JUST FOIA.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, NEXT-REQUEST, or JUST FOIA.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. Please provide a single fee request for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed contemporaneous exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, Internet Router, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the years 2022-2025.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records include but are not limited to: invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device service providers, device IP addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency the years 2022-2025.\r\n\r\nProvide copies of all records documenting the person responsible for the usage of each device.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE.

This request may be produced in installments.

        "communication": "I am appealing the denial of requested information by the FAA. It appears that the (b)(6) redactions have been made in bad faith, citing concerns for \"harassment.\" Letter from Susan Northrup to FOIA Requester (Jan 2025).\r\n\r\nThe FOIA's Exemption 6 can only be applied when there would be a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" 5 USC 552(b)(6). The FAA has failed to meet the bar to demonstrate that harassment of AAM-300 employees may occur from the disclosure of  names. Indeed, courts have recognized that \"[g]overnment employees, and specifically law enforcement personnel, have a significant privacy interest in their identities, as the release of their identities may subject them to embarrassment and harassment.\" Halpern v. FBI, 181 F.3d 279, 296-97 (2d Cir. 1999). But, the employees of AAM-300 are not \"law enforcement personnel\" nor have a \"significant privacy interest in their identities\" Id. \u201cAn agency must at least explain the ground for concluding that there is some factual basis for concerns about harassment, intimidation, or physical harm.\u201d United America Financial, Inc. v. Potter, 667 F. Supp. 2d 49, 55 (D.D.C. 2009). The FAA has failed to explain any ground for its \"concerns about harassment\" Id. The Supreme Court has agreed that \"[n]ames and other identifying information do not always present a significant threat to an individual's privacy interest.\" Wood v. F.B.I, 432 F.3d 78, 88 (2d Cir. 2005) (see Department of State v. Ray, 502 U.S. 164 (1991)).\r\n\r\nOPM has recognized that release of information about certain employees in specific job categories may \"constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" See The U.S. Office of Personnel Management Data Release Policy August 2020, (Sept. 1, 2020), https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/data-policy-guidance/data-standards/data-release-policy-august-2020.pdf; 5 USC 552(b)(6). The job codes identified by OPM include officers of the Internal Revenue Service and law enforcement personnel. Absent from OPM's guidance are the job categories that FAA has redacted, such as legal instruments examiners. DOT and similar agencies have already released information for those in the same job category, demonstrating there is no cognizable privacy interest for employees of AAM-300. See, e.g., FedsDataCenter, https://www.fedsdatacenter.com/federal-pay-rates/index.php?y=all&n=&l=&a=&o=LEGAL+INSTRUMENTS+EXAMINING. The information sought is already in the public domain, and FAA employees have \"have no privacy interest in information that is already in the public domain.\" Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 840 F. Supp. 2d 226 (D.D.C. 2012).\r\n\r\nThe FAA has failed to reasonably segregate non-exempt material. Specifically, in the case of names of legal instruments examiners who are exercising delegated approval to sign letters for AMCD Manager, the equities weigh in favor of disclosure, as they have a reduced privacy interest due to their exercising of AMCD Manager's authority.  See Sensor Sys. Support, Inc. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 851 F. Supp. 2d 321, 332 (D.N.H. 2012).\r\n\r\nThe decision of the FAA to withhold the requested information should be reversed and remanded.",

(quoting Dep\u2019t of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. at 380 n.19). Here, the FAA's (b)(6) redactions do no better than the Park Police, being \"wholly conclusory, lacking even minimal substantiation\" of AAM-300 employee's \"privacy interest or the potential harm from disclosing their names.\" Id. The D.C.

The relevant section is found on the last page, under \"Assurance of Compliance\". The SPPO requested the documentation be submitted no later than April 30, 2025. If the Kansas Department of Education sent communications to the SPPO requesting an extension or declining to submit the documentation, I request a copy of said communications.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIleana Garnand",
