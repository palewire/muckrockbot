Briefcam audit logs are recorded in a database that can be exported or accessed via API so I ask that you provide it to me as a .csv, .xls, or other database filetype.\r\n\r\n3) Metadata for each real-time and smart alert generated by the department's Briefcam system from 1/1/2024 until the date this request is processed. Briefcam automatically notifies authorized users when connected cameras detect pre-defined events (e.g. a crowd gathering) or profiles (e.g. a vehicle of interest). Please note that I am not requesting the video footage or any personally identifying information associated with the alert, but rather the metadata. Metadata includes, but is not limited to: the type of alert, any rules set for the alert, the date and time of the alert, who received the alert, locations associated with the alert, and algorithmic confidence scores associated with the alert. This metadata is stored in a database so I ask that you provide it to me as a .csv, .xls, or other database filetype.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, please do not hesitate to ask. If you would like to set up a time to discuss this request over the phone, please email me at tfeathers@gizmodo.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you determine certain records or portions of records are exempt from disclosure, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation of the records or portions of records being withheld and the statutory exemptions under which they are being withheld.\r\n\r\nI am requesting these records as a journalist in order to write articles in the public interest about the operations of a government agency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
