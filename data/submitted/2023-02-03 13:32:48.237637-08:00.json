Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where his name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\nAlan Joseph Bellina\r\nAlan Bellina \r\nAlan \u201c100 Proof\u201d Bellina\r\nAlan \u201cProof\u201d Bellina\r\nProof4Truth\r\nTi.positiveproof\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes in the past ten (10) years, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nEven though I was sentenced 13 years ago for a Florida crime unrelated to terrorist activity, I served the sentence and/or punishment imposed on me and cannot continue to be blacklisted or punished for it. Since that prior incident in my life does not meet the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB, I ask that you provide me with all the documents requested herein.)\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n Alan Bellina",

In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\nAlan Joseph Bellina\r\nAlan Bellina \r\nAlan \u201c100 Proof\u201d Bellina\r\nAlan \u201cProof\u201d Bellina\r\nProof4Truth\r\nTi.positiveproof\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes in the past ten (10) years, if the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on a pending alleged investigation, you must certify that (a) the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed and (b) that the \u201congoing investigation\u201d meets the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB.\r\n\r\nEven though I was sentenced 13 years ago for a Florida crime unrelated to terrorist activity, I served the sentence and/or punishment imposed on me and cannot continue to be blacklisted or punished for it. Since that prior incident in my life does not meet the required standard of \u201cparticularized derogatory information and/or a reasonable suspicion\u201d that the undersigned is a \u201ca known or suspected terrorist ('KST')\u201d required to be included in the TSDB, I ask that you provide me with all the documents requested herein.)\r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIn support for my request for expedited processing and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

His death is widely-known and widely reported, and was even the subject of a February 2020 documentary by BBC Persian; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nQotbzadeh immigrated to the United States in 1959, and attended Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service from 1959 to 1963. He participated in student protests against the Iranian government, and stormed a party held by Ardeshir Zadehi, then-Iranian ambassador in Washington. Soviet defector Vladimir Kuzichkin later claimed in his 1991 book, Inside the KGB: Myth and Reality, that Qotbzadeh had been an agent of Soviet military intelligence during this time.\r\n\r\nQotbzadeh became a close aides to the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and participated in the overthrow of the Iranian monarchy and the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He was arrested in April 1982 on charges of plotting a coup d'etat, and was executed in September of that year.\r\n\r\nI previously requested records for Qotbzadeh, request number 1484136-000.\r\n\r\nIn your 29 January 2021 response to that request, you noted that \r\n\r\nAs I wrote in my initial 22 December 2020 request, \"If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\" However, your 29 January 2021 response letter states that you \"consider [the] request fulfilled\" after releasing documents from a previous search. As the letter continues, \"additional records potentially responsive to your subject may exist,\" and I \"may request an additional search for records.\"\r\n\r\nI am requesting that additional search.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. \r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

My request includes but is not limited to\r\n    137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files.\r\n    \r\n    If any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to\r\n    review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of\r\n    responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n    Sincerely,\r\n    \r\n    Matthew Petti\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation **\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress.

        "communication": "Ms. Stevenson,\r\nThis is the response of the Administrative Office of the Courts (\"AOC\") to your request dated February 2, 2023 wherein you requested:\r\n\r\nThe following materials regarding the imposition, assessment, collection and balances of fees and debt for incarcerated youth (i.e., juvenile):\r\n\r\nAll current policies and procedures regarding medical and room & board costs or fees for which incarcerated youth (i.e. juvenile) and/or their parents or legal guardians are or may become liable. Please include all policies and procedures related to how fees are set, accrued, imposed, collected, and enforced (such as those related to per diem fees, ability to pay determinations, penalties for late or non-payment, authorization for civil or criminal action for payment enforcement, etc).\r\n\r\nAll reports, databases, spreadsheets, or equivalent materials regarding debts/restitution paid to or owed to this department/office or any facility/agency under its jurisdiction in FY2021. Please include all relevant data regarding medical and room & board costs, including the number of youths (i.e., juveniles) charged for medical and room & board costs or fees and the total amount of medical and room & board fees imposed in FY2021.\r\n\r\nPursuant to KRS 26A.200, all records which are made by, generated for, or received by an agency of the Kentucky Court of Justice (KCOJ) are the property of the KCOJ and are subject to the control of the Kentucky Supreme Court and are not subject to statutory regulation, including the Kentucky Open Records Act. Ex Parte Farley, 570 S.W.2d 617 (Ky. 1978). Even though court records are not subject to the Kentucky Open Records Act, the KCOJ endeavors to accommodate all requests for records unless the request is overly burdensome or disruptive to court business.\r\n\r\nAccess to AOC administrative records is governed by the Rules of Administrative Procedure Part XVII (\"AP Part XVII\"), adopted by Supreme Court Order 2017-09, which constitutes the Open Records Policy of the Administrative Office of the Courts (\"AOC Open Records Policy\"), attached.\r\n\r\nFor its response, AOC states it does not possess any records responsive to your request.  The Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet, Department of Juvenile Justice is responsible for the care of detained youth in Kentucky and would be the proper custodian for the records you seek.  Information on filing your request with the Department of Juvenile Justice can be found at: Open Records Requests - Department of Juvenile Justice (ky.gov)<https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdjj.ky.gov%2Forr%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx&data=05%7C01%7CDanielleCraig%40kycourts.net%7Caa07ce69e6f24aed5dd308db061dbd2d%7C56e9b0b51da640f9ad00f944fd870af4%7C0%7C0%7C638110497051865097%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=n0%2B159t27NOGX4AvSVJ5iR1ZnnD37j%2FuIqk66H0x2E8%3D&reserved=0>.\r\n\r\nI hope you find this information helpful.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nDanielle M.

        "communication": "Dear Megan:\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting the request below. However, it cannot be processed for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   It is overly broad and fails to reasonably describe the records sought.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   It would require the Office of Science and Technology Policy (henceforth \u201cOSTP\u201d) to create new records or answer questions. Neither of which is permissible under the FOIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   It lacks a date range.\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA regulation states, in pertinent part, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   \u201c[a] request must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable OSTP personnel to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, a requester should include specific information that may assist OSTP personnel in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. In general, a requester should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records sought.\u201d 32 C.F.R.\u00a72402.4(b).\r\n\r\nHere, portions of the request dealing with \u201cworld leaders and American politicians\u201d as well as \u201cthe frequency and overall amount of these requests and the amount of these requests that were deemed to be classified\u201d fail to reasonably describe the records sought or lack specificity. Also, it is unclear what \u201cthese requests\u201d refers to  in the submission.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, references to \u201cfrequency and overall amount\u201d would require us to create new records or answer questions to process the request. The \u201cFOIA imposes no duty on [an] agency to create [new] records,\" Forsham v. Harris, 445 U.S. 169, 186, 100 S. Ct. 977, 63 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1980) (citing NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 161-62, 95 S. Ct. 1504, 44 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1975)), nor to \u201canswer questions disguised as a FOIA request,\" Hudgins v. IRS, 620 F. Supp. 19, 21 (D.D.C. 1985) (citing Di Viaio v. Kelley, 571 F.2d 538, 542 (10th Cir. 1978)), aff'd, 808 F.2d 137, 257 U.S. App. D.C. 242 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\r\n\r\nPlease address the issues above so the request could be processed.\r\n\r\nNOTE: While OSTP  is a component of the Executive Office of the President (henceforth \u201cEOP\u201d), it is not the White House Office (hereafter \u201cWHO\u201d). The WHO is a separate component of the EOP.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you need further assistance.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOSTP FOIA.",
