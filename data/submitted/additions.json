While this visit is discussed in the country of Georgia, there appears to be little to no information about the visit. \r\n\r\nPlease include the following in this request:\r\n\r\nAll photographs or photographic negatives in the agency's possession of Nixon's visit that day. Nixon traveled to polling places and met with Zviad Gamsakhurdia and other prominent Georgians. \r\n\r\nAny correspondence between Richard Nixon and the following CIA officials (Director William Webster, Deputy Richard James Kerr or Robert Gates) where the topic of the correspondence was either the planning for the Tbilisi visit or discussions of impressions or ramifications  of the visit. \r\n\r\nAny collection, translation or interpretations of foreign news media coverage (including but not limited to Georgian and Russian language media) about the political ramifications of Nixon's visit to Georgia on March 31st of 1991. \r\n\r\nAny agency documents which might be understood to be a \"narrative\" of the visit or a written documentation of Nixon's itinerary as recorded by an agency employee or source. \r\n\r\nAny agency documents which might be understood to be a \"narrative\" of the visit or a written documentation of Nixon's itinerary from any source, currently maintained in the agency's records. \r\n\r\nThe FOIA act provides that if portions of a document are exempt from release, the remainder must be segregated and disclosed. Therefore, I will expect you to send all nonexempt portions of the records which I have requested, and ask that you justify any deletions be referencing the specific provisions of the FOI act used to justify the deletions.\r\n\r\nThank you for your commitment to transparency, and I look forward to continue working on this request. This granting of this request would have significant historical value for both the United States and Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
