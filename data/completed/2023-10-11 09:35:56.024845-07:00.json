This should include contracts for CCWIS or comparable systems that include predictive models as well as project descriptions for any models created in-house.\r\n\r\n2) Data dictionaries for all child welfare predictive models used by the department, including those provided by outside entities as well as in-house models. Data dictionaries are  documents commonly created for predictive models and databases. They describe the categories of data that are inputs (age, gender, etc.) and outputs (risk level, etc.) of predictive models. They are equivalent to headers on a spreadsheet, and do not include actual data.\r\n\r\n3) A list of all memorandums of understanding (MOUs) and/or data sharing agreements with state or local agencies for the provision of data that is incorporated into the department's child welfare predictive models. Should the department not maintain a list of these MOUs, I will accept copies of the MOUs themselves.\r\n\r\n4) Any differential impact assessments, validation studies, or comparable documents that describe the accuracy of child welfare predictive models used by the department. This should include any documents that describe common measures of predictive accuracy, such as area under the curve (AUC).\r\n\r\n5) All department policies, employee manuals, and guidelines describing how employees can and/or should use child welfare predictive models. \r\n\r\n6) All governance board, committee, or outside expert reviews assessing the efficacy of the department's proposed or current child welfare predictive models.\r\n\r\nShould you have questions regarding any aspect of this request, please don't hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nI ask that all fees be waived as I am a journalist and intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employ involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed breakdown of the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help, and I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

According to dispatch audio, officers with OPD responded to the scene and pursued a suspect on foot.  At 12:21 (near 1231 51st Ave), they had the suspect in custody.  I am looking for records that indicate the number of officers who responded to this incident, and, if any exist, investigative reports and body camera footage from the officers who responded.  I am also looking for any arrest reports.\r\n\r\nI request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically.\r\n\r\nNews media status and fee waiver:\r\n\r\nAs a reporter for WIRED, I qualify as a news media requester for the purpose of fees. Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees. This request is not primarily in the commercial interest of myself or WIRED. Additionally, please notify me of costs before taking any billable steps.\r\n\r\nSegregability:\r\n\r\nIf you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory exemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to only a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and provide the remainder of the record.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my request, please do not hesitate to e-mail me at dhruv_mehrotra@wired.com. Conde Nast's legal counsel is also copied on this letter. We look forward to a response as quickly as possible under applicable law.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

We received your request on May 10, 2021.  You are\r\nrequesting several FBI files concerning Gavin Hall Macfadyen.\r\n\r\nOur office uses the *FOIAonline* portal for FOIA and Privacy Act requests\r\nfor the National Archives and Records Administration's *operational* records\r\n(records created by this agency). Your *FOIAOnline *request is for records\r\nthat may be *archival* records (records created by or originated in a\r\ndifferent agency but that may have been transferred to the legal custody of\r\nNARA), to which access is restricted. Therefore, we have forwarded it to\r\nour *Office of Research Services, Special Access and FOIA* (RF) staff who\r\nhandle FOIA requests for such archival records.\r\n\r\nSince *Research Services* does not process FOIA requests through\r\n*FOIAOnline*, we removed your request from the *FOIAOnline* website.  *Special\r\nAccess *staff will assign you a new tracking number, and respond directly\r\nto you. In the future, if you need to follow up with that office directly,\r\nplease contact them at the address below, or electronically via email\r\n(email is preferred).\r\n\r\nThe National Archives and Records Administration\r\nSpecial Access and FOIA Staff (RF)\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740\r\n\r\nBy phone: 301-837-3190\r\nBy fax: 301-837-1864\r\nBy email: specialaccess_foia@nara.gov\r\n\r\nFor your reference, a copy of your request is below.\r\n\r\nPlease visit our website at www.archives.gov/foia for further information\r\nabout submitting a FOIA request to NARA.

Your request was received in this office on May 11,\r\n2021 and assigned FOIA tracking number 65692, interim tracking number\r\nRF-737.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to FBI file numbers 100-HQ-440363, 100-WF-41792,\r\n100-HQ-344527, 62-HQ-107350, and/or 100-NY-164641 on Gavin Hall MacFayden.\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Our initial assessment is that Gavin Hall MacFayden is the subject of\r\n   100-NY-164641, compiled as part of a domestic security\r\ninvestigation, created\r\n   between November 1968 and March 1990, and consisting of an estimated 13\r\n   pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Our initial assessment is that the Socialist Youth League is the subject\r\n   of 100-HQ-344527, compiled as part of a domestic security\r\ninvestigation, created\r\n   between March 1941 and September 1973, and consisting of an estimated 9,000\r\n   pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Our initial assessment is that Women Strike Force is the subject of\r\n   62-HQ-107350, compiled as part of an administrative inquiry\r\n   investigation, created between October 1961 and January 1978, and\r\n   consisting of an estimated 16,000 pages\r\n\r\n\r\nThese records require review for information protected from release under the\r\nFOIA <https://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine>:\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe estimated total page count for your request is 25,013 pages. Requests\r\nthat exceed 3,000 pages are assigned to our third-tier processing queue.\r\nYou will receive a response in partial fulfillment of your request after we\r\nhave completed the first increment. We will provide you with an update on\r\nthe status of your request and an estimated completion date at that time.\r\nTo give you an indication of our existing third-tier backlog, we are\r\ncurrently processing requests received in August 2013.\r\n\r\nOnce we notify you that processing is complete, you may either visit our\r\nCollege Park, MD facility to view the file at no cost, or order a\r\nreproduction. Our current fee for reproductions is 80 cents per page, so we\r\nestimate the total cost will be $20,010.40.\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to narrow your request for a potentially faster\r\nprocessing time, please contact us to discuss narrowing options.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to FBI file numbers 100-WF-41792 and 100-HQ-440363 on\r\nGavin Hall MacFayden. Our initial assessment is that Gavin Hall MacFayden\r\nis the subject of the records, compiled as part of a domestic security\r\ninvestigation created between April 1963 and October 1970, and consisting\r\nof an estimated 46 pages.\r\n\r\nThe records were previously requested and reviewed for another requester in\r\nMarch 2017, and information was released to the greatest extent possible.\r\nBelow is a summary of our review:\r\n\r\nRecords Requested\r\n\r\nTotal Pages\r\n\r\nPages Released in Full\r\n\r\nPages Released in Part\r\n\r\nPages Withheld in Full\r\n\r\n100-WF-41792\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n100-HQ-440363\r\n\r\n41\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nWe withheld information protected under section (b) of the FOIA (5 U.S.C.\r\n552).

        "communication": "Dear Jermaine Scott,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response. I agree that narrowing this request would be a good next step to decide about how to proceed for all documents. Thank you for the information. I would like to narrow the request to a subset of the documents mentioned for the case files that I have requested.\r\n\r\nI would like to request a fully copy of 100-NY-164641 (13 pages), and then the first ten pages chronologically of files 100-HQ-344527 (10 pages) and 62-HQ-107350 (10 pages). I believe that this will allow me to make a determination of how to proceed at a later date for 100-HQ-344527 and 62-HQ-107350. Additionally, it should be well below the cap for third tier processing. Would this reduction put my request into a speedy tier or a faster queue? If it is easier to simply narrow to a single locator, I would select 100-NY-164641 and I'm willing to pay for it.\r\n\r\nIf it is also possible to perform a simple release of the already reviewed 100-WF-41792 and 100-HQ-440363 documents, I would like this as well, but only if it does not significantly slow down the response time.  I want to ensure that I receive those full documents from NARA directly.\r\n\r\nI would also like to discuss the possibility of a public interest/journalistic/academic fee waiver or reduction. Gavin was an internationally recognized American journalist working in London, England in the public interest; these documents will help me to inform the public about his life and work. If a fee waiver or fee reduction is not possible, I'm willing to pay immediately for the narrowed files.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to have a telephone call to discuss this narrowing process if that would be useful. Thank you for your time today, I look forward to discussing this request further with you. \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nJacob",

The National\r\nArchives and Records Administration is closed to researcher visits and has\r\nsuspended reproduction and digitization services until further notice due\r\nto COVID-19.

Once operations resume, your reproduction request\r\nwill be serviced in the order it was received.\r\n\r\nYou asked for a waiver of the fees normally charged for providing\r\nresearchers with copies of archival records. The fee and fee waiver\r\nprovisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), however, do not apply\r\nto the archival records. The FOIA fee section states that \u201cNothing in this\r\nsubparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable under a statute specifically\r\nproviding for setting the level of fees for particular types of records\u201d [5\r\nUSC 552 (a) (94 ) (vi)]. Accordingly, the NARA fee statute, 44 USC 2116\r\n(c), and implementing regulations at 36 CFR Part 1258, apply exclusively to\r\nyour request, under which the National Archives does not waive reproduction\r\ncharges for individual requesters. Our inability to grant you the requested\r\nfee waiver does not constitute a denial for the purpose of the FOIA.\r\n\r\nWe are legally bound to charge reproduction fees for our records (more\r\ninformation can be found in our regulations: Title 36: Parks, Forests, and\r\nPublic Property, PART 1258\u2014FEES\r\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=ba12875cd02d4f84c4062c1ea87b9208&h=L&mc=true&r=PART&n=pt36.3.1258\r\n<https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=ba12875cd02d4f84c4062c1ea87b9208&h=L&mc=true&r=PART&n=pt36.3.1258>).\r\nAdditionally, our fee schedule is based on the native format of the\r\nrecords; as these records were originally paper, the reproduction fee is\r\n$.80 per page.\r\n\r\n\r\nJermaine Scott\r\nArchives Specialist\r\nSpecial Access and FOIA Program",

Part of the article is based on the results of this FOIA. Specifically, I declare that \"if the request is made by an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity; or,\"  The information in my request is urgently needed to inform the public about government surveillance activities of American journalists such as Mr. MacFayden who primarily live abroad.  I'm willing to have my editor write a letter confirming these facts, if that is useful.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I also assert that my FOIA relates to another NARA exception: \"when the subject is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\" Requesting Gavin MacFadyen's FBI file resulted in the case numbers at NARA, and since Mr. MacFadyen was subject to government surveillance, this FOIA concerns a matter of the government's integrity, and naturally the results will affect the public confidence in our government. Delaying the result certainly will affect the public confidence in our government.\r\n\r\nAs per NARA's web page on requesting expedited processing, I assert that the above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhat's the next step for receiving expedited processing? According to the website, I will receive a reply within ten calendar days - if there is supplemental information that I can provide sooner, please advise and I will attempt to supply this information in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nJacob",

Your request was received in this office on May 11,\r\n2021 and assigned FOIA interim number RD 65692. You requested access to FBI\r\nfile numbers 100-HQ-440363, 100-WF-41792, 100-HQ-344527, 62-HQ-107350, and\r\n100-NY-164641 on Gavin Hall Macfadyen. In January 2022 you narrowed your\r\nrequest to the first ten pages each of 100-HQ-344527 and 62-HQ-107350, and\r\nthe whole of 100-NY-164641.\r\n\r\nWe completed a line-by-line review of the records you requested. To\r\nminimize reproduction costs to you and avoid reviewing only a partial\r\ndocument, we processed whole serials from 100-HQ-344527 and 62-HQ-107350 up\r\nto a sum of 10 pages; additional serials would take you over the ten-page\r\nthreshold in either instance. We have therefore reviewed serials 1, X1, and\r\nX2 from 100-HQ-344527 for a total of 8 pages, and serials 1-2 from 62-HQ-107350\r\nfor a total of 9 pages. Please contact me directly if you require\r\nadditional pages from either case file.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe completed a line-by-line review of the records you requested. Please be\r\nadvised, we have considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing\r\nrecords and applying FOIA exemptions for this request. Information was\r\nreleased to the greatest extent possible.

Appeals must be in writing and may be delivered by\r\nregular U.S. mail or by email.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

Please clarify if you are seeking records released in response to these requests, or just the communication responding to the request, without the records that were provided in response to the request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis clarification is necessary because, as a school district,  many of our requests are made by parents or legal representatives of students requesting email records that discuss students and students\u2019 education.  Student records are protected under RCW 42.56.230 and the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).  Redacting these records in order to release them to you will take a considerable amount of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same holds true for public record requests made by staff members for records, which would be released largely unredacted to the staff member but would require considerable redactions prior to releasing them to anyone else.  Our Collective Bargaining Agreements also require notification require prior to releasing records that discuss staff, even in a redacted state. We would like to provide the records you are seeking as quickly and efficiently as possible but would like to avoid additional time-intensive work if you are not seeking those records.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our office follows the record retention schedules established by the Washington Secretary of State, we will not be able to provide records dating back to 2010. We will work with our technology staff to retrieve electronic records dating back to June 30, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act, chapter 42.56 RCW, and more specifically RCW 42.56.520 recognizes that additional time to respond to a request is allowed when needed to clarify the intent of the request, to determine if any of the information requested is exempt, to notify third parties affected by the request, or to locate and assemble the information requested.  Given the nature of the request, that is the case here.  The District anticipates being able to release records on or before January 4, 2022.  The sooner you respond to our request for clarification, the sooner we will be able to begin work on your request.  Please let us know if you are no longer seeking records to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org",

Thank you for the clarification email you sent on November 12, 2021.  We have compiled records beginning with the date of your request and working backward to June 30, 2017, which is the extent of the District's email retention date.  Once we have released records to you that do not need additional redactions, we will begin to re-process the records that need additional redactions starting from November 4, 2021 and working backwards to June 30, 2017.\r\n\r\nPlease note, this request will take a substantial amount of time to redact records that were previously released to parents, which contain their students' education records, or staff members' who have requested their own records, etc.  Please let me know if you are only requesting records that do not require additional redactions.\r\n\r\nThe District has compiled the first installment of responsive records to this request.  The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a disc for you.  The charge for the records is $2.00.  The disc may be picked up at the cashier's desk on the second floor of the Administration building - at which time the disc will be release to you.  Or, if you prefer, you may make a check or money order payable to Spokane Public Schools in the amount of $3.70, which includes the cost of the envelope and postage.  Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested disc will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201<https://maps.google.com/?q=200+North+Bernard+Street,+Spokane,+WA+99201&entry=gmail&source=g> Attn: Public Records Office.  Please note the District office will be closed January 17, 2022.\r\n\r\nPlease note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor.  The Legend of Color Coded Redactions will contain the specifics on the redactions in each installment released to the requestors.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before March 4, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org<mailto:CheriS@SpokaneSchools.org>",

Thank you for the clarification email you sent on November 12, 2021.  We have compiled records beginning with the date of your request and working backward to June 30, 2017, which is the extent of the District's email retention date.  Once we have released records to you that do not need additional redactions, we will begin to re-process the records that need additional redactions starting from November 4, 2021 and working backwards to June 30, 2017.\r\n\r\nPlease note, this request will take a substantial amount of time to redact records that were previously released to parents, which contain their students' education records, or staff members' who have requested their own records, etc.  Please let me know if you are only requesting records that do not require additional redactions.\r\n\r\nThe District has compiled the first installment of responsive records to this request.  The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a disc for you.  The charge for mailing the records to you is $1.70. Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested disc will be mailed to you.

If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor.  The Legend of Color Coded Redactions will contain the specifics on the redactions in each installment released to the requestors.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before June 3, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org",

For example, records which were previously provided to parents or employees that contain exempt information would need additional review and redaction prior to releasing these records to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease clarify within 30 days whether you are, in fact, seeking those records which will require additional review and redaction. If we do not receive clarification from you within 30 days, we will assume you are not seeking those records which require additional redaction.\r\n\r\nThe District has compiled another installment of responsive records to this request.  The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a thumb drive for you. If you would like the records, the cost is $7.21 to include the cost of the thumb drive, envelope and postage.  Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested records will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201<https://maps.google.com/?q=200+North+Bernard+Street,+Spokane,+WA+99201&entry=gmail&source=g> Attn: Public Records Office.\r\n\r\nPlease note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor.  The Legend of Color Coded Redactions will contain the specifics on the redactions in each installment released to the requestors.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before December 22, 2022. Please let me know if you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org<mailto:CheriS@SpokaneSchools.org>",

The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a thumb drive for you. No redactions have been applied, so a withholding index is not included.\r\n\r\nIf you would like the records, the cost is $7.45 to include the cost of the thumb drive, envelope and postage. Once payment has been received, the thumb drive will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201, Attn: Public Records Office.\r\n\r\nPlease also note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before July 14, 2023, due to the records needing additional review, redactions and/or third party notification prior to releasing the records to your organization. Please let us know if you are no longer seeking records responsive to this request.\nSincerely,\r\nTerri\r\n\r\nTerri LeFors\r\nExecutive Assistant\r\nBusiness Services\r\n(509) 354-7395\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D9955D.BD604380]",

We now understand why our past installments were being sent back to us \"return to sender\".  In the future, please direct any communications regarding your request either directly to me, or to District representative Terri LeFors.  I have included Terri on this communication to ensure you have her email address moving forward.  If you do feel the need to continue to send communications regarding your public records request via U.S. Mail, please ensure that any mailings contain language directing the email directly to Terri (i.e., \"attn: Terri LeFors\") rather than the District in general.\r\n\r\nYour past communication went to the District's billing department, who does not handle the processing of public records requests.  Thus, any communications you send to the District in general (or to the billing department specifically) may not be received by the District's public records department.  In the meantime, we will resend your previous installments to you at your newly-provided address.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, we believe it may take us a few more days than originally anticipated to provide you with the next installment.

Adri\u00e1n Lamo, or \"The Homeless Hacker\" (Born February 20, 1981 \u2013 Died March 14, 2018). Adrian Lamo was born in Malden, Massachusetts on February 20, 1981 \r\n and has been reported deceased in Wichita, Kansas on March 14, 2018. Major media outlets across America as of March 14, 2018 have reported his death including The Wichita Eagle: http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article205629184.html and follow up article https://www.kansas.com/latest-news/article210989594.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS),  Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Adrian Lamo.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that Mr. Adrian Lamo's DNA is on file in the CODIS database, as well as his fingerprints in the IAFIS database, are held by the FBI due to the very public court battle on the matter as published by Wired in 2007: https://www.wired.com/2007/06/hacker-adrian-l/\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Adrian Lamo.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Adrian Lamo.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Adrian Lamo including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nMr.  Adrian Lamo was a controversial public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJacob Appelbaum\n\n",

I've review a portion of the records that the agency located in response to your request, and I was hoping we could schedule a quick phone call this week to discuss your appeal. I have a general sense of the email records that we have that mention The Hacking Team, and I'd be happy to describe what I've reviewed so far and hopefully determine which of these records would be useful to you and which would not. That way I could provide you with a smaller quantity of potentially useful records in a shorter period of time.\r\n\r\nI should be free any time Wednesday morning, Thursday, or Friday.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSteve Giballa\r\nSenior Counsel, Cyber Law\r\nUnited States Secret Service\r\n202-507-1494\r\n\r\nAll e-mail to/from this account is subject to official review and is for official use only.

        "communication": "Hi Emma,\r\n\r\nNo problem  - I can describe at least the primary question that will help define the set of records that you\u2019re requesting. Our CIO\u2019s search of USSS email records turned up a bit over 30,000 emails that included the phrase \u201cHacking Team.\u201d From the couple thousand I\u2019ve reviewed so far, most of these are emails from the Hacking Team that appear to have been distributed to a kind of list-serve. Each email is typically a link to a news story about either cybercrime or just a foreign policy/national security story, with some editorializing from David Vincenzetti. We have multiple copies of each of these emails, which appear to have been sent to the list on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nSo I think the initial question is are you interested in receiving copies of these emails from the Hacking Team? Or would you rather only receive records of emails generated within the USSS that are in some way about the Hacking Team? That second category is going to be much smaller.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m happy to answer any follow-up questions about this as well. Hope the recovery is going well.\n-Steve",

More specifically, I request contracts and other legal documents that are in effect during the time frame specified,\u201d please be advised the link below will provide you with access to the current active contracts and purchase orders the City has with AdventHealth. Additionally, the link contains access to the readily available active legal documents the City has with AdventHealth.\r\nPlease be advised, access to this link will expire on Thursday, August 31, 2023 12:00 AM. It is suggested that you download and save the files contained in this link as once the link expires they will no longer be accessible and any requests for access to these files will be treated as a new request which will result in a further delay in obtaining your requested information.\r\nhttps://ftp.altamonte.org/?ShareToken=B318F9DC2AF292BDD813D11D868E9C37F6EF1C2E\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the remaining legal documents would require extensive research in order to provide. Therefore, as a follow-up to and regarding your Public Records Request, and with consideration of the extensive work required to provide you with the records you have requested, right now, City Staff has estimated it would take approximately 4 hours of staff time to provide you with each of the applicable documents/files that you have recently requested.

Please provide payment to:\r\n\r\nCity of Altamonte Springs\r\nOffice of the City Clerk\r\n225 Newburyport Avenue\r\nAltamonte Springs, FL 32701\r\n\r\nOr, use the attached instructions to make your payment online. Please notify us once payment has been made.

The NPRC will assign your request a\r\ntracking number and respond directly to you.  In the future, if you need to\r\ncontact the NPRC, you can do so by mail or fax to the following address:\r\n\r\nNational Personnel Records Center\r\n1 Archives Drive\r\nSt. Louis, Missouri 63138\r\n\r\nTelephone:   314-801-0800\r\nTelephone (Toll Free):  1-866-272-6272 (only within the US)\r\nFax:  314-801-9195\r\n\r\nFor your reference, below you will find your original submission.\r\n\r\nOn our website at https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records\r\nyou can find information about requesting Official Military Personnel Files\r\n(OMPFs) that are not yet archival records fully open to the public.  At the\r\nwebsite for the National Archives at St. Louis,\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/st-louis/ <https://www.archives.gov/st-louis/%20>,\r\nyou will find information about requesting Official Military Personnel\r\nFiles that are now archival records open to the public.
