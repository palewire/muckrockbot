        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny record created between October 1, 2021, and December 19, 2022, in which DHA communicated to Congressional appropriators a need to increase the agency\u2019s FOIA budget. \r\n\r\nResponsive records include any emails and attachments relating to the DHS\u2019s Congressional Budget Justification for the ICE Mission Support - M&A, Ops Support PPA accounts associated with DHS-ICE\u2019s proposed funding. \r\n\r\nThey would also include any briefing materials and budgets submitted to the House Appropriations - Homeland Subcommittee, or to the Senate Appropriations Committee, or to the team of Senators who negotiated the Omnibus FY23 spending bill. \r\n\r\nLikely Custodians of Record:\r\n1. DHS Office of Legislative Affairs\r\n2. DHS Chief Financial Officer\r\n3. DHS General Counsel \r\n4. DHS FOIA/PA Office \r\n5. DHS Secretary\r\n\r\nPlease search any materials DHS submitted to the legislative POCs above, even if DHS did not submit these materials itself, allowing ICE to do so. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Requested\r\nWe hereby request expedited processing of this request and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746:\r\n\r\nICE\u2019s Lynnea Schurkamp has declared under oath in Innovation Law Lab v ICE (DNM) and Owen v ICe (CD Cal) that the agency\u2019s FOIA Office currently lacks the resources to comply with statutory timing requirements, including the expedited processing provisions of FOIA, and the 20/30-day determination provisions. Elsewhere in FOIA litigation, ICE has admitted under oath to a policy of destroying data on employee cell phones when those phones are decommissioned, in apparent violation of the Federal Records Act and FOIA.  \r\n\r\nOur project currently has more than 100 FOIA requests pending with DHS FOIA component entities. The vast majority of these requests are overdue, and in many cases, far outside even the extensive, 340+-day backlog the agency has self-reported. \r\n\r\nDHS components have taken the position in litigation that the obstacle to compliance with the timing requirements of the FOIA is funding. Yet in the most recent Omnibus text, there is not a single mention of the funding gaps DHS components say prevent it from discharging its obligations under FOIA. See:  https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Division%20F%20-%20Homeland%20Statement%20FY23.pdf\r\n\r\nThere is, similarly, no mention of this emergency shortfall of funding in the FY22 budget, either. https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/DHSRept_FINAL.PDF\r\n\r\nThus, as far as we can tell from the public record, DHS entities have claimed, in court, under oath, that it cannot obey FOIA\u2019s timing requirements under current funding levels and then, apparently, refused to seek additional funding. The records sought in this request will either confirm or disprove this state of affairs. \r\n\r\nFailing to provide these records in a timely manner will deprive Al Otro Lado\u2019s #DetentionKills project of the substantial due process rights enshrined in 5 USC 552 and 6 CFR 5.5(e) to know what the agency is up to and have regular processing within statutory timeframes\u2014particularly of expedited processing requests. \r\n\r\nIN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PLAIN TEXT OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, PLEASE: \r\n\r\n1. ACKNOWLEDGE this expedited processing request within TEN CALENDAR DAYS \r\n2. ASSIGN this request an individualized tracking number. \r\n3. DETERMINE whether to grant expedited processing to this request. \r\n4. NOTIFY us in writing of this determination. \r\n5. PROVIDE an estimated date on which records will be released. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) records, documents, and communications responsive to Operation Hermit. Operation Hermit was a black propaganda campaign conducted by the OSS in Nanking, China between roughly June and September 1945, and was led by OSS officer Seymour I. Nadler. The program was first identified publicly by one of its participants, Elizabeth MacDonald (aka Elizabeth McIntosh), in her 1947 book \"Undercover Girl\". Ms. MacDonald describes the program as radio broadcasts providing a \"daily forecast based on the pseudo-sciences of astrology, fortune telling, face reading, palmistry, phrenology, and numerology\" (pages 200-201). Mr. Nadler confirmed his participation as part of an interview in 1989 for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Project Information Series, where he references Ms. MacDonald's \"Undercover Girl\" by name. A third participant, Gordon Auchincloss, confirmed his role in an American Public Media radio documentary, \"Battles of Belief in World War II\".\r\n\r\nMr. Nadler's statement can be found on page 2 of the linked PDF: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/mss/mfdip/2004/2004nad01/2004nad01.pdf\r\n\r\nMr. Auchincloss's statements can be found in the linked transcript: https://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/wwii/transcript.html\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of privacy. All of the subjects have disclosed their participation in Operation Hermit and spoken of their roles publicly, as shown above. Additionally, there is no expectation that this request will interfere with any ongoing operations, nor should it reveal any trade secrets. Operation Hermit occurred 77 years ago, and the OSS ceased all operations shortly thereafter. \r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Creem Magazine, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

We received your request on December 22, 2022.  Your\r\nrequest concerns United States Naval Records.\r\n\r\nOur office handles FOIA and Privacy Act requests for NARA\u2019s operational records\r\n(records created by this agency).   Because your FOIA request is for\r\nrecords that may be archival records (records created by or originated in a\r\ndifferent agency but that may have been transferred to the legal custody of\r\nNARA), we are forwarding it by this email to our Office of Research\r\nServices, Textual Reference (RR2RR) staff who handle FOIA requests for\r\ntextual archival records.\r\n\r\nThat office will assign your request a tracking number and respond directly\r\nto you. In the future, if you need to follow up with that office directly,\r\nplease contact them at the address below, or electronically via email\r\n(email is preferred).\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\nResearch Services, Textual Reference Branch (RR2RR)\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 2400\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740\r\n\r\nPhone: 301-837-3091\r\nFax: 301-837-1752\r\nEmail: archives2reference@nara.gov\r\n\r\nFor your reference, a copy of your request is below.\r\n\r\nPlease visit our website at www.archives.gov/foia for further information\r\nabout making a FOIA request to NARA.  On our main website,\r\nwww.archives.gov, you\r\ncan learn more about the resources we offer to the public, and you can\r\naccess our online catalog.\r\n\r\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, and pursuant to guidance received from the\r\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB), NARA had adjusted its normal\r\noperations to balance the need of completing its mission-critical work\r\nwhile also adhering to the recommended social distancing for the safety of\r\nour staff. As a result of this re-prioritization of activities, you may\r\nexperience a delay in receiving a substantive response to your FOIA\r\nrequest.  We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your\r\nunderstanding and patience.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJodi L.
