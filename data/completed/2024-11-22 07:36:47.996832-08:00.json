If a narrower time is needed, please let me know. I don't believe records will be voluminous in either case. I am looking for one particular report originating at the Dane County Regional Airport.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohn Public",

So I would say they likely have a communication teams and/or scheduler that manages that. I ask that you search their communications teams, likely the Office Of Communication under Heather Bair-Brake or the Director of Communications staff (under Michelle Bonds) for records. \r\n\r\nSecond, I am looking for records related to any attempted scheduling of appearances on CNN by their communication teams. I am also looking for records of any cancellations as well. I would recommend searching for emails with the following keywords: \"CNN\", \"booked\", \"appearance\", \"rescheduled\", \"cancelled\", or \"on hold\". \r\n\r\nAgain, we believe that should be enough to properly narrow the scope of the request. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nFreddy Martinez",

This record(s) is not otherwise available. Our department needs additional time to prepare the records for release. Extension for release is necessary because the requested records require additional steps before it can be made available for public release. As the requested record was created during the course of police business, it is expected to contain a mixture of exempt and non-exempt information. The exempt information is likely of a personal nature of the involved person(s) or CJIS-protected information, which is prohibited from release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo go further into detail which is specific to the process of researching, locating and redacting body/dash camera video requests. Currently, our unit only has four members who are solely responsible for the entire department's open records requests where body/dash camera video are being requested. (As well as any audio/video which are included in case file requests). For each request we are assigned we must conduct a search by officer and date.\u00a0If video is located, we must determine whether an investigation/court case related to the incident is open. We then must download each video, one at a time, and then watch and manually redact any exempted information. We do this to protect the privacy of our citizens as well for CJIS security requirements. Unfortunately, only one item/image/sound may be redacted at a time; if there are multiple exempt items, they must be redacted individually. There is no automatic process to redact exempt items. For every minute of video it is estimated it takes 7 minutes of \u201credaction/review\u201d.\u00a0Some requests take as little as 30 minutes to an hour to complete, while some can take over a week. And often one request doesn't equal one video. Some requests can have two, five, ten, etc.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor all the reasons stated above, pursuant to KRS 61.872(5), the non-exempt responsive records will be made available on or before March 11th, 2025.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo remain fair and unbiased to requestors, we process in the order they are received. Our unit currently has an estimated 1,000+ pending requests for video. We are working as diligently as possible given the resources and personnel allotted to our unit. If we get to your request ahead of the quoted date, it will be provided earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo may be provided faster via subpoena if applicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at Louisville Metro Government.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Specifically, we seek emails sent or received, calendar entries for appointments to discuss either of the deaths in custody, Teams messages, the contents of SharePoint drive folders regarding ICE's public statements regarding these deaths, and any records relied upon to assert the factual matters in ICE's post-death release statements, posted here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/brazilian-man-ice-custody-passes-away-new-mexico-hospital?s=09\r\nand here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/nicaraguan-man-ice-custody-passes-away-colorado-hospital\r\n\r\nBy definition, the information requested cannot be subject to withholding under Exemption 7A (open investigations), because ICE has already released its core facts publicly.\r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\n1. Both the Torrance in-custody death and the Aurora in-custody death have been met with calls from elected Representatives and Senators for vigorous investigation, based on each facility's documented track record. See https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/heinrich-leads-request-for-immediate-action-from-ice-to-address-inhumane-unsafe-conditions-for-migrants-at-the-torrance-county-detention-facility and https://crow.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/crow.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2022.10.21-final-icedhs-letter_0.pdf. \r\n\r\n2.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

You had appealed an adverse determination of your request dated 1/23/2024. \r\n\r\nWe have considered your request under the both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  After review of the documents, I have determined that portions of documents will be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6 of the Privacy Act and Exemptions 7 of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 5 protects from disclosure those inter- or intra-agency documents that are normally privileged in the civil discovery context.  The three most frequently invoked privileges are the deliberative process privilege, the attorney work-product privilege, and the attorney-client privilege.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, I have determined that portions of the responsive documents qualify for protection under the deliberative process privilege/ attorney work-product privilege/ attorney-client privilege/ or all three.  The deliberative process privilege protects the integrity of the deliberative or decision-making processes within the agency by exempting from mandatory disclosure opinions, conclusions, and recommendations included within inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters.  The release of this internal information would discourage the expression of candid opinions and inhibit the free and frank exchange of information among agency personnel. The attorney work-product privilege protects documents and other memoranda prepared by an attorney in contemplation of litigation. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may consist of social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are considered personal.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nExemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I determined that disclosure of law enforcement systems checks could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist",

You requested: \"1)The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter, 2) The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. 3) The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter and 4) The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\" We assigned your request FOIA tracking number FCA-25-007.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that searches are complete for FCA-25-007 and records have been located. Attached please find 3 emails responsive to your request. I have determined that all 3 emails are appropriate for release without excision. In response to your inquiry regarding full-time equivalent count of people who work for FCA's FOIA office, FCA has approximately 0.30 overall total number of \"Full-Time FOIA Staff.\"\r\n\r\nThere are no fees associated with your request.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA Public Liaison is responsible for increasing transparency, understanding the status of requests, and resolving disputes between you and FCA. If you need assistance in any of these matters, please send an email to the FCA's FOIA Public Liaison at FOIAPublicLiaison@fca.gov<mailto:FOIAPublicLiaison@fca.gov>.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with my response to this request, you may administratively appeal the determination within 90 days from the date of this letter. If you decide to appeal, your appeal should include a copy of your original FOIA request, a copy of this response letter, as well as a summary of the reasons supporting the appeal. The envelope should be clearly marked to indicate that it contains a \"FOIA Appeal\" and be addressed to: Director, Office of Agency Services, Farm Credit Administration, 1501 Farm Credit Drive, McLean, VA 22102-5090 or you may also submit your appeal via email to FOIAappeal@fca.gov<mailto:FOIAappeal@fca.gov>. Please note, appeals must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of the response to your request.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS, College Park, Maryland, 20740-6001; email at ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>; telephone at 202.741.5770; toll free at 1.877.684.6448; or facsimile at 202.741.5769.\r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of FOIA. See 5 U.C.S. \u00a7 552(c) (2006 & Supp. IV (2010)). This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.\r\n\r\nIf you need further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please do not hesitate to contact me at FCA_FOIAOfficer@fca.gov<mailto:FCA_FOIAOfficer@fca.gov>.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJacqueline Baker\r\nFOIA Officer\r\nFarm Credit Administration\r\n1501 Farm Credit Drive\r\nMcLean, VA 22102\r\noffice: (703) 883-4148",

As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 360 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

According to your request description, you are seeking expenditures for any provision of disaster supplies to individuals and households, including but not limited to bottled water, lighting supplies, and food products for the years 2000-2024. These may be recorded as annual totals, provisioned by Disaster Number, or unaggregated. Expenditures may include direct provision, contracted provision, or provision via another entity such as contribution to an interagency effort. Your request has been assigned the following tracking number 2024-FEFO-01570. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request.  Consistent with the DHS FOIA Regulations 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.5(a), FEMA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.  Although FEMA\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances.  As your request seeks documents that will require a thorough and wide-ranging search, FEMA will invoke a 10-day extension for your request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(a)(6)(B).  If you would like to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office.  We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nCould you please specify whether you are looking for information on specific disasters or states to help us conduct a more targeted search? If so, please provide the disaster numbers or states. If this is not the case, please confirm by October 1, 2024. If we do not hear from you by this date, we will process your request with the understanding that you did not provide us with clarification. \r\nWe may contact you again about more information about your FOIA request. You have been placed in the fee requester category \u201cAll Other\u201d requester, pursuant to the DHS FOIA Regulations, 6 CFR \u00a75.11. \r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations as they apply to \"All Other\" non-commercial requesters for the information that is not considered your Privacy Act information.  As a non-commercial requester of this type of information, you may be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00.  This office will contact you before accruing any further fees. \r\n\r\nWe will query the appropriate offices within FEMA who may have the records you are seeking to determine if fees will apply. Then we will contact you again once our calculations are completed and notify you before proceeding further with the processing of your FOIA request. \r\n\r\nIn the event that you are charged fees, we invite you to reach out to our Office to discuss how to narrow your request and reduce the fees assessed. We appreciate your patience. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or would like to discuss this matter, please contact the assigned FOIA specialist directly at, jennifer.chavez@fema.dhs.gov and reference the request number 2024-FEFO-01570.  Again, If you require additional support, you may also contact FEMA\u2019s Public Liaison at FEMA-FOIA@fema.dhs.gov.  If you need to contact FEMA\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, then please reference the FOIA request number and address your email to \u201cAttn: FEMA\u2019s Public Liaison\u201d and summarize your concerns. \r\n\r\nYou may also contact FEMA at (202) 646-3323, or you may contact FEMA\u2019s Public Liaison in the same manner.  Please reference FOIA request number 2024-FEFO-01570. \r\n\r\nFor a faster response please communicate by email. \r\n\r\nThank you for your interest in FEMA. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nDisclosure Branch \r\nInformation Management Division \r\nOffice of the Chief Administrative Officer \r\nFederal Emergency Management Agency \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security",

I hope to provide some options to help narrow the search in order to reduce search costs, fees, and increase the chance that we can access records soon. I hope to use the information provided in this request by December 1. To that end, I am wondering if you could provide an estimate of fees and search times for the three sets of disasters listed in the attached spreadsheet. The largest set of disasters is in Sheet 1, corresponding to all disasters of a specified set of incident types for 2006-2018 (710 disasters). Sheet 2 restricts to such disasters occurring in 2017 only (56 disasters), and Sheet 3 restricts to such disasters occurring in Florida only (22 disasters).  I hope that this can help streamline the process of determining a search restriction that suitably reduces search costs and search timeline on both ends. Please let me know if this will work.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJohanna Rayl ",
