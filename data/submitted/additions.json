(You may find the post at https://twitter.com/geoffrey_cain/status/1711482592078258274, an archived version at https://web.archive.org/web/20231010034835/https://twitter.com/geoffrey_cain/status/1711482592078258274 and a screenshot attached below.) I am seeking copies of the messages Cain claims to have sent to his FBI contacts, if they exist.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires. If emails are among the responsive documents, please include any files attached to those emails as well.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an investigative journalist who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the BBC, The Intercept, The Daily Beast, The Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, and Reason Magazine \u2014 among other publications \u2014 and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",
