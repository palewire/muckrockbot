This includes A) any notes taken during meetings that discussed IVAS at Camp Santiago and B) any other documents related to IVAS, including internal documentation, public relations materials, after action reviews, and executive summaries.\r\n\r\n2) Any messages, communications, emails, and associated attachments shared with local, state, and federal agencies to promote \"situational awareness\" of IVAS training at Camp Santiago. These emails, messages, and associated attachments can include but are not limited to A) communications  inviting local, state, and federal agencies to participate in training exercises and B) communications letting local, state, and federal agencies know about activities taking place during the military training.\r\n\r\n3) Any internal or external organizational charts created during the lead up to the IVAS tropics test showing the command structure to be followed during the military training exercise. \r\n\r\n4) Any attendance sheets produced during the course of the IVAS tropics test at Camp Santiago.\r\n\r\n5) Any maps created during the course of the IVAS tropics test at Camp Santiago.\r\n\r\n6) Any recordings, videos, and/or images produced during the course of the IVAS tropics test at Camp Santiago.

You can treat #7 (emails) as a separate request because I suspect there will be many more responsive documents there.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. It will be used in the course of reporting for Marea Ecologista, an independent journalism outlet.
