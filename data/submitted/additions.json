The requested documents will contribute to public understanding of the charge and the way they are issued.\r\nFor records originating or only existing in digital form, I respectfully request these records be provided in their native electronic formats that preserve all metadata. Specifically:\r\nBody\u2011cam and footage: original video files\r\nEmails: .eml or .msg\r\nDocuments: .docx, .xlsx, .pdf (searchable)\r\n\r\nPlease deliver these electronic records to the email address listed below. If file size limitations prevent email delivery, I am willing to accept records via a secure file transfer method of your choosing or provide a storage device, if necessary.\r\n\r\nIf the documents I have requested are not disclosable in their entirety, I request that you release all nonexempt portions of the documents after separating them from the portions you deem exempt. With respect to documents or portions of documents that are exempt, please state with particularity the specific legal and factual basis justifying each exemption, as well as the nature of information being withheld. See MCL 15.235(5)(a)-(c); MCL 15.244. This includes identifying those records that are being withheld in their entirety.

If you do not grant this fee waiver, please contact me before processing if the total cost will exceed $500.00.\r\n\r\nPlease note that willful failure to comply with a FOIA request is grounds for civil fines, and legal fees and costs may be awarded to a plaintiff who prevails in a FOIA case, especially where the public body has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying the FOIA request. See MCL 15.240(6).\r\n\r\nI appreciate your assistance in processing this request in a timely manner as required by law. If you need any clarification or have any questions about this request, please contact me immediately at coriosterman@nowkalamazoo.org.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The requested documents will contribute to public understanding of the charge and the way they are issued.\r\nFor records originating or only existing in digital form, I respectfully request these records be provided in their native electronic formats that preserve all metadata. Specifically:\r\nBody\u2011cam and footage: original video files\r\nEmails: .eml or .msg\r\nDocuments: .docx, .xlsx, .pdf (searchable)\r\n\r\nPlease deliver these electronic records to the email address listed below. If file size limitations prevent email delivery, I am willing to accept records via a secure file transfer method of your choosing or provide a storage device, if necessary.\r\n\r\nIf the documents I have requested are not disclosable in their entirety, I request that you release all nonexempt portions of the documents after separating them from the portions you deem exempt. With respect to documents or portions of documents that are exempt, please state with particularity the specific legal and factual basis justifying each exemption, as well as the nature of information being withheld. See MCL 15.235(5)(a)-(c); MCL 15.244. This includes identifying those records that are being withheld in their entirety.

If you do not grant this fee waiver, please contact me before processing if the total cost will exceed $500.00.\r\n\r\nPlease note that willful failure to comply with a FOIA request is grounds for civil fines, and legal fees and costs may be awarded to a plaintiff who prevails in a FOIA case, especially where the public body has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying the FOIA request. See MCL 15.240(6).\r\n\r\nI appreciate your assistance in processing this request in a timely manner as required by law. If you need any clarification or have any questions about this request, please contact me immediately at coriosterman@nowkalamazoo.org.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
