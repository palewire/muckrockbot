Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action. \r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force. \r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes: \r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm]. \r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action.\r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force.\r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes:\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm].\r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication.\r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Your request was received by the Department of Technology, Management and Budget, Central Procurement Services, on March 8, 2024.  You have requested:\r\n\r\nI am seeking any agreements, documents, reports, communications, lists, logs or datasets showing the names of the state and local law enforcement agencies that have bought or can use services through the following Personal Information Database contracts: LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Contract #: 200000000664 and West Publishing Corporation, a Thomson Reuters business, Contract #: 200000000689.\r\n\r\nThe following action has been taken in response to this request:\r\n\r\nREQUEST GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST PARTIALLY GRANTED:\r\n\r\nWe have identified records believed to be responsive to your request. Your request is granted as to existing, non-exempt records which are within the possession of the DTMB, and which fall within the scope of your request.  The requested records are attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4(5) of the FOIA, MCL 15.234(5), provides that a public body must notify the requester in writing if all or a part of the requested information is available on the public body's website.  Please be informed that all or parts of the records you have requested are available without charge at: State of Michigan, DTMB contracts may be available free of charge at: DTMB - Contract List (michigan.gov)<https://www.michigan.gov/dtmb/procurement/contractconnect/contract-list>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST PARTIALLY DENIED:\r\n\r\n\r\nMCL 15.232(e), Records Not Possessed by DTMB\r\n\r\nTo the best of the Department's knowledge, information, and belief, DTMB does not maintain or possess public records as that term is defined under section 2(e) of the FOIA, MCL 15.232(e), under the name given in your request or by another name reasonably known to the Department, to wit, agreements, documents, reports, communications, lists, logs or datasets showing the names of the local law enforcement agencies that have bought or can use services through the following Personal Information Database contracts: LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Contract #: 200000000664 and West Publishing Corporation, a Thomson Reuters business, Contract #: 200000000689\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMCL 15.233(3)(1) Request Overly Broad\r\n\r\nMCL 15.233, Sec. 3 (1) provides that a requesting person must describe a public record sufficiently to enable the public body to find the record.  Regarding any agreements, documents, reports, communications, lists, logs or datasets, this part of your request does not describe records sufficiently to enable the department to determine what records you are seeking. It is hereby certified that, to the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief, records do not exist within the department under the description you provided or under another name reasonably known to the department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMCL 15.233(3)(4) Compile or Create a New Record\r\n\r\nMCL 15.233, Sec. 3 (4) provides that a public body is not required \"to make a compilation, summary, or report of information...\" in response to a request.  You have not described existing public records within this department pursuant to section 3(1) of the FOIA. Therefore, your request is denied pursuant to section 3(4) and (5) of the FOIA, to wit, agreements, documents, reports, communications, lists, logs or datasets specific to law enforcement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department's written procedures and guidelines and a summary thereof can be viewed at: www.michigan.gov/foia-dtmb<http://www.michigan.gov/foia-dtmb> .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the denial determination, pursuant to section 10 of the FOIA, you may do either of the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.            Appeal this decision in writing to the DTMB Director Michelle Lange, Elliott-Larsen Building, 320 South Walnut, P.O. Box 30026, Lansing, Michigan 48909.  The writing must specifically state the word \"appeal\" and must identify the reasons you believe the denial should be reversed.  The head of the department must respond to your appeal within 10 business days of its receipt.  Under unusual circumstances, the time for response to your appeal may be extended by 10 business days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

We note that the requests are limited only to records in our custody and control.\r\nThe Alameda County Sheriff's Office is in the process of searching for responsive, non-exempt data regarding your request.  After review, we will have a cost estimate for you (if any), and upon receipt of payment from you (if any), we will produce these materials.  If deemed necessary, we may have to produce on a rolling basis. We estimate the search to be complete within three weeks.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your requests, ACSO asserts that certain documents requested may be exempt from disclosure pursuant to Government Code Sections 7927.500, 7927.200, 7927.700, 7923.600-7923.625, 7927.705, 7922.000, 7922.540(a) and possibly additional subsections, and Government Code Sections. ACSO also asserts, certain documents; potentially responsive to your requests, may be shielded by the attorney work product doctrine and the attorney client privilege. Further, some documents may contain confidential information that is protected by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Additional privileges may apply based on a review of the records.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D9EBE9.D37B49C0]\r\nCynthia Wilson | Sheriff's Technician #235\r\nAlameda County Sheriff's Office\r\n\r\nInternal Affairs | 3 Park Pl., 3rd Floor, Dublin, CA 94568",

However, the names of attachments are redacted in the emails (with the exception of agency logos), making it impossible to link which attachments that were produced go with which emails. Nor does the redaction of attachment names in emails correspond to the exceptions cited for redaction in your response (Cal. Gov. Code \u00a7\u00a77927.500 and 7927.705), which address state law prohibitions and draft documents. In any case, the redaction of attachment names is inconsistent with the disclosure of the attachments themselves. \r\n\r\nPlease re-review the emails that were produced and reverse the redaction of attachment names.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

This level of detail aligns with the standards set by New York case law for a \u201creasonably described\u201d request:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tClarity of Subject Matter: As per \u201cMatter of Data Tree, LLC v. Romaine\u201d (9 N.Y.3d 454), my request sufficiently identifies the records sought by focusing on the Essential Worker Criteria and Federal Collaboration for the Erie County Driving Ban.\r\n\t2.\tScope of Search Terms: The specific terms used in my request, such as \u201cEssential Worker Criteria,\u201d \u201cFederal Collaboration,\u201d and \u201cDriving Ban,\u201d meet the standard of a reasonably described request outlined in \u201cM. Farbman & Sons, Inc. v. New York City Health & Hospitals Corp.\u201d (62 N.Y.2d 75).\r\n\t3.\tTime Frame: The defined time period in my request is critical for narrowing down the search, in line with \u201cKonigsberg v. Coughlin\u201d (110 A.D.2d 1026).\r\n\t4.\tIdentification of Potential Record Holders: While individual email accounts are not specified, the suggested departments and officials are likely to hold relevant information, meeting the principle established in \u201cMatter of Capital Newspapers Div. of Hearst Corp. v. Burns\u201d (67 N.Y.2d 562).\r\n\t5.\tNature of Requested Information: The request seeks specific types of records related to a well-defined topic, as supported by \u201cMatter of Gould v. New York City Police Dept.\u201d (89 N.Y.2d 267).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn light of the above analysis, I respectfully request that your office commit to a diligent search for the requested records based on the criteria provided. The nature of this request, its public interest, and its alignment with FOIL guidelines necessitate a thorough and expedited response.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any denial or failure to comply with this request will be subject to appeal. As established in New York case law, the right to appeal is an essential component of FOIL, ensuring transparency and accountability in government operations.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a prompt and comprehensive response.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostscript: Regarding the Adequacy of Search Based on Personal Recollection\r\n\r\nI wish to address a critical point regarding the search for the requested records. The responses received thus far have indicated a reliance on personal knowledge or recollection of the existence of documents. It is important to clarify that the adequacy of a FOIL search cannot be solely based on an individual\u2019s memory or lack thereof.\r\n\r\nAs established in the case of \u201cKey v. Hynes\u201d (205 A.D.2d 779), the mere assertion that an individual does not recall specific documents or that they are unaware of their existence does not fulfill the obligation to conduct a diligent search under FOIL. The court in this case emphasized that an agency must make a genuine effort to search for records using the parameters provided by the requester.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in \u201cNew York Civil Liberties Union v. City of Saratoga Springs\u201d (87 A.D.3d 336), the court held that an agency\u2019s obligation under FOIL is to conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. This means that the search should not be limited to the personal knowledge of a single individual but should extend to a systematic review of the agency\u2019s records.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I respectfully request that the search for records responsive to my FOIL request be conducted in a manner that goes beyond individual recollection and involves a comprehensive review of relevant files, databases, and communication channels within the agency and its departments.\r\n\r\nI trust that this clarification will guide the search process and lead to a more thorough and compliant response under the New York State Freedom of Information Law.\r\n",

I understand the challenges you\u2019ve outlined regarding the search for emails without specific email addresses and the absence of departmental search capabilities.\r\n\r\nTo assist in narrowing down the search and making it less time-consuming, I offer the following additional information and clarification:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tDate Range: As specified in my previous communication, the relevant date range for the search is from June 14, 2022, to the present. This period is critical as it encompasses the development and implementation phases of the essential service portal as discussed in public statements.\r\n\t2.\tSearch Terms: I appreciate the need for specific search terms to facilitate the query. In addition to the terms previously provided, consider including variations and abbreviations that may have been used in communications, such as \u201cEW criteria,\u201d \u201cfederal collab,\u201d \u201cdriving ban portal,\u201d and \u201cessential personnel.\u201d\r\n\t3.\tPotential Sources: While I understand the limitation of not being able to search by department, I suggest focusing on individuals known to be involved in emergency management and response initiatives within Erie County. This includes, but is not limited to, officials within the Office of the County Executive and the Department of Emergency Services. Public statements and articles have mentioned Erie County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz in relation to the portal\u2019s development; communications involving his office may be a fruitful starting point.\r\n\t4.\tLGS-01 Obligations: It\u2019s pertinent to note that under the Local Government Schedule (LGS-01), Erie County has obligations to retain, archive, and make accessible records related to government operations and decisions. This includes initiatives such as the essential worker portal, which is of significant public interest.\r\n\t5.\tCommitment to a Diligent Search: I respectfully request a commitment to a diligent search based on the clarified criteria provided. The public interest in understanding the criteria for essential workers during driving bans and the collaboration with federal entities underscores the importance of this request.\r\n\r\nI understand the complexities involved in processing FOIL requests and appreciate your efforts to comply with the law. Please consider this letter as an attempt to work collaboratively towards fulfilling the request in a manner that respects both the spirit and letter of the Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

Specifically, there are nearly 1500 pages of permitting records for the year 2023.  Previewing and redacting this many files creates a burden on the FOIA Office.

In searching your agency\u2019s web site and/or searching the inventory and use policy submitted to the local governing body to comply with AB 481, we were not able to locate this information regarding patrol rifles for your agency. If your agency posted a military equipment inventory that contains this information (quantity, make, model, caliber of patrol rifles), please direct us to a functioning URL with such inventory or provide a copy of that document. We recognize that some agencies consider patrol rifles to be standard issue (and so do not include them in AB 481 policies) and some agencies do not possess patrol rifles (although most do). \r\n\r\nWe would prefer to receive an inventory of patrol rifles currently possessed by the agency. However, if your agency does not possess an inventory of patrol rifles, we are requesting records with the equivalent information, through purchase records. Other agencies have indicated that such rifles have an expected functional life of between 10 and 20 years, which is why we request such records since 2007 (again, IF the agency does not have records including an inventory of patrol rifles). \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss this request, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, American Friends Service Committee, at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

At this time, the Office of the Mayor\u00a0is seeking an extension of five additional working days to respond to the requests for one or more of the following reasons identified in 5 ILCS 140/3(e) of FOIA: (xx) the requested records are stored in whole or in part at other locations than the office having charge of the requested records; (\u00a0 ) the request requires the collection of a substantial number of specified records; (\u00a0 ) the request is couched in categorical terms and requires an extensive search for the records responsive to it; (\u00a0 ) the requested records have not been located in the course of routine search and additional efforts are being made to locate them; (xx) the requested records require examination and evaluation by personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they are exempt from disclosure under Section 7 of the FOIA or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions; (\u00a0 ) the request for records cannot be complied with by the public body within the time limits prescribed by 5 ILCS 140/3(d) without unduly burdening or interfering with the operations of the public body; (xx) there is need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another public body or among two or more components of a public body having a substantial interest in the determination or in the subject matter of the request.

The Mayor's Office will take no further action or send you any further correspondence unless and until your current request is narrowed in writing.\u00a0 If we do not receive your narrowed request within fourteen calendar days of the date of this letter, your current request will be denied. \r\n\r\nIn the event that we do not receive a narrowed request and your current FOIA request is therefore denied, you have the right to have a denial reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd Street, Springfield, Illinois 62706, (877) 299-3642. You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court. \r\nIf you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office at 312-744-3844.

I recognize the need to balance the burden of fulfilling the request and the public interest in the information. While the latter side of the ledger is difficult to estimate as precisely as you have the former, I would note that the Chicago Fair Workweek Ordinance represents the most expansive labor standard of its kind. Along with a handful of other cities and one state, Chicago has established the most significant new rights and protections on working time since the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. My research seeks to understand the development and implementation of fair workweek laws, a project in which the National Science Foundation found sufficient merit to award me a competitive research fellowship (#2203815).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the considerable public interest in this information, I am willing to narrow my request to the period 1/1/2018\u201312/31/2019. I would still like a copy, preferably in electronic format, of all emails and attachments sent or received by Mayors Emmanuel or Lightfoot during the specified period that contain either of the phrases \"fair workweek\" or \"fair scheduling.\"\r\n\r\nI appreciate your continued assistance and look forward to your response to this narrowed request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel\r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\r\nRutgers School of Management & Labor Relations",

Dear Peter Fugiel, This correspondence is in response to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request received by the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor on June 06, 2023. The Office of the Mayor took a 5 business day extension to your request on June 13, 2023. You requested: \"Requesting to narrow my request to the period 1/1/2018\u201312/31/2019. I would still like a copy, preferably in electronic format, of all emails and attachments sent or received by Mayors Emmanuel or Lightfoot during the specified period that contain either of the phrases \"fair workweek\" or \"fair scheduling.\"\" \nPlease find the attached records responsive to your request. \nWe have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(b) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts \u201cprivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\u201d\u00a0 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b).\u00a0 Section 2(c-5) defines \u201cprivate information\" as: \n\nunique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses. Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. \n\n5 ILCS 140/2(c-5).\u00a0 The material we have redacted under this section is personal email addresses and personal phone numbers.\u00a0 Because these items are specifically exempted under Section 7(1)(b), they have been properly redacted. \nWe have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \n\n[p]ersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information.\u00a0 \u2018Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u2019 means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in in which the subject\u2019s right of privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.\u00a0 The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. \nWe have redacted under Section 7(1)(c) City issued cell phone numbers.\u00a0 As publicly-available City issued cell phone numbers would subject these employees to invasive and unsolicited communications, the disclosure of this information would burden employees\u2019 privacy interest. Additionally, the access to this information would not advance the public interest in understanding \u201cthe affairs of government and the official acts and policies of those who represent them[.]\u201d 5 ILCS 140/1. Further, the landline numbers and other email addresses for these employees is available to the public, which further limits the de minimis public interest in the contact information of the requested employees. See Shurtleff v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 991 F. Supp. 2d 1, 18 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2013) (\u201cThe EPA has proferred a substantial privacy interest at stake in disclosing the official internal email address of the EPA Administrator and the work email address of employees at the EOP: these few individuals have \u2018a significant personal interest in preventing the burden of unsolicited emails and harassment.\u2019\u201d); Buckovetz v. U.S. Department of the Navy, Case No. 14-cv-2115-BEN, 2016 WL 4801335 at *2-3 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 7, 2016) (affirming the redaction of an employee\u2019s cell phone number, because \u201cthe [employee\u2019s] privacy rights in this information outweigh the public\u2019s interest in disclosure\u201d).\u201d \nWe have redacted and withheld certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(f) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \n\nPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. \n\n5 ILCS 140/7(1)(f). The U.S. Supreme Court has determined that the deliberative process exemption under FOIA focuses on documents that reflect \u201cadvisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.\u201d NLRB v. Sears and Roebuck, 421 U.S. 132, 150-151 (1975).\u00a0 The purpose is to encourage \u201cfrank discussion of legal or policy matters\u201d such that employees in government feel free to express their opinions before a final legal or policy decision is made. \u201cDeliberative\u201d has been found to mean being a direct part of the process where recommendations and opinions are expressed. Vaughn v. Rosen, 523 F.2d 1136, 1143-44 (D.C. Cir. 1975). Records where preliminary opinions are expressed and policies and actions are formulated are therefore exempt from production under Section 7(1)(f) of the Illinois FOIA, and have been properly redacted and withheld. \nWe have redacted and withheld certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(m) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \n\nCommunications between a public body and an attorney or auditor representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body, and materials prepared or compiled with respect to internal audits of public bodies. \n\n5 ILCS 140/7(1)(m).\u00a0 Because the redacted and withheld records constituted privileged communications between an attorney and clients, they have been properly redacted and withheld under this section. You have the right to have a denial reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd Street, Springfield, Illinois 62701, (877) 299-3642. You may also seek judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office at 312-744-3844.

For context, the Committee on Workforce Development and Audit, then chaired by Mayor Emanuel's floor leader Patrick O'Connor, held multiple meetings on the proposed Fair Workweek Ordinance in April 2018. Am I to understand that your search return no emails updating Mayor Emanuel of the status of this proposal in the final months of his term in office?\r\n\r\nSecond, could you clarify why certain email attachments (\"Fair Workweek City Comparison 7.20.docx\" and \"BRIEF_0726_Osterman briefing.docx\") were not included in the records provided? It is not clear to me that a document comparing provisions of existing fair workweek laws meets any of the statutory requirements for exemption. The laws are public, so why would a document quoting/summarizing them be withheld? Similarly, I don't understand why a briefing document mentioning fair workweek would not be subject to disclosure now that the law has been enacted and Alderman Osterman and Mayor Lightfoot have left office.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any clarification or additional records you can provide at this time. Given the considerable public interest in the Mayors' leadership around this major piece of policy, I may need to submit additional requests if this one is too narrow to yield relevant records, e.g. from the Emanuel administration.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued attention to this matter,\r\nPeter Fugiel\r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "Dear Requester:\r\n\r\nA properly filed FOIA request must be submitted as stated on EOIR\u2019s website.\r\n\r\nAs of December 1, 2022, EOIR no longer accepts FOIA or PA requests by email. EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request an ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request an ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit an ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request an ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting an ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>\n",

The status of requests submitted by email or mail may not be trackable through the PAL, but you will still receive an email or mailed response to your request upon completion of processing. (https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx) Please ensure the email address you provided in PAL will be able to receive the messages we send you. Messages rejected by your email account will not be rerouted to you. \r\nPlease be aware that EOIR is a component of the Department of Justice\u00a0and the custodian of records for the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (ROP), which is the compilation of documents and digital audio recordings produced in proceedings before the immigration courts and the BIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the custodian of records for the \u201cA-file,\u201d which is a series of records of a person\u2019s immigration history and is maintained and stored by DHS. EOIR is not the custodian of records for DHS or its components, nor does EOIR have access to DHS\u2019s A-files. EOIR does not create an ROP until matters are initiated by DHS. Nevertheless, EOIR may create and maintain ROPs for proceedings other than removal proceedings (i.e., credible fear reviews, bond hearings). You may request a copy of your Notice to Appear (NTA) and full A-file from DHS. (https://www.dhs.gov/foia) \r\nNote that parties to immigration cases (including respondents and their representatives of record) have the option to request their Record of Proceedings directly from the immigration court or Board of Immigration Appeals. Please see the instructions here: https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest. (https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest) \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be significant delay in the processing of your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have filed a fee waiver request, EOIR will address the fee waiver in a separate letter. Most requests for records of proceedings do not require any fees; however, if the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed $25.00, EOIR will notify you before processing the request to determine whether you will commit to paying the fee or whether you wish to narrow the scope of your request to reduce the fee. Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \r\n\r\nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \r\n\r\nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.\u00a0 Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records.\u00a0 As a matter of default, your request has been placed in track two for simple requests.\u00a0 If you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at (703) 605-1297 or EOIR.FOIArequests@usdoj.gov to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request. Alternatively, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at (877) 684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nFOIA Intake",

If upon review of the initial batch of records the requester wishes to narrow the request, the department asks that the requester inform us so that we can respond accordingly.\r\n  *   The department will provide to the requester an explanation of why information housed in the \"Team Foundation Server\" (TFS), which is the system that tracks change requests, cannot be exported/extracted.\r\n\r\n*These dates are contingent upon the number of responsive records and staff availability to search for, gather, and review responsive records. Additional time may be necessary.\r\n\r\nAttached is a revised interim response letter requesting additional time beyond 30 days, or until April 4, 2024, within which to provide a final response to your request. To allow time to complete the tasks that were agreed upon during our conference call, please reply to this email stating that you agree to the additional extension of time for the department to respond to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAndrea Bankes | Agency Open Records Officer\r\nOffice of Administration\r\nDepartment of Human Services\r\nRoom 234 Health & Welfare Building | Hbg PA 17120\r\nPhone: 717.787.3422 | Fax: 717.772.2490\r\nwww.dhs.pa.gov<http://www.dhs.pa.gov/>\r\n\r\nCreating partnerships to deliver quality services to customers through collaboration, consultation and supports.\n",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nA copy of a letter sent to Avril Haines, director of national intelligence, by Representative Rick Crawford, Republican of Arkansas, regarding anomalous health incidents, aka unconventionally-acquired brain injuries, aka Havana Syndrome. This letter is identified in a February 12, 2024 article in the New York Times, attached, as covering \"allegations of improper suppression\" of both information about anomalous health incidents and information about investigations into such claims conducted by American intelligence agencies.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting any supplemental materials that may have been attached to this letter, or in the absence of that, an inventory of all such materials with the names of the individual documents clearly identified.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to its research into anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAnomalous health incidents (AHI) are events occurring between 2016 and the present day that have resulted in a condition, or a series of related conditions, afflicting intelligence agents and diplomats working for the governments of the United States and Canada. In 2017, the Associated Press reported on a number of such incidents that happened in Cuba the year prior that led to the United States pulling staff from its embassy in that country. Since then, AHI have continued to generate considerable media attention and stories focusing on the national security implications have appeared in the New York Times and The New Yorker, among many other publications. Based on sources in the Intelligence Community, journalists working for these publications have suggested that AHI may have been caused by directed energy weapons, or ranged weapons that attack a target with electromagnetic radiation like ultra-high frequency radio waves.\r\n\r\nIn January 2022, however, the Central Intelligence Agency issued an interim report stating that the agency found no evidence to support claims that a foreign adversary such as Russia or China was responsible for causing AHI. This was supported by an intelligence assessment published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on March 1, 2023, which states, in part, \"most [Intelligence Community] agencies have concluded that it is 'very unlikely' a foreign adversary is responsible for the reported AHIs.\"\r\n\r\nAs of January 2024, there have been over 200 reported AHI and many of the victims themselves believe they were subject to attacks by directed energy weapons. Given that most of these individuals have been identified as high-ranking officials across multiple federal agencies, any investigations into claims of AHI and/or the effects of directed energy on humans would be of considerable public interest. This is especially important in light of the fact that, as part of the HAVANA Act of 2021, both Congress and the President approved compensation in the range of $140,000 or $187,000 per person to individuals diagnosed as suffering from AHI.\r\n\r\nAs of February 2024, Representative Brad Wenstrup, Republican of Ohio, and Representative April Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia, introduced a bill titled the Initiating Imperative Reporting on Anomalous Health Incidents Act which would require the Secretary of Defense to brief the House and Senate Armed Services Committees on AHI.\r\n\r\nRep. Crawford's letter to DNI Haines represents another instance of continuing interest in AHI shown by legislators, journalists, and the public and should be made available for public scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Your\r\nrequest was received in this office on January 27, 2020 and assigned the\r\ncase number 21-15142.\r\n\r\nBased on the information available on the Foreign Claims Settlement\r\nCommission website\r\n<https://www.justice.gov/fcsc/claims-against-german-democratic-republic-lead-decisions>,\r\nit appears that the claims you requested relate to the German Democratic\r\nRepublic (East Germany).

If, however, the claims\r\nfiles you seek are not related to East Germany, please let us know.\r\n\r\nThe East Germany Claims Files are fully restricted. Since these records\r\nneed to be reviewed for categories of information exempted from disclosure\r\nunder the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), we are transferring your\r\nrequest to the Special Access and FOIA staff for further action. The\r\nSpecial Access and FOIA staff will be in contact about the status of your\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this a denial of your FOIA request. However, if you are\r\nnot satisfied with our action on this request, your options for appeal and\r\ndispute resolution are outlined in the attachment.

Your request was initially answered by a\r\nNARA staff member from the Textual Reference Archives II Branch who\r\nforwarded your request to this office for a response. Your request was\r\nreceived in this office on February 2, 2021 and assigned FOIA tracking\r\nnumber RD 65006, interim tracking number RF-519.\r\n\r\nBelow please find a summary of my initial assessment of the following East\r\nGermany Claims Files created by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of\r\nthe United States that you requested access to:\r\n\r\n   - file number G-0100 with the claim of Johanna Elsa Rost and Dr. Herbert\r\n   Rost as the subject of the records created between July 1975 and May 1990,\r\n   and consisting of 75 pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n   - file number G-3220 with the claim of Rita Kestenbaum, Eleonore S.\r\n   Rothschild, Jules M. Bier, and Siegfried F. Bier as the subject of the\r\n   records created between May 1978 and July 1990, and consisting of an\r\n   estimated 100 pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n   - file number G-3273 with the claim of Rita Kestenbaum, Eleonore S.\r\n   Rothschild, Jules M. Bier, and Siegfried F. Bier as the subject of the\r\n   records created between May 1978 and July 1990, and consisting of 53 pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n   - file number G-3282 with the claim of Rita Kestenbaum, Eleonore S.\r\n   Rothschild, Jules M. Bier, and Siegfried F. Bier as the subject of the\r\n   records created between May 1978 and July 1990, and consisting of 45 pages.\r\n\r\nThese records require review for information protected from release under\r\nthe FOIA (https://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine).\r\n\r\nYour request does not exceed 700 pages, so it is assigned to our first-tier\r\nprocessing queue. Taking into consideration our existing backlog, we\r\nestimate it will take 39 months to complete processing.\r\n\r\nOnce we notify you that processing is complete, you may either visit our\r\nCollege Park, MD facility to view the file at no cost, or order a\r\nreproduction. Our current fee for reproductions is 80 cents per page, so we\r\nestimate the total cost will be $218.40.\r\n\r\nYou must notify this office of changes to your contact information. If\r\ncommunication is returned as undeliverable and no return address is\r\nprovided, your case will be administratively closed. To change your contact\r\ninformation or to track the status of your request, please email\r\nspecialaccess_foia@nara.gov or call 301-837-3190.
