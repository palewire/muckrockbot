        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the The Missouri Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nInbound phone and fax records for (573) 751-3222 and (573) 751-1495, respectively, for the date range indicated below.\r\n\r\nStart Date: 12:00 AM September 1, 2024\r\nEnd Date: 11:59 PM October 5, 2024\r\n\r\nThe information requested from these records are the following:\r\n\r\n(1) A timestamp indicating the time and date of the inbound call\r\n\r\n(2) An indication of how the call or fax was handled, with the following categorizations. Additional categorizations or details are acceptable to include.\r\n\r\n    Phone Call:\r\n        (2a) Answered by a live person.\r\n        (2b) Directed to voicemail with a message successfully recorded.\r\n        (2c) Directed to voicemail with no message recorded due to a full voice mailbox.\r\n        (2d) Directed to voicemail, but caller hung up or opted not to record a message.\r\n        (2e) Directed to an extension and answered by a live person.\r\n        (2f) Directed to an extension and answered by voicemail with a message successfully recorded. \r\n        (2g) Directed to an extension, answered by voicemail, but no message recorded due to a full voicemail box.\r\n        (2h) Directed to an extension, answered by voicemail, but caller hung up or opted not to record a message.\r\n        (2i) Directed to and answered by a live operator.\r\n        (2j) Directed to an operator, but not answered.\r\n        (2k) Call not answered by live person nor voicemail.\r\n        (2l) Other: Please specify\r\n        \r\n    Fax:\r\n        (2m) Received and job printed successfully at the time of reception.\r\n        (2n) Received but job not printed due to empty paper source.\r\n        (2o) Received but job not printed due to other reason - please specify.\r\n        (2p) Call not answered.\r\n        (2q) Other: Please specify\r\n        \r\n(3) A privacy-preserving, unique identifier derived from the caller's telephone number. \r\n\r\n    This identifier shall establish a 1:1 mapping to the source phone number and remain the same for all instances of the source phone number appearing in the inbound call log. \r\n    \r\n    A clarification: the requester is specifically NOT requesting a new record to be created, but rather, to merely provide the existing information in a different representation. The suggested way to achieve this is to use an HMAC cryptographic operation. The Python (https://www.python.org) script provided below demonstrates how to represent phone numbers as privacy-preserving unique identifiers via HMAC-SHA256.\r\n    \r\n    To preserve the privacy of callers, the requester specifically requests that if HMAC or a similar cryptographic scheme is used to satisfy this request, that the secret key is NOT disclosed in any response or public records, to the extent permitted by law.\r\n    \r\n\r\nExample Python Script:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n#\r\n# An example showing how to represent a log of phone numbers as\r\n# privacy-preserving unique identifiers using HMAC-SHA256.\r\n#\r\n# Below is the expected example output:\r\n# \r\n# Timestamp: 2024-09-07 11:07:55, Status: 2b, Source: 37946e67b0fb1a193350c3f6f228f08df6e1078606a9617578d05868d9c203cc\r\n# Timestamp: 2024-09-10 23:59:12, Status: 2c, Source: 4f6dde6cf83ca4311ad66c8f97616682bd08848a383e7b23b032d602e3d7105d\r\n# Timestamp: 2024-09-15 13:00:35, Status: 2a, Source: ea558425ccced1be9f084efd9df45ae39343e138494a611a0c28877a9bb86f43\r\n# Timestamp: 2024-09-15 20:32:07, Status: 2g, Source: 37946e67b0fb1a193350c3f6f228f08df6e1078606a9617578d05868d9c203cc\r\n#\r\n################################################################################\r\nimport hashlib\r\nimport hmac\r\n\r\n# An example list containing the raw requested information\r\ndata = [\r\n    {'ts': '2024-09-07 11:07:55', 'status': '2b', 'caller': '555-123-4567'},\r\n    {'ts': '2024-09-10 23:59:12', 'status': '2c', 'caller': '555-555-0001'},\r\n    {'ts': '2024-09-15 13:00:35', 'status': '2a', 'caller': '555-555-9876'},\r\n    {'ts': '2024-09-15 20:32:07', 'status': '2g', 'caller': '555-123-4567'},\r\n]\r\n\r\n# IMPORTANT: Replace this value with a secret string of random words\r\n# and DO NOT disclose this secret.\r\nsecret = \"willow dog forbearance hiccup nonsense ant index\".encode('UTF-8')\r\n\r\n# Iterate over the raw data record and print it in the requested representation\r\nfor entry in data:\r\n    source = entry['caller'].encode('UTF-8')\r\n    privacy_id = hmac.digest(secret, source, hashlib.sha256).hex()\r\n\r\n    output = 'Timestamp: {:s}, Status: {:s}, Source: {:s}'\r\n    print(output.format(entry['ts'], entry['status'], privacy_id))\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThe requester of this information is willing to provide pro bono technical education and assistance with respect to this request, in a manner consistent with any specified IT restrictions and limitations.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
