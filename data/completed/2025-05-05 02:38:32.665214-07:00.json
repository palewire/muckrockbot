        "communication": "Dear Ms. Stuecker and team,\r\n\r\nThank you for your thoughtful and prompt response to our open records request. We sincerely appreciate the data and links you provided, especially the self-report/referral breakdown and references to the Iowa Administrative Code and relevant statutes.\r\n\r\nWe understand the need for confidentiality in individual cases. However, we respectfully believe there may be a misunderstanding regarding the scope of Iowa Code \u00a721.5(g). While this provision clearly protects specific case discussions or investigative matters, it does not appear to prohibit disclosure of general policies, administrative procedures, or contractual agreements that govern the operation of the Physician Health Program (PHP). Such documents are essential for public transparency and are not inherently protected merely by their association with a confidential program.\r\n\r\nBecause this issue is a central component of our national research into PHP structures and oversight, we kindly submit the following follow-up requests:\r\n\r\nAny contracts or memoranda of understanding between the Iowa Medical Board and the Iowa PHP or any third-party entities managing physician monitoring, including the Professional Assistance Program.\r\n\r\nThese may be redacted as needed to protect names or private health information.\r\n\r\nMeeting minutes from the Physician Health Committee (or equivalent) between 2019 and 2024, specifically those addressing program operations, procedural updates, or structural evaluations.\r\n\r\nWe are not seeking identifiable physician information and are happy to accept redacted copies if necessary.\r\n\r\nFinally, we respectfully encourage your department to consider conducting or commissioning an internal audit or outcomes assessment of the program\u2019s long-term effectiveness, including return-to-practice metrics, physician feedback, and support outcomes. We note that the absence of such data is common among many states, but also represents a gap in quality assurance that merits attention.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time, cooperation, and ongoing commitment to public service. We look forward to your reply and will gladly work with your office to clarify any aspects of this request.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,",

You requested the following: \r\nTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nA log of all emails to/from the Kylie Kosmacek, from March 1, 2025 - March 31, 2025. \r\n\r\n1. Please search all CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business.

The search parameters you provided yielded an initial count of approximately 5,385 lines of emails and attachments. \r\nIn order to comply with this request, each and every of the approximate 5,385 lines in this log would have to be reviewed to determine if it is exempt from disclosure. In the employee\u2019s role as a director in safety operations and programs, there are many subject lines naming students that pertain to their well-being, as well as addresses of various incidents in subject lines that would have to be manually determined and cross-referenced to determine if they pertain to a student\u2019s home address or not. As such, the processing and reviewing such a large volume of records for responsiveness as well as for information exempt from release under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, such as personally private information and information exempt from disclosure under the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA) would be estimated to take dozens of hours. Moreover, your request fails to establish a public interest and such request would clearly burden the operations of CPS beyond the public interest in this information. \r\nThis is not an automatic denial of your request. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g), the District is extending an opportunity to confer to narrow your request to more manageable proportions, such as providing keywords or additional specific custodians within five (5) business days. If you choose not to do so, this response will be considered denied pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(g). \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Please note that certain private information (personal descriptions, employee ID numbers, personal addresses, personal email addresses, names of potential job candidates, etc.) was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7. Specifically, section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. Student information has been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). Section 7(1)(n) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201cRecords relating to a public body's adjudication of employee grievances or disciplinary cases; however, this exemption shall not extend to the final outcome of cases in which discipline is imposed.\u201d You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).

While it is my understanding the Paperwork Reduction Act does not necessarily require publishing changes sought from OMB, it is difficult, if not impossible, to making meaningful public comments to OMB about the proposed changes.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Education claims the proposed changes will decrease the public burden by OVER TWO MILLION HOURS. This is a substantial change. Therefore, I am requesting a fee waiver, as the Department of Education press release states, but does not specify, vague policy changes. It is in the public interest to understand these policy changes, how it may impact public burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act, and how other organizations who rely on the FAFSA, including state universities, will be affected by these changes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKarl Koscher",

        "communication": "Andrew Free \r\nN/A \r\nMuckRock News, DEPT MR138080 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \r\n\r\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2023-ICFO-07519 \r\n\r\nDear Requester: \r\n\r\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 12/20/2022.  You have requested all processing notes, taskers, initial receipting documents, and any other records relating to the ICE FOIA Office\u2019s processing of 2023-ICFO-06896 and 2023-ICFO-05446.. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \r\n\r\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \r\n\r\nA search of the ICE Office of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for records responsive to your request produced 4 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 4 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nICE has applied FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure internal agency case numbers and internal agency URLs contained within the document. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I have determined that disclosure of certain law enforcement sensitive information contained within the responsive records could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nMegan Davis \r\nDeputy FOIA Officer, Operations \r\n\r\nEnclosure(s):\t4 Pages \r\nNote: If you are receiving this message by email and responsive records are not included as an attachment to the email, please log in to your SecureRelease portal account to view the responsive records.",

Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3. The current administration's expansion of federal immigration detention is the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Daniel Edgington at 500 12th Street, SW, Washington DC 20536 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25061.

Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.

        "communication": "I appeal the agency's blanket b7A assertion on two grounds. \r\n\r\nFirst, there is no \"ongoing law enforcement investigation[]\" that could result in a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, as required to invoke Exemption 7A. Rather, the investigations ICE performs following an in-custody death -- IHSC Mortality Reviews, Root Cause Analyses, Healthcare and Security Compliance Analyses, and Detainee Death Reviews, pertain solely to \"oversight of the performance of duties\", rather than an investigation into violations of laws. See, e.g., Jefferson v. DOJ, 284 F.3d 172, 178 (D.C. Cir. 2002). They cannot be fairly characterized, based upon ICE's publicly available policies and procedures and the history of its post-death inspections, to anything constituting an \"enforcement proceeding.\" Consequently, they do not meet Exemption 7A's requirements. Miller v. DOJ, 872 F. Supp. 2d 12, 24-25 (D.D.C. 2012) (explaining that focus is on circumstances of compilation and whether records relate to enforcement proceeding (citing Jefferson 284 F.3d at 176-77)); Rural Hous. All. v. USDA, 498 F.2d 73, 82 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (explaining that purpose of investigatory files is critical factor in establishing law enforcement threshold); Pub. Emps. for Env't Resp. v. U.S. Sec'y. Int'l Boundary & Water Comm'n, 839 F. Supp. 2d 304, 324 (D.D.C. 2012) (explaining that in \"assessing whether records were compiled for law enforcement purposes, the 'focus is on how and under what circumstances the requested files were compiled, and whether the files sought relate to anything that can fairly be characterized as an enforcement proceeding'\" (quoting Jefferson, 284 F.3d at 176-77)), aff'd in pertinent part & rev'd on other grounds, 740 F.3d 195 (D.C. Cir. 2014).\r\n\r\nSecond, even if the agency were able to show its allegedly ongoing investigations satisfy the threshold for invoking Exemption 7A, the blanket assertion of the exemption to all potentially responsive records is unlawful and improper. A record-by-record analysis is required to determine whether there is any reasonably segregable, releasable portion of the responsive documents that would not interfere with the ongoing investigation. But ICE did not conduct this analysis. According to the Department of Justice and every court to review agencies\u2019 assertions of the power to engage in blanket 7A withholdings simply because of the existence of an investigation, blanket withholding is unlawful. See, e.g., https://www.justice.gov/oip/page/file/1197166/download at page 11: \u201cWhile generalized showings of harm are accepted, courts have also cautioned that the exemption [7A] does not permit \u2018blanket\u2019 withholding.\u201d See, e.g., Cuban, 744 F. Supp. 2d at 85 (D.D.C. 2010) (stressing that exemption does not permit \"blanket\" withholding for all records relevant to investigation); UtahAmerica Energy v. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 700 F. Supp. 2d 99, 109 (D.D.C. 2010), rev'd in part, vacated in part sub nom. UtahAmerica Energy, Inc. v. Dep't of Labor, 685 F.3d 1118 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (reiterating that \"automatic, or wholesale withholdings\" are not authorized simply because law enforcement proceeding is ongoing); United Am. Fin. v. Potter, 531 F. Supp. 2d 29, 3840 (D.D.C. 2008) (reiterating that the agency \u2018should be mindful of the standards applicable in this Circuit\" and that even under categorical approach, agency must review each document because there is \"no 'blanket exemption'\"); Gould Inc. v. GSA, 688 F. Supp. 689, 703-04 n.34 (D.D.C. 1988) (describing generic categories approach as steering \"middle ground\" between detail required by Vaughn Index and blanket withholding).\r\n\r\nPlease grant expedited processing of this appeal, reverse the decision of the FOIA office, and remand to the agency with instructions to release the record in full. \r\n\r\nThank you very much, \r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    A copy of the report and, if they are separate things, a copy of the\r\n    \"contingency plan\" regarding the proposed merger between FBI and DEA which\r\n    are described in the attached document previously released by the Bureau.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look\r\n    forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days,\r\n    as the statute requires.\r\n    \r\n    Sincerely,\r\n    \r\n    Emma Best\r\n    \r\n    Attachments:\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    https://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/EmmaBest/74225/Fee20category20and20search20parameters.pdf\r\n    Upload documents directly:\r\n    https://https://www.muckrock.comhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?url_auth_token=AAAj2ProGzquHYFeb-SMkiAXsEc%3A1hzvi2%3A73EIEk0ygWoWR3AlO21-BoIKudo&next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Ffederal-bureau-of-investigation-10%252Ffbidea-1987-proposed-merger-report-79066%252F%253Femail%253Dfoipaquestions%252540ic.fbi.gov\r\n\r\n** \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress.

If any 911 calls or additional footage (such as surveillance) exist, I request them only if they provide significant additional context to the events.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nI request a fee waiver as the release of these records serves the public interest by providing transparency regarding law enforcement actions and the use of force.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in digital format via email or a secure online portal if available. If any associated fees apply, please inform me before processing. If any portion of this request is denied or redacted, please cite the specific exemption under Georgia law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance. Please confirm receipt of this request at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPolice Cam News",

This request should be re-directed by the requestor to either of those entities.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  All contracts and bills from the Humboldt Conservation Camp regarding the 2011 \"general clean up\" cooperated by a Stor-All location in Winnemucca as found in Appendix A in Division of forestry, LA14-01 full.pdf<https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Division/audit/full/BE2014/Division%20of%20forestry,%20LA14-01%20full.pdf>\r\n\r\nAgency Response: Due to the State of Nevada General Records Retention Schedule Version, dated 02/12/2025*, NDF does not have any previous contracts and or billing invoices from the Humboldt Conservation camp regarding the 2011 \"general clean up\" work performed for Stor-Al Winnemucca location.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the agency's response to the Muchrock public information request dated 3/6/25.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRyan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DBBAAA.F19063A0]<https://forestry.nv.gov/>\r\n\r\nRyan S.

Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3. The current administration's expansion of federal immigration detention is the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Edixon Del Jesus Farias Farias who died in ICE Custody April 18, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrFarias-FariasEdixondelJesus.pdf. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \r\n\r\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \r\n\r\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \r\n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \r\n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \r\n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \r\n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \r\n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \r\n\r\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25067. Please use this number in future correspondence. \r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

Your request was received in this office on 11/7/2023.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.

You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability.

You are seeking policy for ICE issued mobile devices. \r\n\r\nThese documents are on the ICE FOIA Libriary at the links below. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/policy/4004.1_UseICE_IssuedMobileDevices_attUserAgreement.pdf \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/policy/4004.1_UseICE_IssuedMobileDevices.pdf \r\n\r\nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nMegan Davis \r\nDeputy FOIA Officer, Operations",

Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

That being said, we typically try to release records within 2 business days after receiving payment. I wanted to reach out to let you know that if you'd like, I can have the records available to pick up at SPD Headquarters on 5th Ave or I can mail the records to you by the end of this week. If I do not hear from you by Thursday, 12/15/22 (or the issue has been resolved by then), I will plan on uploading the records ASAP and notifying you when they are available to download. \r\n\r\nThank you for your patience and understanding! \r\n\r\n-Mack.

This installment includes additional emails responsive to\u00a0 your request. As a reminder, we had conducted a search for responsive emails with the following search parameters: \r\nMailboxes searched: all SPD mailboxes \r\nKeywords searched: \"Tac 9\" OR \"Tactical 9\" OR \"Tac Nine\" OR \"Tactical Nine\" OR \"Encrypt\" OR \"Encrypted\" OR \"Encryption\" OR \"45136\" \r\nDates searched: 1/01/2020 - 9/22/2020 \r\nThis search resulted in approximately 48,520 responsive emails. We estimate that on average, we can review 100 emails in 1 hour and we can devote around 1 hour a week to a request (depending the current workload of the unit). With that, it will take at least 10 years to complete your public disclosure request. \r\nPlease let us know if you would like to adjust the search parameters to best provide you with the records you are seeking. Otherwise, we will continue to review and provide records with the search terms above and will provide the next installment of records to you by 05/12/2023.
