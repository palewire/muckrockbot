These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\n\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\n\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\n\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKayla Fox",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\n\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\n\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\n\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKayla Fox",

Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

I will need time to review the records and provide a cost estimate.\r\nEven once I provide the cost estimate, and you pay the deposit, this request will take a significant amount of time to produce as all records will have to be reviewed and redacted. When I provide the cost estimate I will also provide an updated time estimate.  This request will require multiple installments.  I will provide a cost and updated time estimate by December 19, 2022.\r\n\r\n****Your email indicated you declined using a 3rd party \u2018portal\u2019.\r\nDue to the size of these documents, they would need to be provided through the Auburn School District Microsoft SharePoint.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2021 can be excluded from this request.\r\n**NOTE: PRR #2021-014 - This request was for student transcripts.  Per your request, these response documents are not included.\r\n**NOTE: PRR #2021-007 - This request was from a parent for student classwork. On January 16, 2023, MuckRock removed PRR #2021-007 from the request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first and second installment on your public records request are available. The first two installments include all responsive records except for the six public records requests that need redacting. All remaining materials will be included in installment three (3).\r\n\r\nThe district uses SharePoint to deliver response documents.\r\nYour documents are stored in a SharePoint folder.  I have just shared that folder with you.\r\n\r\nYou will receive an email directly from SharePoint to the folder with your files.\r\nYou will then go through a short process to get an access code from SharePoint. That code will come in a second email from SharePoint to you.  If you do not receive the email right away, please check your spam folder.\r\n\r\n**Please review your documents within thirty (30) days. Per RCW 42.56.120(4), if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have trouble or if you have additional questions.\r\n\r\nAt any time that you no longer need the requested information in your public records request, please let me know. I will provide an update or the next installment on or before March 17, 2023.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLisa Connors\r\nPublic Records and Compliance Coordinator\r\nAuburn School District\r\n\r\nD: 253-887-3955\r\nP: 253-931-4900\r\nE: lconnors@auburn.wednet.edu<mailto:lconnors@auburn.wednet.edu>\n915 4th Street NE, Auburn, WA 98002\r\nwww.auburn.wednet.edu<http://www.auburn.wednet.edu/>",

Your request was received in this office on 6/13/23 and\r\nassigned FOIA tracking number 23-47523.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to maps, charts, and plans relating to Operation\r\nMatterhorn. While we don't hold records specific to Operation Matterhorn,\r\nwe hold two main series of records that might prove useful to your research.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first series is in our Record Group 18, Records of the Army Air Forces.\r\nWe hold a series of World Aeronautical Charts that would have been used at\r\nthe time in the planning and execution of offensive bombing missions. These\r\ncharts are filed by WAC number, and we'll attach scans for charts 377 and\r\n378, which cover western Japan. We'll also include a copy of the back of\r\none of the sheets, which includes information on interpreting the chart and\r\nan index with the other WAC numbers. Those charts are open and available\r\nfor use; if you visit the archives you can pull them with the citation \"RG\r\n18: WAC Charts, [WAC #].\" You can see the description for that series\r\nonline via our catalog at https://catalog.archives.gov/id/649649.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also hold a series of Air Objective Folders that include specific\r\ninformation on various bombing targets. Each subject in that series was\r\nassigned a target number by the air force, and the records are filed by\r\nthat number. We'll attach a finding aid that lists the target numbers for\r\nthe objectives we hold. These objective folders include maps and\r\nphotographs of the target areas, as well as textual descriptions about the\r\nnature of each target. These records are also available for use and can be\r\npulled using the citation \"RG 18: Air Objective Folders, [Objective #].\"\r\nYou can see the description for that series online via our catalog at\r\nhttps://catalog.archives.gov/id/6050528.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs reviewed under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act, there are no\r\nrestrictions on access and these records are open and available for\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request. If you have additional\r\nquestions concerning my review of these records, please contact me directly\r\nat ryan.mcpherson@nara.gov.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with my action on this request, you have the right\r\nto file an administrative appeal within ninety (90) calendar days from the\r\ndate of this letter. Appeals must be in writing and may be delivered by\r\nregular U.S. mail or by e-mail.

Organizations wishing to participate in the mobility program must first submit request for certification packets to the agency with which they seek to partner. Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

One of the most devastating of these bombings occurred on March 16-17, 1945, during which the city was heavily damaged and civilian casualties were extensive.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nOfficial military reports, planning documents, and after-action reviews related to the Bombing of Kobe.\r\nCommunications, memos, or letters involving military commanders and personnel discussing the planning, execution, and aftermath of the Bombing of Kobe.\r\nAny photographs, maps, or other visual materials produced or collected during the operation.\r\nRecords of any investigations, inquiries, or tribunals associated with the Bombing of Kobe.\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

Your request was received in the Moving Image and Sound\r\nBranch on June 6th and assigned FOIA tracking number 2346346. You requested\r\ninformation regarding the bombing of Kobe during World War II.\r\n\r\nWe searched the Moving Image and Sound Branch\u2019s records and finding aids\r\nusing the term Kobe, and located the following records related to your\r\nrequest among the records of the US Army Air Forces (Record Group 18), the\r\nRecords of the Office of the Chief Signal Officer (Record Group 111), Records\r\nof U.S. Air Force Commands, Activities, and Organizations\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/654> (Record Group 342), and General\r\nRecords of the Department of the Navy (Record Group 428):\r\n\r\n\r\n   - RAID ON KOBE, REVIEW OF MISSION- Local Identifier 18-CS-3425\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/4914>\r\n   - B-29'S BOMB KOBE, JAPAN - Local Identifier: 18-CS-4046\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/5299>\r\n   - B-29 BOMBINGS - Local Identifier: 111-ADC-10499\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/24260>\r\n   - PHYSICAL DAMAGE, KOBE, JAPAN - Local Identifier: 342-USAF-11035\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/64480>\r\n   - PHYSICAL DAMAGE, KOBE, JAPAN - Local Identifier: 342-USAF-11048\r\n   <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/64495>\r\n   - JAPANESE BEACHED , SUNK, AND DAMAGED SHIPPING - Local Identifier:\r\n   342-USAF-11051 <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/64499>\r\n   - AERIAL COVERAGE, CITIES AND EFFECT OF AERIAL MINES - Local Identifier:\r\n   342-USAF-11058 <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/64506>\r\n   - GUN CAMERA OF ATTACKS ON TOKYO BAY AND THE NAGOYA AREA - Local\r\n   Identifier: 428-NPC-2793 <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/76536>\r\n\r\nSome of these items are available to be viewed and downloaded from the\r\ncatalog. I will outline ways to access the other records below.\r\n\r\nFor the records with an unsupported file type (the 342-USAF records), you\r\nmay still download the files from the catalog. They just do not play in the\r\ncatalog interface.\r\n\r\nFor the 18-CS-3425, we have a reference film print available for\r\nresearchers to access. You are welcome to schedule an appointment with the\r\nMoving Image Branch at the National Archives at College Park and make a\r\ncopy of these items using our equipment. Research visits are by appointment\r\nonly. If you would like to schedule an appointment, please visit the NARA\r\nat College Park, Moving Image & Sound Branch Eventbrite page\r\n<https://www.eventbrite.com/o/nara-at-college-park-moving-image-amp-sound-branch-47491498583>.\r\nAppointments are released up to three months in advance, and close a full\r\nbusiness day before the appointment date. For next operating day\r\nappointments, please email mopix@nara.com\r\n\r\nFor the 18-CS-4046, we do not have a reference copy available to\r\nresearchers. In order to access it you will either need to order it from\r\nour vendor as outlined below or you will need to request that we make a\r\nreference copy.\r\n\r\nThe Moving Image and Sound Branch is currently piloting a service to accept\r\nand fulfill requests online for new reference copies of our holdings to\r\noffsite researchers. At this time, there will be no charge for this\r\nservice. In order to provide consistent and equitable service within the\r\nallowances of our policies, technology and staffing, we are setting a limit\r\nof five reels per researcher or research team per month, addressed on a\r\nfirst come first served basis in the order received. If an item consists of\r\nmultiple reels or tapes, each reel or tape will be counted individually\r\namong the five.\r\n\r\nAll requestors are required to register as National Archives researchers.\r\nIf you are not currently registered, please follow these two steps:.\r\n\r\n\r\n   1.\r\n\r\n   Complete the online Researcher Orientation\r\n   <https://rise.articulate.com/share/uK5NGkSpg74JHLTOcGPmM4e94MJyxQgD#/>.\r\n   2.\r\n\r\n   Complete the separate registration form here:\r\n   https://researchercommunity.force.com/securitycentral/s/kiosk-registration\r\n   <https://researchercommunity.force.com/securitycentral/s/kiosk-registration>\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will not receive your researcher number automatically. We will need to\r\nreview and approve your registration. When you have completed the\r\nregistration, please email mopix@nara.gov and confirm you have completed\r\nboth steps. We will approve your registration, and send you your researcher\r\ncard number.\r\n\r\nOnce your registration is complete, please submit your request by entering\r\nup to five reels of choice on the attached form. Please see the attached\r\nGeneral Notice and Use Statement for additional information.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to visit NARA in person, you may wish to hire a\r\nprofessional researcher to assist you. A list of experienced professionals\r\nis made available as a courtesy on NARA's web site here\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/research/hire-help/media.html?format=motion-pictures>\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe final method of receiving copies would be to go through a vendor. Going\r\nthrough a vendor is what we recommend if you want to get broadcast quality\r\ncopies. For this method, you will fill out an IARL form and send that into\r\nmopix@nara.gov. We will review the information and send it back to you once\r\nit has been approved. Once you have the approved form, you may contact one\r\nof our certified vendors\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/research/motion-pictures/vendors>. Once you have\r\nchosen a vendor, the vendor then will contact us to order the films and\r\nmake a copy of the film in the format that you request. They will then send\r\nthat new copy to you. We advise screening a reference copy before placing\r\nan order through the vendor system, as legacy descriptions may contain\r\nerrors.\r\n\r\nI have linked our page with more detailed instructions on ordering from the\r\nvendors here\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/research/motion-pictures/broadcast-quality>.\r\n\r\nEffective November 1 2021, the Moving Image and Sound Branch is accepting\r\nItem Approval Request Lists (IARL) Form (NA 14110) and reproduction orders.\r\nRequests will be addressed in the order received, and orders will be filled\r\nwith some notable limitations in place as detailed in the attached\r\nnotification. Instructions for submitting your requests are available on\r\nour website here\r\n<https://www.archives.gov/research/motion-pictures/order-copies-of-motion-pictures-sound-recordings-and-video>.\r\nServices are subject to change based on local health metrics, and we\r\nappreciate your patience as we progress through NARA's planned reentry.\r\n\r\nAdditional information regarding the National Archives response to the\r\ncoronavirus public health emergency, and updates on our status can be found\r\nhere: https://www.archives.gov/coronavirus and here:\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/research/motion-pictures\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that more extensive research may be able to locate\r\nadditional content. We invite you to search our online catalog, visit us,\r\nor hire a researcher to help with this additional research. If any of the\r\nrecords described in the catalog interest you, please be sure to note the\r\nLocal Identifier Number. The Local Identifier Number is the number that the\r\nMotion Picture, Sound and Video staff use to locate and identify our films\r\nand will be the number you use to order any films if you choose to do so.\r\n\r\nNone of these records are restricted or classified in any way, so no\r\nfurther FOIA review should be necessary. This concludes the processing of\r\nyour request. If you have additional questions, please contact me directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with our action on this request, you have the\r\nright to file an administrative appeal within ninety (90) calendar days\r\nfrom the date of this letter. Appeals must be in writing and may be\r\ndelivered by regular U.S. mail or by e-mail.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files mentioning or describing the creation or use of the Investigative\r\n    Support Information System (ISIS), including but not limited to manuals,\r\n    guides and briefings.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Any policy, guidance, handbook, manual, or standard contract concerning the institution\u2019s interactions or relationship with members of the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\n2. Any policy, guidance, handbook, or manual concerning the interactions or communications of institutional employees, including faculty, administrators, staff, and student employees, with the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnne Marie Tamburro",

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, I am requesting access to the list of Twitter profiles blocked by the Ossining Police Department's official Twitter account (@OssiningPolice).\r\n\r\nTo assist you in locating these records, please follow the steps below to view the blocked profiles:\r\n\r\nLog into the @OssiningPolice Twitter account.\r\nClick on 'More' in the menu on the left-hand side.\r\nClick on 'Settings and privacy'.\r\nSelect 'Privacy and safety'.\r\nScroll down to 'Safety' and click on 'Blocked accounts'. Here, you will find the list of all blocked profiles.\r\nGiven that these records relate to a public department's social media, which is utilized for communication with and among the public, they should fall within the purview of the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nI would like to draw your attention to two cases related to social media blocking and the First Amendment. The first is Knight First Amendment Institute v. Trump (2017), where the court found that blocking users from an official's Twitter account, which is used as a public forum, is a violation of their First Amendment rights. The second is Davison v. Randall (2019), where the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals extended this reasoning to local officials.\r\n\r\nWhile these cases deal with blocking individuals on Twitter, they provide the legal context under which public officials and departments must operate when considering whether to block individuals from their social media accounts.\r\n\r\nGiven these precedents, the block list of the Ossining Police Department's Twitter account should constitute disclosable public records under the FOIA as they pertain to potential infringements on First Amendment activity.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the second installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link: https://app.box.com/shared/static/3gg5cud3r1xrcb9byk4tgqqrmeagsiqv.pdf Due to the COVID-19 restrictions, we have extended the access to this link until May 18, 2020.

If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me. All redactions are due to personal privacy RCW 42.56.230 (3).\r\n\r\nWe are currently looking for any responsive records and at this time I estimate that it will take approximately thirty to sixty days to prepare records located that are responsive parts 1 and 2 of your request.\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer.  Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  I am seeking clarification on this portion of the request.  If you can narrow your requested records types, be more specific to the types of records for which you are seeking or provide additional search terms this may reduce the estimate of time. Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the fifth installment which includes records responsive to number three by following this link: https://app.box.com/s/kpjb5bm0ha4pareszob74o1v58jblgue This link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by August 8, 2020, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify of the exemptions, however, it our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Therefore, we have chosen to notify you within the previous letters. If we find more than one exemption type in future installments, we will create a log noting these exemptions.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer.  Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  I am seeking clarification on this portion of the request.  If you can narrow your requested records types, be more specific to the types of records for which you are seeking or provide additional search terms this may reduce the estimate of time. Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated I estimate that it will take, at a minimum, one year to produce the records.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible.

I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the eighth installment which includes records responsive to number three by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/shared/static/co1df7tx97rzyjpgiri4iai9ihlrmxqh.pdf  This link will be deactivated in 30 days.\r\nIf you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by November 2, 2020, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions, however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Therefore, we have chosen to notify you within the previous letters. If we find more than one exemption type in future installments, we will create a log noting these exemptions.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer.  Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  I am seeking clarification on this portion of the request. Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated I estimate that it will take, at a minimum, one year to produce the records.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month. I will contact you on or about October 3, 2020 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 009020-009786\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D3ECFB.30F42750]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the tenth installment which includes records responsive to number three by following this link: https://app.box.com/s/1ahxwm28uvc8so10961325o75y2u5de4\r\nIf you need any assistance accessing this link, please let me know. This link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by January 11, 2021, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions, however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Therefore, we have chosen to notify you within the previous letters. If we find more than one exemption type in future installments, we will create a log noting these exemptions.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer.  Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  I am seeking clarification on this portion of the request. Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated I estimate that it will take, at a minimum, one year to produce the records.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month. I will contact you on or about January 11, 2021 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 009980-010085\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D3ECFB.30F42750]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately two weeks, on March 25, 2021. I will contact you on or about March 25, 2021 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 010470-010794\r\n                       2021 03 11 Exemption Log PRR 2020-00019\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D71685.A8B6E960]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nPlease find the fourteenth installment which includes records responsive to number three by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/gmk3g30s5kaaf98yoeqp3ea8vvt9anvs\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by April 25, 2021, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the thirteenth installment, there is an exemption log noting another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nPlease find the seventeenth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/054snktthcad2ezmlmkp6ov3qke3jzmh\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by June 14, 2021, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the thirteenth and fourteenth installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the fifteenth or sixteenth installments and there are no exemptions for this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately two weeks, on May 28, 2021. I will contact you on or about May 28, 2021 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 014595-016691\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D748DB.32399070]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nPlease find the seventeenth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/idpk70nsxd7cnpjb3ztz5wsinvfpwq0s\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by August 30, 2021, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the thirteenth and fourteenth installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth installments, nineteenth and there are no exemptions for this current installment.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, August 30, 2021. I will contact you on or about August 30, 2021 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 020940-025489\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D784C1.590567C0]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nPlease find the twenty-third installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/9p99aiernbwei2e5dol5lyykxpnxii3b\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by December 12, 2021, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with this installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, December 12, 2021. I will contact you on or about December 12, 2021 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 030944-032800\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D7D7AF.CEA7EFC0]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the twenty-fourth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/i83bf4xjifnjw4ly51h5uesxhwur2yh5\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by March 24, 2022, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, March 24, 2022. I will contact you on or about March 24, 2022 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 036997-038780\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D82986.6871BAF0]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the thirtieth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/joyiwum69mmen1ehyi4jw2fv803xmy0x\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by July 23, 2022, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, July 23, 2022. I will contact you on or about July 23, 2022 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 044178-045842\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D8871D.CFC25350]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, October 22, 2022. I will contact you on or about October 22, 2022 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosure:       Bates Numbers 049938-052060\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D8CE96.8BA2FB00]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 34th or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments.  I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, 9, 2023. I will contact you on or about January 9, 2023 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\nBates Numbers 052207-053509\r\nEmployee Discipline and Misconduct Workshop Materials_NOV 2015\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D90BDA.31D66310]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan R.

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request an electronic copy of all email communications between any employee of the Tacoma Public Schools and any member of the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\n\r\n2. I request an electronic copy of all emails in the possession of the Tacoma Public Schools to or from any user of the internet domain WSPA.NET for the years 2016-2020.\r\n\r\n3. I request an electronic copy of all RECORDS and WRITING, documents, agreements, meetings, papers, scheduling, etc. referencing the Washington School Personnel Association for the years 2014-2020.\r\nPlease find the thirty-ninth installment which includes records responsive to number one by following this link:\r\nhttps://app.box.com/s/2dmpccwpybv6hrlf4a26makxskk0hqrr\r\n\r\nThis link will be deactivated in 30 days.  If you have not accessed this link and downloaded the records by April 16, 2023, I will assume you no longer require these records and will close the request. If you need any assistance accessing these records, please contact me.\r\n\r\nIn response to your email received 6/24/20, we acknowledge that you have declined to narrow down the request and understand that the third portion of this request will take a considerable amount of time. We are required to notify you of the exemptions; however, it is at our discretion how to log that information. As of the previous installments, all exemptions were due to one exemption type. Along with the 13th and 14th installments, the exemption logs provided noted another exemption type other than being due to employee privacy. There were no exemptions with the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st installments. There was an exemption for the 22nd installment and there are no exemptions with the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 34th, 35th, 36th, 37th, 38th or this current installment.\r\n\r\nPart 3 of your request will take considerably longer. Based on an initial search, there are over 20,000 emails that are responsive to this portion.  This does not include any non-email records that I might find within the school district.  Because this portion of your request is so broad, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it will take to produce all records. With that stated, the original estimate of one year will need to be extended to produce the records. At this point, we will provide estimates per installment. We estimate that there will be several more installments.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request will be provided in installments. I estimate the next installment will be available in approximately one month, May 17, 2023.

        "communication": "Dear Records Access Officer:\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal of OOM's determination regarding FOIL request FOIL-2022-002-00358 on February 24, 2023, as well as its determinations on June 15, 2022; September 13, 2022; October 25, 2022; and December 27, 2022. All of the determinations extended the time to respond to my request.\r\n\r\nOOM has constructively denied my request. The repeated delays, which have now extended nearly 10 months after I submitted the request on April 26, 2022, are unreasonable given the narrow scope of the request.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, OOM is required by law to provide specific reasons within 10 business days explaining why this request cannot be fulfilled in a timely manner, or else, must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by the specific date given beyond 20 business days, or if the specific date given is unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied (see \u00a789[4][a]). In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you either fulfill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial, as required by law, of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",

All of the determinations extended the time to respond to my request.\r\n\r\nOOM has constructively denied my request. The repeated delays, which have now extended more than 10 months after I submitted the request on March 24, 2022, are unreasonable given the narrow scope of the request.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, OOM is required by law to provide specific reasons within 10 business days explaining why this request cannot be fulfilled in a timely manner, or else, must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by the specific date given beyond 20 business days, or if the specific date given is unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied (see \u00a789[4][a]). In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am requesting that you either fulfill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial, as required by law, of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\n\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\n\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\n\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKayla Fox",
