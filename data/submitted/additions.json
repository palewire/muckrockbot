Penn submitted a letter with their request after the Mayor's office asked for one, the spokesperson added. They also said that the mayor\u2019s office requested additional information from Penn, and that the University is in the process of providing it.\" (https://www.thedp.com/article/2024/04/live-updates-penn-pro-palestinian-gaza-solidarity-encampment-day-eight)\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am requesting both the letter and any follow-up sent by the university.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",
