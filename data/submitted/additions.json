The renewal application date for the permit was September 30, 2020. The current NPDES permit is not accessible through the NPDES database for Puerto Rico administered by EPA Region 2.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the EPA database for NPDES permits for Puerto Rico, there are multiple NPDES permits that have seemingly gone past their expiration date without being renewed. The database can be found here:  https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/puerto-rico-npdes-permits\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1) Every current NPDES permit for Puerto Rico. To aid in your search, a list of facilities can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/puerto-rico-npdes-permits\r\n\r\n2) Any document certifying which NPDES permits for Puerto Rico have been \"administratively extended.\"\r\n\r\nKeywords: \"administratively extended,\" \"Puerto Rico,\" and \"NPDES\"\r\n\r\nThis request is for all records produced between January 1, 2015 and the date this request is processed. Please send records to me on a rolling basis. Please omit any duplicate records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be used in the course of reporting about environmental issues in Puerto Rico for the newsletter Heavy Weather: heavyweather.ghost.io. Documents retrieved from this request will be made available to the general public and the request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCarlos Berr\u00edos Polanco",
