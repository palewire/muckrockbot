All elected officials (including mayors, trustees, commissioners, and other elected and appointed officials).\r\n\r\n2. Immediate family members (including spouses, children, parents and other immediate relatives) of the officials listed above.\r\n\r\nFor each payment plan, I am requesting the following information:\r\n\r\nThe recipient\u2019s full name (unless prohibited by law, which I dispute as outlined below).\r\n\r\nThe address or account location related to the payment plan.\r\n\r\nThe total payment amount and schedule of payments associated with the payment plan.\r\n\r\nThe effective date of the payment plan and any records related to its approval.\r\n\r\nAll correspondence or documentation regarding how eligibility for the payment plan was determined.\r\n\r\nI understand that under FOIA (and related state public records laws), agencies may attempt to withhold or redact the names and addresses of individuals under the claim that such information is \"personal\" or \"private.\" However, I respectfully submit that in this case, such redactions would be inappropriate and contrary to the public interest.\r\n\r\nWhile private citizens generally have a reasonable expectation of privacy, public officials and their immediate family members do not share the same expectation when it comes to receiving public benefits or financial relief.\r\n\r\nThe information requested (names, addresses, and payment plans) does not expose sensitive private information like Social Security numbers, financial account numbers, or health data. Instead, it reveals details of how public resources are being allocated, which is precisely the type of information public records laws are designed to make accessible.\r\n\r\nPublic disclosure is essential to allow journalists, watchdog groups, and citizens to identify patterns of favoritism or special treatment for certain individuals or groups.\r\n\r\nNames and addresses are already found in public property records, voting rolls, and other public databases. If the recipient\u2019s name and address are already public in other contexts, redacting them here serves no meaningful privacy interest but instead obstructs accountability.\r\n\r\n*****If any portion of this request is denied or redacted, I ask that you provide the following:\r\n\r\n1. The specific legal exemption(s) being claimed for each redaction or denial.\r\n\r\n2. An explanation of how the exemption applies to the specific information being withheld.\r\n\r\n3. A list or index of withheld documents, as required under applicable \"Vaughn Index\" procedures.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Good morning,\r\nThank you for your public records request, attached above for your convenience. For the following reason, public records is unable to process this request at this time.\r\nIn Nebraska, the basic rule for open public records is set out in Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 84-712 (2014). That statute provides, in pertinent part, that \"all citizens of this state and all other persons interested in the examination of the public records...\" shall have the right to examine records in the possession of public agencies during normal agency business hours, to make memoranda and abstracts from those records, and to obtain copies of records in certain circumstances. The request we received for the records listed above came from MuckRock.com. It requires us to respond to MuckRock.com directly, i.e., either by email to MuckRock.com, upload responsive records to a MuckRock filesharing platform, or sent the responsive records by U.S. Mail addressed to \"MuckRock News\" in Boston, Massachusetts. However, MuckRock.com is neither a Nebraska citizen nor an interested person and, as a result, we do not consider this third-party request to be valid under the statute referenced above.\r\n\r\nAlthough no information was withheld as a result of this request due to the status of the requestor, public records provides the following appeal rights found in Neb. Rev., Stat. \u00a7 84-712.03. If you believe the withholding of information requested is in error, you have the right, pursuant to Nebraska Revised Statute \u00a7 84-712.03, to appeal the decision by filing for relief by a writ of mandamus in the District Court in Lancaster County, Nebraska or to petition the Nebraska Attorney General for review of this denial. For the purpose of an appeal, Thomas Skutt is the State official responsible for the decision to deny any portion of your request.\r\n\r\nNothing in this email shall be construed as a promise or guarantee, of any type, that public records responsive to your request exist or can be produced. If the public record exists, withholding or redaction may be required by applicable law.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nThomas Skutt, Jr., JD | Public Records and Discovery Attorney III\r\nLEGAL SERVICES\r\nNebraska Department of Health and Human Services\r\nOFFICE: 402-471-7020   |   FAX: 402-742-2374\r\nDHHS.ne.gov<http://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/default.aspx>  |  Facebook<https://www.facebook.com/NEDHHS/>  |  Twitter<https://twitter.com/NEDHHS>  |  LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/company/nebraska-department-of-health-and-human-services>\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This email message, including any attachments, is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

Please task a search that would yield UAP drone reports where the operator and origin has not been identified.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your timely cooperation and response. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 C.F.R 5.5(e), I respectfully request expedited processing. I provide the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746, declaring that they are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n\r\n1. Recent reports of UAP have created a subject of exceptional and widespread media interest about which there exists questions regarding the government\u2019s conduct..\r\nSee, e.g., and sources cited in paragraphs below.\r\n A. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/drone-sightings-spread-new-jersey-officials-express-outrage-federal-re-rcna184107 \r\n B. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drones-new-jersey-what-we-know/\r\n C. https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings/index.html\r\n D. https://apnews.com/article/fbi-drones-new-jersey-0f4aba00748ac464d42270fbe7457733\r\n E.  https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-we-know-about-the-mysterious-drones-flying-over-new-jersey\r\n F. https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/12/11/unexplained-reports-of-drones-flying-over-new-york-new-jersey-and-pennsylvania-heres-what-we-know/\r\n\r\n2. Beginning on or around November 18, 2024, multiple reports of UAP over the skies of New Jersey began to pour in. \r\n\r\n3. The UAP sightings occurred above one of the homes of the President-elect, and highly sensitive U.S. military installations, including the Picatinny Arsenal (see https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/decommissioning/complex/picatinny-arsenal.html). \r\n\r\n4. DHS is reportedly assisting in the federal coordination of the government\u2019s response to these UAP reports. https://defensescoop.com/2024/12/12/new-jersey-unidentified-drones-dod-poised-to-respond-if-threaten-military-assets/; https://apnews.com/article/fbi-drones-new-jersey-a978470fa3bb07ed3e98c5b7c18f0abb\r\n\r\n5. On December 13, DHS and FBI released a joint statement regarding this response: https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/12/12/joint-dhsfbi-statement-reports-drones-new-jersey. https://www.insidegovernmentcontracts.com/2024/01/implications-of-the-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-uap-amendment-in-the-2024-national-defense-authorization-act-ndaa/ \r\n\r\n6. To date, despite abundant video evidence, official confirmation from law enforcement and state officials, and federal lawmakers\u2019 questions, the government is unable to identify the origin, operator, or technological nature of the phenomena. https://www.npr.org/2024/12/11/nx-s1-5226000/new-jersey-drones.\r\n \r\n7. Instead, senior White House officials appear to dispute what people, including law enforcement officers, are witnessing and recording. https://www.twz.com/air/white-house-says-none-of-the-new-jersey-visual-drone-sightings-have-been-corroborated. \r\n\r\n8. Congress has held briefings on these phenomena; they produced no definitive answers from the U.S. government. https://ktxs.com/news/nation-world/pentagon-officials-hold-classified-briefing-with-congressn-uaps-ufos-new-jersey-sightings-drones-police-fbi-faa-regulations-bedminster-donald-trump-military-sites; https://thenationaldesk.com/news/americas-news-now/pentagon-officials-hold-classified-briefing-with-congressn-uaps-ufos-new-jersey-sightings-drones-police-fbi-faa-regulations-bedminster-donald-trump-military-sites\r\n\r\n9. In the absence of definitive, public assessments, elected officials are considering a limited declaration of emergency: https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/12/10/New-Jersey-Jon-Bramnick-drones-UAP-UFO-limited-emergency/9881733858673/. \r\n\r\n10.  Congress previously required collection of UAP records by no later than February 2024 in sections 1841-43of the FY23 National Defense Authorization Act\u2019s adaptation of the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023. https://www.insidegovernmentcontracts.com/2024/01/implications-of-the-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-uap-amendment-in-the-2024-national-defense-authorization-act-ndaa/.  \r\n\r\n11. The White House has declared the sightings are not attributable to a foreign nation. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/13/drones-over-new-jersey-white-house-lawmakers/76956011007/. \r\n\r\n12. Government officials, including DOD\u2019s Susan Gough, have stated that the UAP activity is not attributable to a U.S. research program. \r\n\r\n13. At least one U.S. Senator has called for U.S. military assets to shoot down these UAP, notwithstanding the publicly stated position of federal and state officials that they are not hostile, not experimental, and not identified. https://abc7ny.com/post/new-jersey-drones-us-senator-says-mystery-devices-spotted-nj-should-shot-down-necessary/15647143/. \r\n\r\n14. True to form, New Jersey residents have also suggested taking matters into their own hands and shooting down the phenomena as well. https://www.foxnews.com/us/drones-mystery-new-jersey-homeowners-threaten-take-matters-own-hands-govt-doesnt-act.\r\n\r\n15. In the absence of clear, consistent communications from U.S. officials, heightened tensions regarding the inability or unwillingness of the government to explain what is happening above the skies of New Jersey, there is an increasing risk to the health and safety of people who are making the reports and capturing the video images of whoever or whatever is visiting the Garden State.\r\n\r\n16. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Recent reports of UAP have created a subject of exceptional and widespread media interest about which there exists questions regarding the government\u2019s conduct..\r\nSee, e.g., and sources cited in paragraphs below.\r\n A. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/drone-sightings-spread-new-jersey-officials-express-outrage-federal-re-rcna184107 \r\n B. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drones-new-jersey-what-we-know/\r\n C. https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings/index.html\r\n D. https://apnews.com/article/fbi-drones-new-jersey-0f4aba00748ac464d42270fbe7457733\r\n E.  https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-we-know-about-the-mysterious-drones-flying-over-new-jersey\r\n F. https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/12/11/unexplained-reports-of-drones-flying-over-new-york-new-jersey-and-pennsylvania-heres-what-we-know/\r\n\r\n2. Beginning on or around November 18, 2024, multiple reports of UAP over the skies of New Jersey began to pour in. \r\n\r\n3. The UAP sightings occurred above one of the homes of the President-elect, and highly sensitive U.S. military installations, including the Picatinny Arsenal (see https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/decommissioning/complex/picatinny-arsenal.html). \r\n\r\n4. DHS is reportedly assisting in the federal coordination of the government\u2019s response to these UAP reports. https://defensescoop.com/2024/12/12/new-jersey-unidentified-drones-dod-poised-to-respond-if-threaten-military-assets/; https://apnews.com/article/fbi-drones-new-jersey-a978470fa3bb07ed3e98c5b7c18f0abb\r\n\r\n5. On December 13, DHS and FBI released a joint statement regarding this response: https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/12/12/joint-dhsfbi-statement-reports-drones-new-jersey. https://www.insidegovernmentcontracts.com/2024/01/implications-of-the-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-uap-amendment-in-the-2024-national-defense-authorization-act-ndaa/ \r\n\r\n6. To date, despite abundant video evidence, official confirmation from law enforcement and state officials, and federal lawmakers\u2019 questions, the government is unable to identify the origin, operator, or technological nature of the phenomena. https://www.npr.org/2024/12/11/nx-s1-5226000/new-jersey-drones.\r\n \r\n7. Instead, senior White House officials appear to dispute what people, including law enforcement officers, are witnessing and recording. https://www.twz.com/air/white-house-says-none-of-the-new-jersey-visual-drone-sightings-have-been-corroborated. \r\n\r\n8. Congress has held briefings on these phenomena; they produced no definitive answers from the U.S. government. https://ktxs.com/news/nation-world/pentagon-officials-hold-classified-briefing-with-congressn-uaps-ufos-new-jersey-sightings-drones-police-fbi-faa-regulations-bedminster-donald-trump-military-sites; https://thenationaldesk.com/news/americas-news-now/pentagon-officials-hold-classified-briefing-with-congressn-uaps-ufos-new-jersey-sightings-drones-police-fbi-faa-regulations-bedminster-donald-trump-military-sites\r\n\r\n9. In the absence of definitive, public assessments, elected officials are considering a limited declaration of emergency: https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/12/10/New-Jersey-Jon-Bramnick-drones-UAP-UFO-limited-emergency/9881733858673/. \r\n\r\n10.  Congress previously required collection of UAP records by no later than February 2024 in sections 1841-43of the FY23 National Defense Authorization Act\u2019s adaptation of the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023. https://www.insidegovernmentcontracts.com/2024/01/implications-of-the-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-uap-amendment-in-the-2024-national-defense-authorization-act-ndaa/.  \r\n\r\n11. The White House has declared the sightings are not attributable to a foreign nation. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/13/drones-over-new-jersey-white-house-lawmakers/76956011007/. \r\n\r\n12. Government officials, including DOD\u2019s Susan Gough, have stated that the UAP activity is not attributable to a U.S. research program. \r\n\r\n13. At least one U.S. Senator has called for U.S. military assets to shoot down these UAP, notwithstanding the publicly stated position of federal and state officials that they are not hostile, not experimental, and not identified. https://abc7ny.com/post/new-jersey-drones-us-senator-says-mystery-devices-spotted-nj-should-shot-down-necessary/15647143/. \r\n\r\n14. True to form, New Jersey residents have also suggested taking matters into their own hands and shooting down the phenomena as well. https://www.foxnews.com/us/drones-mystery-new-jersey-homeowners-threaten-take-matters-own-hands-govt-doesnt-act.\r\n\r\n15. In the absence of clear, consistent communications from U.S. officials, heightened tensions regarding the inability or unwillingness of the government to explain what is happening above the skies of New Jersey, there is an increasing risk to the health and safety of people who are making the reports and capturing the video images of whoever or whatever is visiting the Garden State.\r\n\r\n16. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Trump\u2019s first administration (January 20, 2017 \u2013 January 20, 2021), focusing on efforts to manage public and media perceptions of the administration:\r\n\r\n1. Internal Communications About Media Strategy\r\n\t\u2022\tEmails, memoranda, or other internal communications between OMB officials and White House staff discussing:\r\n\t\u2022\tMedia strategies to manage public perception of President Trump following controversial statements or actions.\r\n\t\u2022\tInstructions to federal agencies on how to align messaging with Trump\u2019s narrative, including framing him as a victim of \u201cfake news.\u201d\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), emphasizes FOIA\u2019s purpose to inform the public about government operations, particularly those involving media influence and public communication strategies.\r\n\r\n2. Communications with Media Outlets\r\n\t\u2022\tAll communications between OMB staff and representatives of media outlets (e.g., CNN, Fox News, New York Times, etc.), including:\r\n\t\u2022\tGuidance or suggestions regarding how Trump\u2019s public persona should be portrayed.\r\n\t\u2022\tReactions to specific media coverage of Trump or his administration.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 857 F. Supp. 2d 44 (D.D.C. 2012), highlights the public\u2019s right to understand government coordination with external entities, including the media.\r\n\r\n3. Press Interaction Planning\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords related to planning and execution of press interactions after controversial actions or statements, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tTalking points, briefing materials, or Q&A documents prepared for Trump or senior officials to address the press.\r\n\t\u2022\tMedia strategies specifically designed to counteract \u201cfake news\u201d narratives.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: In American Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011), the court affirmed FOIA\u2019s role in providing transparency on government strategies that influence public discourse.\r\n\r\n4. Instructions to Federal Agencies\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of directives, guidance, or policies sent by OMB to federal agencies about aligning public communications with Trump\u2019s media narrative, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tFraming Trump as a victim of media bias.\r\n\t\u2022\tStrategies for projecting strength and competence in response to critical media coverage.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), reinforces that records related to public-facing strategies are subject to disclosure under FOIA.\r\n\r\n5. Analysis or Reports on Media Coverage\r\n\t\u2022\tReports, summaries, or internal analyses compiled by OMB about media coverage of Trump and his administration, including assessments of how specific outlets covered controversies or key events.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146 (1989), supports FOIA\u2019s goal of exposing government analysis and efforts to shape public perception.\r\n\r\nRelevance to Public Interest\r\n\r\nThis request is of significant public interest, as the requested records would provide insight into how a sitting administration used government resources to influence media coverage, shape public perception, and project a carefully managed narrative. Public understanding of such efforts is critical to evaluating transparency and accountability in government.\r\n\r\nSegregability of Non-Exempt Portions\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the requested records is deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions, as required by Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). Agencies must provide detailed justifications for withheld information, including an exemption log.\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records\r\n\r\nPlease note your legal obligation to preserve all potentially responsive records. Any destruction of such records without proper justification constitutes a violation of FOIA\u2019s statutory requirements.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nAs an independent investigative journalist with Transparency Report, I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of the requested information serves the public interest by significantly enhancing public understanding of government operations during a historic presidency. This request is not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Cause of Action v. FTC, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015), supports the granting of fee waivers for requests that contribute to public understanding of significant governmental actions.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $200 for processing fees and request prior notification if costs exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), as this request pertains to an issue of significant and continuing public interest involving government accountability, media influence, and public perception of transparency.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records in electronic format where possible. As stipulated by FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days. If any part of this request is unclear, please contact me at Jordan@Lassiter.eu for clarification.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter",

Additionally, it includes any relevant metadata, logs, and supporting documentation.\r\n\r\nThe request also seeks access to after-action and pre-action reports prepared in connection with the events of January 6, 2021. Given the ongoing congressional hearings and investigations into these events, the records are critical to public interest, government accountability, and public safety.\r\n\r\n1. Text Message Communications\r\n\t\u2022\tAll text messages sent or received by U.S. Secret Service personnel, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tAgents assigned to President Trump\u2019s and Vice President Pence\u2019s security details.\r\n\t\u2022\tCommunications regarding Trump\u2019s potential movements, including plans or discussions about traveling to the Capitol.\r\n\t\u2022\tMessages discussing security threats to the Capitol, members of Congress, or Vice President Pence as the events unfolded.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), affirms the public\u2019s right to access records related to government accountability and transparency.\r\n\r\n2. Phone Call Metadata, Logs, and Wire Communications\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords of phone calls and wire communications made or received by Secret Service personnel, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tLogs and metadata (timestamps, durations, and recipients) for calls discussing security threats, coordination, and protective actions.\r\n\t\u2022\tCall summaries or notes related to Trump\u2019s potential travel to the Capitol or other significant movements.\r\n\t\u2022\tThis includes records of any encrypted or secure line communications.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Milner v.

U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 857 F. Supp. 2d 44 (D.D.C. 2012), highlights the need for transparency in interagency communications during critical events.\r\n\r\n4.

U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011), supports public access to government records documenting significant public safety events.\r\n\r\n5. After-Action and Pre-Action Reports\r\n\t\u2022\tAny after-action reports created by the U.S. Secret Service analyzing the events of January 6, 2021, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tSecurity lapses, failures, and vulnerabilities.\r\n\t\u2022\tAssessments of agent responses and decisions made during the insurrection.\r\n\t\u2022\tRecommendations for future operations or improvements.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny pre-action reports or assessments, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tPreparations for Trump\u2019s and Pence\u2019s security on January 6.\r\n\t\u2022\tThreat assessments or intelligence briefings regarding risks to Congress, the Capitol, or federal officials.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: These reports are critical for public accountability. John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146 (1989), highlights FOIA\u2019s intent to shed light on government operations.\r\n\r\n6. Deleted or Missing Records\r\n\t\u2022\tDocumentation regarding any deleted or missing records (e.g., text messages, emails, wire communications) related to January 6, 2021, including justifications or efforts to recover such records.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: FOIA\u2019s transparency principles, as reinforced by Vaughn v.

Interagency Communications\r\n\t\u2022\tAll communications between the Secret Service and other federal, state, or local agencies during the specified timeframe, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tFBI, Capitol Police, and Department of Defense communications.\r\n\t\u2022\tInteragency discussions about Trump\u2019s or Pence\u2019s security concerns.\r\n\t\u2022\tCollaborative updates or plans for managing the escalating events at the Capitol.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Interagency communications fall within FOIA\u2019s scope, as established in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Department of Energy, 412 F.3d 125 (D.C. Cir. 2005).\r\n\r\nRelevance to Public Interest\r\n\r\nThis request is of urgent public interest due to the ongoing congressional hearings, investigations, and widespread public concern regarding the January 6, 2021, events. The requested records pertain to national security, public safety, and the transparency of federal agency operations. As established in Al-Fayed v. CIA, 254 F.3d 300 (D.C. Cir. 2001), FOIA requests addressing compelling public interest deserve expedited processing.\r\n\r\nSegregability of Non-Exempt Portions\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the requested records is deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions, as required by Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). Agencies must provide detailed justifications for withheld information, including an exemption log.\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records\r\n\r\nPlease note your legal obligation to preserve all potentially responsive records. Any destruction of such records without proper justification constitutes a violation of FOIA\u2019s statutory requirements.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nAs an independent investigative journalist with Transparency Report, I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of the requested information serves the public interest by significantly enhancing public understanding of government operations during a historic and critical event. This request is not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Cause of Action v. FTC, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015), supports the granting of fee waivers for requests that contribute to public understanding of significant governmental actions.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $200 for processing fees and request prior notification if costs exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), as this request pertains to an issue of significant and continuing public interest involving national security, public safety, and government accountability.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records in electronic format where possible.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Department of State (DOS) records, documents, and communications responsive to Project Brain Wave, aka Operation Brain Wave. This was a program proposed and implemented by the DOS between 1950 and 1955. An undated memorandum sent by someone within the DOS to the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council states: \"10. 'Project Brain Wave'. The Department of State is developing and has reported to the Board a project designed to stimulate display of indigenous anti-Communist sentiment in the countries of Western Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThis memorandum is number 57 in a group of memos declassified by the DOS and can be found on page 109 of a document made accessible at: https://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/96783.pdf.\r\n\r\nAfter this memorandum was sent, someone associated with the Office of International Information and Educational Exchange Programs, Bureau of Public Affairs sent or received an undated draft memorandum, written at some point between January 1, 1951 and December 31, 1952, titled \"Implementation of Operation Brain Wave\".  This document, attached, states as follows: \"I recommend that steps be taken to form a private foundation or organization with an appropriate title, which would in effect be usable as a direct arm of the State Department, which could be used to channel ideas to, and which would on its own initiative promote projects consistent with our objectives in a given country; an organization so eminently respectable that, in the conduct of projects, even though supported financially by the Department of State, the hand of the Department need not appear at all. Such organization could recruit and send people to Europe for example to get Operation Brain Wave underway.\"\r\n\r\nThis draft memorandum can be found at the National Archives and Record Administration, Archives II, College Park, Maryland, and its catalog information can be found at: https://catalog.archives.gov/id/3857396.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Information about Project/Operation Brain Wave has been declassified previously, as shown in the two examples provided above, and additional information about this program might help clarify the role of the DOS in managing tensions during the Cold War. The attached draft memo which references the creation of a \"private foundation or organization\" later identifies this entity as a \"front organization.\" During the Cold War, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) established such an organization, the Congress for Cultural Freedom, and it carried out many of the same functions described in the draft memo. Clarifying any overlap between DOS and CIA activities can help historians, journalists, and lay scholars in better contextualizing the Cold War for the public.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to Pieter van der Hurk, aka Peter Hurkos (May 21, 1911 \u2013 June 1, 1988). Mr. Hurkos was a Dutch immigrant and psychic who maintained a public profile between the years of 1956 and 1988. During this period, he claimed to have extrasensory perception and that he used this ability to assist law enforcement on cases ranging from the arrest of Albert DeSalvo, aka the Boston Strangler, to Charles Manson. Mr. Hurkos was himself arrested by the FBI on February 9, 1964, for impersonation of an FBI agent; he was found guilty and fined $1,000.\r\n\r\nProof of death is not required as Mr. Hurkos's date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). As noted above, Mr. Hurkos was a public figure arrested for impersonating a federal agent. Records pertaining to this investigation and the government's handling of it, along with any of Mr. Hurkos's other activities, would be of public interest. \r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
