Research requires record content but not personal identifying information such as DOB and SSN.\r\n\r\n**This request serves academic research into government record retention practices and interstate mobility documentation.**\r\n\r\n**If records from the 1990s are no longer retained due to policy limitations, requesting available documentation from earliest retained period.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Fee waiver requested for academic research into government record-keeping practices and institutional transparency and reasons listed below.**\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJustin Kashuba",
