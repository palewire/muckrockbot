The CCN number for this accident is 24170107. I was present at the scene and, while not directly involved, I am seeking information and a narrative description on the incident to understand what occurred and to confirm the condition of the cyclist who was struck and the severity of the crash. I understand that certain details may be redacted due to privacy concerns, and I am requesting as much information as can be made available to a third party.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPatrik Adri\u00e1n Szigeti",
