The courts have been consistent that name, address, telephone number, and email addresses of public records requestors are NOT EXEMPT from disclosure. \r\n \r\n 1.\tYou have provided no exemption logs. Why are you redacting information? What exemptions are you claiming under the PRA?\r\n \r\n 2. You have transformed and modified these original records requested into new records with new filenames. You have created new records which was not requested. \r\n \r\n For instance, file \"LWSD-Muckrock_000163.pdf\" refers to a request including the following:\r\n \r\n \"Dear Mr. Boyd:\r\n \r\n Attached please find the records responsive for your May 11, 2015 request for:\r\n \r\n Access to and a copy of all data related to concussion incidents for high school athletes at all high schools in the district but at least Lake Washington High School for sports years 2004-2014. All data with columns related to date, sport, season, age, gender, days kept out, and any records associated with district recording related to the Lystedt Law CRCW.28A.600. 190.\"\r\n \r\n However no responsive records are attached. Another .pdf file in the installment does refer to concussion incident reports, however as a requestor I am not obligated to assume, guess, or infer that this file which was attached to a response to Mr. Bord's request, a file which you have extracted and renamed from the originally requested PRA response if it is in fact the original attachment. \r\n \r\n Additionally, missing  is Mr. Boyd's original public records request as well as others, however we are not given enough context to understand what is missing and what is not.\r\n\r\n3. What records does this \"installment 1\" represent? You provide no context, meanwhile Lake Washington School District has already provided multiple installments of records. This is certainly not \"Installment One.\" Please explain in detail. \r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records again as requested, unredacted or with the proper exemption logs and explanations of what records are being provided, what records are being withheld, and why. \r\n\r\n4. We understand that now the District is for the 4th time giving a new \"final\"  estimated completion date for this request as 02-28-2023 (modified from the original missed final estimated completion date of 07-15-2022 Originally Provided by the District on 11-21-21).\r\n\r\nThank you.",

This includes penalties against any type of medical facility, including nursing homes, hospitals, or other outpatient treatment facilities. Records should span between the year 2000 to present, or reach as far back as is readily available. There are certain essential fields necessary: name of facility, location (county, city), date of penalty announcement, and dollar amount of penalty. I'm not in need of the individual documents associated with these corrections, just the penalty data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJonathan Rudenberg, a citizen of Delaware, in coordination with Siobhan Standaert.",

I am emailing today to request a correction related to published documents on this MuckRack database site in reference to Medical Facility Enforcement Actions from the Department of Health and Social Services:   https://www.muckrock.com/foi/delaware-236/medical-facility-enforcement-actions-144993/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe published file, titled \"FOIA Request CMP's Imposed\" contains inaccurate information. DHSS regretfully provided incorrect information in response to the FOIA request that led to the publication of a excel file listing facilities fined by the Delaware Division of Health Care Quality. The Lorelton has not been subject to any fines or administrative penalties.  The reference to a 6/12/20 fine for Discharge/Refusal to Readmit was provided in error.  That penalty was voided and the Lorelton was not found to have engaged in any deficient practice.  We request that the file published on the site be replaced with the corrected document attached and the publication of this message in full.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJen Brestel\r\nDirector of Communications\r\n\r\nDelaware Department of Health and Social Services<http://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/index.html>\r\nHerman M.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. McCall,\r\n\r\nThis is in response to your Freedom of Information Act request (23-11470)\r\nregarding any and all photos of the Surveyor 5 lunar lander. Your request\r\nwas received by our office on December 7, 2022.  Your request was also sent\r\nto the Still Pictures Branch; their office will respond separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request consists of a stated topic rather than describing specific\r\ndocuments, and therefore is not reasonably specific enough for us to be in\r\na position to easily locate documents responsive to your request.  Although\r\nour facility holds records created by NASA, they are not described at a\r\nlevel that would reasonably lead us to a particular series that would\r\ninclude the photographs you seek.  We recommend browsing the series that\r\nmention Surveyor here: Search Results for Surveyor in RG 255.\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/search?q=Surveyor&recordGroupNumber=255&levelOfDescription=series>\r\nIf you find records of interest, please reach out to\r\nArchives2Reference@nara.gov for information relating to availability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may also be helpful to reach out to the Records Officer for NASA to\r\ndetermine if Surveyor photographs were accessioned to a particular National\r\nArchives facility.  In your request, we recommend asking for both transfer\r\nand accession numbers.  Here is their contact information:\r\n\r\nPatti Stockman\r\n\r\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\r\n\r\nMail Code AO\r\n\r\n300 E Street SW\r\n\r\nWashington, DC 20546-0001\r\n\r\npatti.stockman@nasa.gov\r\n\r\n202-358-4787\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may also want to contact the NASA History Division\r\n<https://history.nasa.gov/> and the JPL Archives\r\n<https://jpl-nasa.libguides.com/archives>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this response a denial under the Freedom of Information\r\nAct because we cannot determine without more specific information whether\r\nthe records you have requested exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have the right to file an administrative appeal in writing via regular\r\nU.S. mail or email.  Your appeal should be received within ninety (90)\r\ncalendar days from the date of this letter and it should explain why you\r\nbelieve this response does not meet the requirements of the Freedom of\r\nInformation Act.  Please address it to the Deputy Archivist of the United\r\nStates (ND), National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi\r\nRoad, College Park, Maryland 20740.  Both the letter and the envelope\r\nshould be clearly marked \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal.\u201d  You may also\r\nsubmit your appeal to FOIA@nara.gov also addressed to the Deputy Archivist.\r\nAll correspondence should reference your internal case tracking number\r\nnoted above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to your right to file an administrative appeal with the Deputy\r\nArchivist, you may seek assistance from our FOIA Public Liaison, Rebecca\r\nCalcagno. Contact information for the FOIA Public Liaison at the National\r\nArchives, Washington DC area is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccessioned Executive Branch Agency Records - Washington, DC Area\r\n\r\nFOIA Public Liaison:  Rebecca Calcagno\r\n\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500\r\n\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n\r\nTelephone:  301-837-3190\r\n\r\nEmail:  DC.foia.liaison@nara.gov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may also contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS),\r\nthe Federal FOIA Ombudsman\u2019s office, for assistance.

Specifically,\r\nyour request was a followup to 23-11470.  From the correspondence we\r\nreceived, we could not determine a new question. Your request was received\r\nby our office on August 9, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe response we previously sent is below.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request. If you are not satisfied\r\nwith our action on this request, your options for appeal and dispute\r\nresolution are outlined in the attached enclosure.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nCate Brennan\r\n\r\nSupervisory Archivist\r\n\r\nReference, Research Rooms, & Augmented Processing Branch (RR2R)\r\n\r\nNational Archives at College Park\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\r\nFrom: Jason Atkinson <jason.atkinson@nara.gov>\r\nDate: Monday, December 12, 2022 at 2:41:21\u202fPM UTC-5\r\nSubject: Re: [23-11470] Freedom of Information Act Request - Sherman McCall\r\nTo: 129869-54902340@requests.muckrock.com <\r\n129869-54902340@requests.muckrock.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mr. McCall,\r\n\r\nThis is in response to your Freedom of Information Act request (23-11470)\r\nregarding any and all photos of the Surveyor 5 lunar lander. Your request\r\nwas received by our office on December 7, 2022.  Your request was also sent\r\nto the Still Pictures Branch; their office will respond separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request consists of a stated topic rather than describing specific\r\ndocuments, and therefore is not reasonably specific enough for us to be in\r\na position to easily locate documents responsive to your request.  Although\r\nour facility holds records created by NASA, they are not described at a\r\nlevel that would reasonably lead us to a particular series that would\r\ninclude the photographs you seek.  We recommend browsing the series that\r\nmention Surveyor here: Search Results for Surveyor in RG 255.\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/search?q=Surveyor&recordGroupNumber=255&levelOfDescription=series>\r\nIf you find records of interest, please reach out to\r\nArchives2Reference@nara.gov for information relating to availability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may also be helpful to reach out to the Records Officer for NASA to\r\ndetermine if Surveyor photographs were accessioned to a particular National\r\nArchives facility.  In your request, we recommend asking for both transfer\r\nand accession numbers.  Here is their contact information:\r\n\r\nPatti Stockman\r\n\r\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\r\n\r\nMail Code AO\r\n\r\n300 E Street SW\r\n\r\nWashington, DC 20546-0001\r\n\r\npatti.stockman@nasa.gov\r\n\r\n202-358-4787\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may also want to contact the NASA History Division\r\n<https://history.nasa.gov/> and the JPL Archives\r\n<https://jpl-nasa.libguides.com/archives>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this response a denial under the Freedom of Information\r\nAct because we cannot determine without more specific information whether\r\nthe records you have requested exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have the right to file an administrative appeal in writing via regular\r\nU.S. mail or email.  Your appeal should be received within ninety (90)\r\ncalendar days from the date of this letter and it should explain why you\r\nbelieve this response does not meet the requirements of the Freedom of\r\nInformation Act.  Please address it to the Deputy Archivist of the United\r\nStates (ND), National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi\r\nRoad, College Park, Maryland 20740.  Both the letter and the envelope\r\nshould be clearly marked \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal.\u201d  You may also\r\nsubmit your appeal to FOIA@nara.gov also addressed to the Deputy Archivist.\r\nAll correspondence should reference your internal case tracking number\r\nnoted above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to your right to file an administrative appeal with the Deputy\r\nArchivist, you may seek assistance from our FOIA Public Liaison, Rebecca\r\nCalcagno. Contact information for the FOIA Public Liaison at the National\r\nArchives, Washington DC area is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccessioned Executive Branch Agency Records - Washington, DC Area\r\n\r\nFOIA Public Liaison:  Rebecca Calcagno\r\n\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500\r\n\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n\r\nTelephone:  301-837-3190\r\n\r\nEmail:  DC.foia.liaison@nara.gov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may also contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS),\r\nthe Federal FOIA Ombudsman\u2019s office, for assistance.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    A copy of file 62-116931\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear Kevin Hawkins: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P042984-081523.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G.

Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Amory Houghton Jr.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.520, the District estimates that it may be able to provide you with documents responsive to your request within ninety (90) business days (June 8, 2023).\r\n\r\nThe district will locate and assemble the information requested, notify third persons or agencies affected by the request if applicable, and/or to determine whether any of the information contained in such documents is exempt from public disclosure.\r\n\r\nIf additional clarification is needed, we will respond as quickly as questions arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n****This is a massive request. I will need time to review the records and provide a cost estimate.\r\nEven once I provide the cost estimate, and you pay the deposit, this request will take a significant amount of time to produce as all records will have to be reviewed and redacted. When I provide the cost estimate I will also provide an updated time estimate.  This request will require multiple installments.  I will provide a cost and updated time estimate by February 17, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo view the procedure and costs associated with Public Records click Board Policy 4040P<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q0g-_-8x8bM__8Wuj8NkR1x7R5XMUMDU> . Below is a brief summary of potential fees:\r\n\r\n  *   Photocopies or printed copies .15 cents per page\r\n  *   Electronic records .10 cents per page for records scanned to an electronic format\r\n  *   Five cents per every 4 electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery\r\n  *   Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically\r\n  *   Actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n  *   The District may charge a flat fee of up to two dollars for any request as an alternative to fees when the agency reasonably estimates and documents that the cost allowed under this subsection are clearly equal to or more than two dollars.\r\n  *   A customized service charge may be imposed if the District estimates that the request would require the use of information technology expertise to prepare data compilations, or to provide customized electronic access services when such compilations and customized access services are not used by the District for other District purposes. The customized service charge may reimburse the District up to the actual cost of providing the services.\r\n  *   The District may choose to not calculate the actual costs it charges for providing public records if doing so would be unduly burdensome.\r\n  *   The District may waive any charge assess for a request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf requested, the District will provide a summary of the applicable charges before fulfilling the request. The requestor will be allowed to revise the request in order to reduce the applicable charges. A deposit of up to ten percent of the estimated costs may be required before processing the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above timeframes are simply estimates and processing your request may take longer than predicted.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\n\"On February 16, 2023, I requested a response from you by March 9, 2023, regarding the fee notification and payment.\r\n\r\nOn February 17, 2023, I received a response to my February 16, 2023, email, asking for the status of the request. I informed you that I sent the fee notification the day before, and you were in fact, replying to that detailed email regarding the fees and notes regarding your request. I have not heard back from you. I have had no communication from you on this request since February 16, 2023.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe fee estimate of $14.46 included multiple notes. In 2022, we had the same request from approximately 70 people, so the response documents sent to you would be duplicated by seventy. I\u2019m not sure you want that information.  Also, many of the requests were from MuckRock, with responsive materials that you already received. Please review the fee estimate and the four (4) notes listed below in this email string to make sure we provide you the records you desire.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Please confirm that you would like the district to move forward with your records request or if you would like to revise your request. I will start processing your request once I receive payment. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt any time that you no longer need the requested information in your public records request, please let me know.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District requires a ten-percent (10%) deposit on all public records requests.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPayment Instructions\r\n\r\nPayment can be made online.

Your email asked about the status of the response documents and noted that I had told you that the job would be completed by March 9, 2023.

That cost estimate included four (4) important notes that would have changed your fee. I did not hear back from you.\r\n  *   I replied to your email on February 17, 2023, asking for an update and I referred you to the fee estimate sent the previous day, which was included in your email string. I also asked you to take careful consideration with the notes regarding the types of requests that are included in this request. I stated you might want to revise your request.\r\n  *   The March 9, 2023, date you are referring to was the first deadline for payment.\r\n  *   On March 10, 2023, I send the 2nd notice of fee notification and included details about the 70 requesters that all received the same documents, and the many requests from MuckRock that you have already received. I received no response from you.\r\n  *   On March 23, 2023, we received the payment of the full $14.46.\r\n\r\nSince you have not communicated with me, I will assume that you want all materials, including all the previously provided MuckRock requests, and the many, many duplicated response documents.\r\n\r\nThe District is still able to provide the response documents by the originally quoted time estimate of June 8, 2023.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRevised request 03/30/23: Excluded multiple MuckRock requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**The third, fourth, and fifth installments on your public records request are available.\r\n\r\nThe reason I broke them up into individual installments is due to the number of records. I thought it would be easier to view in smaller chunks of files.\r\n\r\nThe remaining public records request that will be provided are all parent/student records and will need to be reviewed and redacted. I am not able to provide all documents by the originally estimated date of June 8, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new completion estimate is now September 20, 2023. I will do my best to complete this request as quickly as possible. I anticipate at least 2-3 installments remain.\r\n\r\nThe next installment will be provided by June 28, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe district uses SharePoint to deliver response documents.\r\nYour documents are stored in a SharePoint folder.  I have just shared that folder with you.\r\n\r\nYou will receive an email directly from SharePoint to the folder with your files.\r\nYou will then go through a short process to get an access code from SharePoint. That code will come in a second email from SharePoint to you.  If you do not receive the email right away, please check your spam folder.\r\n\r\n**Please review your documents within thirty (30) days. Per RCW 42.56.120(4), if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have trouble or if you have additional questions.\r\n\r\nAt any time that you no longer need the requested information in your public records request, please let me know. I will provide an update or the next installment on or before June 28, 2023.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLisa Connors\r\nPublic Records and Compliance Coordinator\r\nAuburn School District\r\n\r\nD: 253-887-3955\r\nP: 253-931-4900\r\nE: lconnors@auburn.wednet.edu<mailto:lconnors@auburn.wednet.edu>\r\n915 4th Street NE, Auburn, WA 98002\r\nwww.auburn.wednet.edu<http://www.auburn.wednet.edu/>",

This request has been temporarily placed on hold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs written, the request is too broad and would be unduly burdensome on the agency to process. \"[A]n agency need not respond to a request that is so broad as to impose an unreasonable burden upon the agency, such as one which requires the agency to locate, review, redact, and arrange for inspection a vast quantity of material.\" See Serv. Women's Action Network v. Dep't of Def., 888 F. Supp. 2d 282, 290 (D. Conn. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Halpern v. F.B.I., 181 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir. 1999) (\"[A]n agency need not conduct a search that plainly is unduly burdensome.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe invite you to narrow the scope of your FOIA request. To avoid the closing of your FOIA request, we ask that you please respond to this message within 10 days. Please note, the closing of your request will not prohibit you from submitting requests in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to schedule a meeting to discuss, please respond to this message when proposed date and times for next week.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

It has been over 6 weeks now. Please advise as to the status of this request. Thank you.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nOlympia School District\r\nWashington Public Records Act Office\r\n111 Bethel Street NE\r\nOlympia, WA 98506\r\n\r\nDecember 1, 2022\r\n\r\nOLYMPIA SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 (2020) Request for a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the District including the District Responses for the year 2020\r\n\r\nVia email: dcrawford@osd.wednet.edu\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2020 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2020.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2020 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management, access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health.\r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly\r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights\r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

I am\r\nrequesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health\r\nservice delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to\r\ninform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health\r\ncare delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically,\r\nI request information regarding the following:\r\n\r\n*1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and\r\nbehavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are\r\nincarcerated within your jurisdiction.*\r\n\r\n*2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of\r\nhealth and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within\r\nyour jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement,\r\nmedication management, access to specialist and dental services, discharge\r\nplanning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.*\r\n\r\n*3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled\r\nbetween your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical\r\nhealth and behavioral health.*\r\n\r\n*4. Records concerning your jurisdiction's most recent application to\r\nCentre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if\r\napplicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether\r\nsuch a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained\r\njuveniles.*\r\n\r\n*5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care\r\ndelivery in your jurisdiction.*\r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for\r\nsearching or copying these records, please inform me, However, I would also\r\nlike to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the\r\nrequested information is in the public interest and will contribute\r\nsignificantly to the public's understanding of the administration of\r\njuvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by\r\nstatute, please contact me with information about when I might expect\r\ncopies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption\r\nyou feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of\r\nthe appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request, Sincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly\r\n\r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights\r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\n\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives Citizens for Juvenile Justice 617.338.1050\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems\r\nhere: https://www.muckrock.com/respond/1526258/\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\n\r\nRYUGMG!Vij\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock,com E-mail (Preferred):\r\n147330-41053673@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\n\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\n\r\nMuckRock News DEPT MR 147330\r\n\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\n\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is\r\nbeing sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share,\r\nand manage public records requests.

If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "SHORELINE SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 School Resource Officer Program / School Safety and Security Staff Program / School District Law Enforcement Contracts and Agreements for the Years 2019-2022.\r\n\r\nVia email: public.records@shorelineschools.org\r\n\r\nGOOD MORNING!\r\n\r\nTo whom it may concern,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON STATE OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION - EQUITY AND CIVIL RIGHTS (https://www.k12.wa.us/policy-funding/equity-and-civil-rights):\r\n\r\n\"The Washington State legislature notes that schools should be a place in which all youth feel safe. With racial equity as a central component of safety and security planning, it is imperative that all school safety and security staff not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.\"\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.\tProvide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3.\tProvide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nNote: If your agency chooses not to produce the requested records in reverse chronological order as requested, and/or chooses to sandbag this request by dribbling out a few records per installment every 6 months (tee-hee), you can expect a separate targeted public records request for each line item by year - submitted via multiple members of the public, multiple times until the requested records are timely produced. This simple three part multi year request would then become twelve (12) separate public records requests. If your agency would prefer 12 separate individual requests, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",
