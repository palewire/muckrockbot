All records regarding repairs, vandalism, sabotage and payments made in connection to Ana L. Toledo\u2019s vehicles.\r\n\r\n21. Any other document in your possession or that of a third party that you know of that relates to Ana L. Toledo or her property.\r\n\r\n22. All reports,, emails, text messages, recordings, videos, images or any other kind of record regarding the monitoring of Ana L. Toledo's Former Twitter/Now X accounts under the handles @anatoledodavila and @realhitomi, including monitoring logs, correspondence, emails and communications to and from Twitter/X.\r\n\r\nAs you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\n\r\nFor any document you know exists but do not have, please provide name of agency and contact information to request it from.\r\n\r\nIII. Expedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nThe undersigned publishes a newsletter in anatoledo.substack.com and X articles under the handle @anatoledodavila. She currently has over 7,000 subscribers in both platforms and over 40,000 views per month. Pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466, she qualifies as a member of the news media that provides information of public interest to her subscribers. Thus the information sought is not deemed for commercial use. Id. Her status as a member of the media warrants the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed in the endeavors of disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5 (d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nThe records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity.\u201d Id.\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, the undersigned requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nIV. Request for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nThe undersigned hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2). Furthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as the undersigned will report the results of this endeavor as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, I request that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F. 2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). \r\n\r\nThe Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 832-247-3046. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nAna L. Toledo, Esq.\t\r\nanaluda@proton.me\r\nT. 832-24-3047\r\nPO Box 15990\r\nHouston, TX 77220\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

While participating remotely by phone, Ms. Adams stated:\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me just start by saying a real big thank you to our staff and our administration\u2026 last week we had a little bit more excitement in one week than we would like to have at the school\u2026 In this world of communication right now we need to remember that information will be dispelled as it\u2019s necessary and available, and that doesn\u2019t always mean, you know, right this second.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis statement appears to acknowledge a deliberate delay in communication with families regarding a specific incident or emergency. Notably, no other board member acknowledged the comment, and no one else referred to the incident at any point during the meeting. The session continued without clarification, follow-up, or public discussion\u2014despite the implications of the remark.\r\n\r\nFor reference, I am including a brief excerpt from the publicly available recording of the meeting:\r\nhttps://archive.org/download/spusd_02-11-2025/spusd_02-11-2025.mp4\r\n\r\nThe clip has been lightly zoomed to highlight board member reactions at the moment the comment was made. The fact that a board member raised a potentially serious issue\u2014publicly, on record\u2014and was met with complete silence, including from colleagues physically present in the room, is relevant context for this request.\r\n\r\nThis statement\u2014and the collective non-response that followed\u2014raises serious questions about what was known internally, when key decisions were made, and how communication with the public was managed at both the administrative and board level.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Rochford",

A FOIA response posted on another Virginia Government site indicates that VMI received $3,832,025 in 2024 and $398,250 in 2025, totaling $4,230,275 under the Pell Initiative for Virginia (PIV). In Maj. Gen. Wins' public statement after the VMI BOV voted not to extend his contract, he identified this funding as one of his significant accomplishments, although he did not mention the Virginia Program by Name. The Virginia public records show VMI reported expending approximately $55,000 to payoff the outstanding tuition bills for some cadets (\"VMI requests $55,000 to support the payment of past-due and summer balances\"). I am requesting records showing the racial, ethnic and gender breakdown of those cadets.\r\n\r\n4. Also from other Virginia documents:\r\n\r\na. \"faculty stipends to provide oversight for additional Group Study Sessions (GSS).\" - who received the stipends and what events did the oversee (by name) for all rounds of the grant\r\nb. \"Establish a CAARE Team at VMI.\" - Who are the members, and what is the team's mission? for all rounds of the grant\r\nc.  \"Financial aid to Pell eligible Virginians\" - I am requesting records showing the racial, ethnic and gender breakdown of those cadets for all rounds of the grant\r\nd. \"Application Fee Waivers\" - I am requesting records showing the racial, ethnic and gender breakdown of those cadets for all rounds of the grant\r\ne. \"MAC-Sponsored study events\" - what were these events, who conducted them, and any information on what the events covered as well as a cost breakbdown by event for all rounds of the grant.\r\nf. STP Scholarships -  I am requesting records showing the racial, ethnic and gender breakdown of those cadets for all rounds of the grant.\r\ng. Targeted Name Purchase - records describing what this product or service is for all rounds of the grant.\r\n\r\nFor any funds paid to outside entities, the name of those entities, the amounts paid to them, and the services for which they were paid.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Documentation of my contact with the State Department circa 2002-2003 regarding my request for assistance with international child welfare concerns\r\n\r\n2. Copy of the Department's response letter sent to me in 2004 providing Hague Convention information and procedures\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: Following my child's extended absence from the United States when taken by his mother and grandmother to Kilmarnock, Scotland in July 2002 - an area known for high crime rates and drug activity - I contacted the State Department seeking guidance on Hague Convention procedures for legally securing my child's return to the United States. The prolonged international absence in this location created significant concerns about my child's welfare, safety, and unknown living conditions. The Department appropriately and professionally responded with educational information about Hague Convention processes and international child welfare protections.\r\n\r\nThis request serves family documentation purposes and focuses specifically on the initial request for assistance and the Department's professional and comprehensive response providing legal guidance.\r\n\r\nFee waiver requested for personal correspondence records and family documentation research.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Thus the information sought is not deemed for commercial use. Id. TJ's status as a member of the media warrants the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed in the endeavors of disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5 (d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nThe records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity.\u201d Id.\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, TJ requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2). Furthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as the TJ will report the results of this endeavor as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\n For any document you fail to produce, TJ requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F. 2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at (phone number). Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nTargeted Justice\r\n281-772-2668\r\n247tj@proton.me\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice",

Specifically, the policies, regulations, furloughs, passes, excusal from military duties, classes, and other accommodations provided Cadets so they can participate in religious and ethnic observances in meeting the Chaplain Office's Missions to: 1.  Ensure free exercise of religion; and 2) Provide pastoral care regardless of religious affiliation. This request pertains to the academic years listed below. These include, without limitation, the policy and another process for cadets to take a week off (or other periods) to celebrate Ramadan, time off  and other accomodations for for Major religious holidays include those celebrated by Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and others (e.g. Christmas, Easter, Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, Yom Kippur, Diwali, etc.)\r\n\r\nAcademic Years Covered:\r\n2023 - 2024\r\n2024 - 2025\r\n\r\nWhile I understand the schedules of these events and the guidance in terms of \"orders\" or other instructions allowing cadets to take advantage of absences from the campus, classes are more likely than not internal records, if any of these policies are publicly posted I am willing to accept links to them so they do not have to be converted to files and sent and so reduce the workload required to fill this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Connecticut Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDear Derby Police Department,\r\n\r\nRequesting any records, documents, and photographs related to Police Officer Thomas (Tommy) J. Kashuba, D.O.B. November 28 1936, who served with the Derby Police Department for approximately 20 years. As his grandson conducting family genealogical research, I am seeking to document his law enforcement career and preserve his service legacy.\r\nThis request continues my family genealogical research following my recent request for my grandfather's military service records through NPRC. I am seeking to document his complete public service career spanning both Army and police service. Due to family circumstances that led to my relocation from Connecticut in 1994, I have very limited family documentation of his career.\r\nRecords requested include:\r\n\r\n-Personnel files and employment documentation\r\n-Commendations, awards, and recognition records\r\n-Photographs, official portraits, department photos, ceremonies\r\n-Community service and public safety contributions\r\n-Retirement or end-of-service documentation\r\n-Funeral arrangements and Honor Guard ceremony records\r\n-Military honors coordination documentation\r\n\r\nFamily Background: I was named after my grandfather (middle name Thomas), reflecting our close relationship before his passing when I was 11 years old. I still remember seeing grandpa Tommy on his beat which was near the Derby Green at that time. He seemed to know everyone in town and treated everyone with the same respect. In 1988 Tommy was struck with a sudden heart attack near Derby High School while off duty and died that night at Griffon Hospital. I was outside the room when he passed. Grandpa Tommy meant a lot to me. My own son is named Justin Thomas Kashuba II. We have very limited family documentation of his police service and am seeking to preserve his law enforcement legacy. He reportedly was involved in notable cases including at least one high-profile arrest during his career. \r\n\r\nAdditional Service Honors: My grandfather received a police burial with Honor Guard and military funeral honors provided by U.S. Army personnel, reflecting his distinguished service in both military and law enforcement careers. My son and I would greatly appreciate any records related to his funeral arrangements, Honor Guard participation, military honors coordination, and ceremony documentation that may have been maintained by the department.\r\n\r\nGENEALOGICAL PURPOSE: This request serves family heritage preservation and honors his dedication to public service possibly spanning 40 years combined military and law enforcement career.\r\nFee waiver requested for family genealogical research and public servant legacy preservation.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to express in words what my grandfather Tommy meant to me. If I missed any records that you feel are appropriate please provide them at your discretion.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJustin Kashuba",
