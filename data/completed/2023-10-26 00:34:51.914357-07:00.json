        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. If you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-338-1050 or by email at Erinstewart@cfjj.org. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Stewart\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nATTENTION:\r\n\r\nThe Government Spying Transparency Project (GSTP) submit this expedited Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request for records of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI') pertaining to the investigation and surveillance of Muslim communities in Washington. The GSTP submit this request pursuant to the FOIA, 5 U.S.C.  \u00a7 552, implementing regulations 8 C.F.R.  \u00a7 103.10 and 6 C.F.R.  \u00a7 5 and any other applicable regulations.\r\n\r\nCommunity members, civil rights organizations, and mainstream media have reported that the FBI is surveilling and infiltrating Muslim American communities and building a dragnet that is detrimentally affecting the lives of innocent Americans. We have seen FBI spying exposed in communities in Northern California, New York and Minnesota. Muslims in Oregon routinely report being harassed and followed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We\u2019ve seen the leaks of former FBI Agent Terry Albury who exposed wide-spread unwarranted and unconstitutional surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation across the country and a culture of Islamophobia within the bureau. Former FBI Agent Terry Albury said the Federal Bureau of Investigation routinely targeted innocent and vulnerable Muslim Americans and said the Federal Bureau of Investigation ruined lives.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR INFORMATION:\r\n\r\nWe are seeking disclosure of agency records in your possession that fall within the following areas:\r\n\r\n(1)  Individual records related to FBI activities in Washington from September 11, 2001, to the present pertaining to:\r\n       \r\n      a.  FBI investigations and assessments of mosques; Islamic centers; Muslim community centers; Muslim organizations; members of mosques, Islamic centers, or Muslim community centers based on their membership or affiliation with such centers; Muslim leaders; and imams;\r\n      b.  Domain management, including but not limited to maps or other records relating to or describing \"domains;\" and records of\"concentrated ethnic communities,\" \"ethnic-oriented businesses or nonprofits\" and any other records related to \"community race and ethnicity\" analyses or assessments in the FBI \"domains\" of Washington. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\n\r\nTitle 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) provides for expedited processing of requests for information in cases in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need. By statute, for requests made by persons primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal government activity constitutes a \"compelling need.\"\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(Il). In addition, Department of Justice regulations states that FOIA requests are entitled to expedited processing when the information requested involves \"(a] matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.S(d)(l)(iv). Here, the requesters of this information are primarily engaged in disseminating information and, for reasons made clear below, there is an urgency to inform the public concerning federal government activity in connection with the FBl's investigation of Muslim communities.8 FBI activities that the instant FOIA request is intended to reveal have been widely reported, caused widespread anxiety, and raised widespread concerns about the federal government's misconduct, including racial and religious profiling and violations of the constitutional rights of United States residents, both aliens and citizens. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR WAIVER OF PROCESSING FEES UNDER FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT BECAUSE DISCLOSURE OF THE REQUESTED INFORMATION IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.\r\n\r\nWe also request a fee waiver for duplication costs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(ii)(ll)-(iii). Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. It will further public understanding of government conduct, in particular the FBl's policies, practices, and methods of surveillance including the use of informants, the use of informants in terrorism-related prosecutions, the rate at which investigations and assessments of Muslim communities result in criminal and other prosecutions. We are well situated to disseminate information gained through this request to the public, to affected communities, to organizations that protect immigrants' rights, and to political and religious organizations. If the fee waivers are denied, the requesters are prepared to pay fees up to $25, and request to be informed of further fees that may be charged, but reserve the right to appeal a denial of fee waivers. If this request for information is denied in whole or in part, we ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. We expect you to release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. We reserve the right to appeal a decision to withhold any information.\r\n\r\nBROAD INTERPRETATION OF REQUEST.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request should be interpreted to include records maintained by FBI headquarters or any field office or task force including the Seattle FBI Field Office, Washington Joint Terrorism Task Forces, and U.S. / National Joint Terrorism Task Force but not limited to such.\r\n\r\nI affirm that the information provided supporting the request for expedited processing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJustin Acta",

Here, the requesters of this information are primarily\r\n    engaged in disseminating information and, for reasons made clear below,\r\n    there is an urgency to inform the public concerning federal government\r\n    activity in connection with the FBl's investigation of Muslim communities.8\r\n    FBI activities that the instant FOIA request is intended to reveal have been\r\n    widely reported, caused widespread anxiety, and raised widespread concerns\r\n    about the federal government's misconduct, including racial and religious\r\n    profiling and violations of the constitutional rights of United States\r\n    residents, both aliens and citizens.\r\n\r\n** \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress. Questions regarding your FOIA request may be directed to\r\nfoipaquestions@fbi.gov. If you have received a FOIPA request number, please\r\ninclude this in all correspondence concerning your request. Please note eFOIPA\r\nrequests are processed in the order that they are received. If you have not\r\nreceived a FOIPA request number, your request is in the process of being\r\nopened at which time it will be assigned a FOIPA request number and\r\ncorrespondence will be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n** \r\n\r\nUpon receipt of your FOIPA request number, you may check the status of your\r\nFOIPA request on the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electronic FOIA Library (The Vault) on the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\r\npublic website, http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCheck Status of Your\r\nFOI/PA Request tool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 link.

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact FOIA/PA Unit representative Fantasia L. Hogan-Bassey-Graham at (571) 776-2210 or via e-mail at Fantasia.L.Hogan-Bassey-Graham@dea.gov, our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public.\u00a0 You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

        "communication": "Dear William Fernandes:\r\n\u200b\r\n            This e-mail responds to your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) request dated April 2, 2022, received by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), FOIA/PA Unit, seeking access to DEA records.  Your request has been opened and assigned the following case number: 23-00303-F.  Please include this case number when communicating with this office.\r\n\r\nYour request as written does not meet the requirements of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(3)(A), since they do not reasonably describe records.  The Department of Justice rules, contained at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.3, provide that \u201cyou must describe the records in enough detail to enable department personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort\u201d and when possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought such as the date, title or name, author and subject matter of the record.  These specifics are important to determine the extent and scope of the search, and to determine the records that are responsive.  DEA can make certain presumptions to overcome some of the deficiencies in your request, but not all of them.\r\n\r\nTo retrieve the information that you may be seeking requires more specificity.  Under the FOIA, an agency is not required to conduct research.  DEA maintains several types of records and records systems (i.e., regulatory, personnel, investigative, etc.).  For example, in your letter, you are requesting Any and all expense records for travel into the State of Nevada for the period 2020.,\u201d yet you have not specified a particular DEA office that you wish searched; or the type of record that would be responsive to your request.  Be advised that DEA has 239 Domestic Offices in 23 Divisions throughout the United States, and 92 foreign offices in 69 countries, and more than 150 Headquarters Offices.  Since your description did not limit the search to a specific office or area, a vast majority of DEA offices would be tasked to conduct a search of their respective offices for any responsive records pertaining to the subject of your request.  As such, your request is overly broad and burdensome.\r\n\r\nPlease specify the following:\r\n\r\n  1.  Clarify the type of travel (TDY and/or Extended TDY travel)\r\n  2.  Verify the timeframe for \u201c2020\u201d (calendar year Jan-December or fiscal year Oct 2019 \u2013 Sept 2020)\r\n  3.  Do you also want the information to include the PCS travel when core employees move?\r\n\r\nTo this end, no further action will be initiated on this request until we are in receipt of the above documentation.  Upon receipt, we will conduct a query of the Investigative Reporting and Filing System (IRFS).  IRFS is the system of records that contains all administrative, general and investigative files compiled by DEA for law enforcement purposes.  If this office does not receive your response within 30 business days, DEA will assume that you do not wish to pursue this matter and your request will be administratively closed.  Please e-mail your response to fantasia.l.hogan-bassey-graham@dea.gov<mailto:fantasia.l.hogan-bassey-graham@dea.gov>.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with DEA\u2019s determination in response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website:  https://www.justice.gov/oip/submit-and-track-request-or-appeal.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request.  If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal.\"\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this email, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 853 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,786 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,500 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

His date of birth listed on Wikipedia is May 22, 1942. \r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of all US Marshals Service systems of records; these systems may include (but are not limited to) the Internal Affairs System; U.S. Marshals Service Prisoner Processing and Population Management-Prisoner Tracking System; Warrant Information Network (WIN); Witness Security Files Information System; and Inappropriate Communications-Threat Information System.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that USMS has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nKaczynski is widely reported to have died 6/10/2023 in ADX Florence (see attached article from the Associated Press). Records concerning Kaczynski as a subject should be presumed exempt from the FOIA Exemption 6, 7(C) and the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nT. McElwee",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMacKenzie Orcutt",

        "communication": "Dear Department of Public Works ,\r\n\r\nThis is a new Immediate Disclosure Request under the San Francisco Sunshine Ordinance, made before start of business August 22, 2019. \r\n\r\n** Please redact your responses correctly! This is a public mailbox, and all of your responses (including emails, attachments, file shares, and the disclosed records) may be automatically and instantly available to the general public on the MuckRock.com service used to issue this request (though I am not a MuckRock representative). Once you send them to us, there's no going back. **\r\n\r\nThe audio record of the August 7 SOTF meeting appears to reference a \"Custodian of Records Working Group\" (aka \"Custodian Working Group\", called the \"Group\" below) of public employees attempting to, among other things, lobby (in a colloquial sense), via a letter, the SOTF to impose certain suggestions or restrictions on the behavior of the public.  Perhaps my impression is incorrect; I would like to know more.\r\n\r\nI request under the San Francisco Sunshine Ordinance (Ordinance) and the California Public Records Act (CPRA):\r\n\r\n1. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all agendas (draft or final) of meetings of the Group\r\n2. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all minutes (draft or final) of meetings of the Group\r\n3. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all listings of the membership/roster of the Group\r\n4. regular request: all supporting documentation used at meetings of the Group\r\n5. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all records showing any budget allocations or other financial support given to the Group\r\n6. regular request: all records that would demonstrate the public monies being used to support the activities of the Group (including showing the time spent by public employees performing Group work, for example calendar/schedule items showing when the meetings took place and who attended).  Ms. Blackman said [in the Aug 7 SOTF audio record] that the signers spent \"quite a lot of time\" was spent writing this letter.  Provide all records showing what public employee work time was spent writing this letter.\r\n7. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all records related to the attempt to lobby the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force to change their rules or procedures, including but not limited to the letter discussed at the SOTF Aug 7 meeting.  Including a copy of the letter and all drafts or other versions of this letter.\r\n8. regular request: all correspondence between your Compliance Officer and/or Custodian of Records and/or Public Records Manager and the Group as an entity\r\n9. regular request: all correspondence between your Compliance Officer and/or Custodian of Records and/or Public Records Manager and any of { David Steinberg, Sue Blackman, Hank Heckel, Caroline Celaya, Marianne Mazzucco-Thompson } since Jan. 1, 2019.\r\n10. regular request: Ms. Celaya stated [in the Aug 7 SOTF audio record] that certain best practices have been generated.  Provide all policies/best practices written by the Group.\r\n\r\nWe remind you of your obligations to provide electronic records in any format we request them in, as long as either you hold them in that format, the format is available to you, or the format is easy to generate (Admin Code 67.21(l)). Therefore, calendars exported in the .ics, iCalendar, or vCard formats (\"A\") and emails exported in the .eml or .msg formats (\"B\") with all non-exempt headers, metadata, attachments, etc. are our desired formats.  Such formats are easily exportable from Google Calendar/Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Exchange or other common calendaring/email systems.  However, if you choose to convert electronic calendar items, for example, to PDF or printed format, to easily redact them, you must ensure that you have preserved the full content of the original calendar item record (as specified in requests 1 and 2), which contains many detailed headers beyond the ones generally printed out.  If you provide PDFs or printed items with only a few of the headers or lacking attachments/images, and therefore withhold the other headers/attachments without justification, you may be in violation of SF Admin Code 67.21, 67.26, 67.27, Govt Code 6253(a), 6253.9, and/or 6255, and we may challenge your decision.  We *do not* waive the requirement of 67.21(l) discussed above, and are merely instructing you to preserve information even if you provide to us the undesirable PDF format.\r\n\r\nFor word processing documents, either .docx or .pdf formats are fine.  For physical items, scanning to PDF format is acceptable.\r\n\r\nFor this request, we are asking for a City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017) search be performed of the Compliance Officer/Custodian of Records/Public Records Manager and all other members of your department's staff who are a member of or have ever attended the Group, such that each such employee either provide all records responsive to this request present on their personal accounts/devices/property (solely to the extent the record or portion thereof relates to the public's business), or provide a declaration/affidavit that no such records exist.  All such affidavits/declarations are also requested as responsive records to this request.  Please handle the government account record search as an immediate disclosure search, and the personal search under regular timelines.\r\n\r\nPlease provide only those copies of records available without any fees. If you determine certain records would require fees, please instead provide the required notice of which of those records are available and non-exempt for inspection in-person if we so choose.  Please use email for all responses.  I will not use any third-party records management private company's website, and I cannot be required to do so.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your immediate disclosure.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have conducted a diligent search for records responsive to your request. We have located responsive records and are releasing them to you. In particular, please see pages 100-102.If you have trouble accessing the files, we can burn the responsive records onto a CD at a rate of $1 per CD or load the responsive records onto a flash drive at a rate of $4 per flash drive. Fees for duplication are subject to change and postage is an additional cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf hard copies are needed, we can provide hard copies of any 8.5x11 documents that are made available to you at a cost of 10 cents per copy, as allowed by the San Francisco Administrative Code \u00a7 67.28(c). This section states \"a fee not to exceed 10 cents per page may be charged.\" Postage is an additional cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Public Records Act requires an agency to make available to any person a copy of an \u201cidentifiable record or records\u201d in its possession, unless the record is specifically exempt from disclosure. (Please see California Government Code \u00a7 6253(b).) The City\u2019s obligation under the Sunshine Ordinance, like the Public Records Act, is to produce public records in its custody. (See San Francisco Administration Code \u00a7 67.20(b).) There is no requirement that a department or officer construct a document to meet the specifications of the request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes your public records request.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid A.

In hundreds of PRA/FOIA requests this requester has made across the country, this is the fastest response he has received in a case of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe PRA response received at https://sanfrancisco.nextrequest.com/requests/19-3455 is the kind of response other City agencies should aspire to.\r\n==== End\r\n\r\nThere is no complaint, just a comment.\r\n\r\nWhile I am happy to call in to the meeting's accessible bridge conference call to make that public comment if so required, unless I happen to be presenting a case, it seems like it would be a lot of extra work for everyone involved.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnonymous",

In hundreds of PRA/FOIA requests this requester has made across the country, this is the fastest response he has received in a case of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe PRA response received at https://sanfrancisco.nextrequest.com/requests/19-3455 is the kind of response other City agencies should aspire to.\r\n==== End\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnonymous",

I have submitted the following written public comment to the SOTF agenda re: this request:\r\n\r\n==== Begin\r\nAnonymous requester would like to thank and commend David Steinberg, Custodian of Records, Public Works, for his and its professionalism and thoroughness in responding to an immediate disclosure request about the Custodian Working Group.\r\n\r\nIn less than one business day, Mr. Steinberg published online over 100 raw emails and other documents in their native format, metadata, and headers, without contention. In hundreds of PRA/FOIA requests this requester has made across the country, this is the fastest response he has received in a case of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe PRA response received at https://sanfrancisco.nextrequest.com/requests/19-3455 is the kind of response other City agencies should aspire to.\r\n==== End\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 23, 2019:\r\nSubject: [External Message Added] San Francisco public records request #19-3456\r\nSan Francisco\r\n\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\r\nHi there\r\n\r\nA message was sent to you regarding record request #19-3456:\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI just realized that yesterday when I responded to this request, I  inadvertently neglected to release the responsive records to you, I have released them now.\r\n\r\nPlease note that some of the records released yesterday in response to Public Records Request #19-3455 may also be responsive to this request.Because you submitted a single request that I entered as two requests in NextRequest to ensure I met the IDR deadlines, I did not duplicate such files here.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid A.

Immediate Disclosure Request\r\nDear SOTF,\r\n\r\nI do not know if your full task force meeting's public comment / agenda section allows a submission of written comment. If it does, I would like to include the following 3 paragraph, 109 word comment in writing for whatever is your next task force meeting's agenda:\r\n\r\n==== Begin\r\nAnonymous requester would like to thank and commend David Steinberg, Custodian of Records, Public Works, for his and its professionalism and thoroughness in responding to an immediate disclosure request about the Custodian Working Group.\r\n\r\nIn less than one business day, Mr. Steinberg published online over 100 raw emails and other documents in their native format, metadata, and headers, without contention.

This is a public mailbox, and all of your responses (including emails, attachments, file shares, and the disclosed records) may be automatically and instantly available to the general public on the MuckRock.com service used to issue this request (though I am not a MuckRock representative). Once you send them to us, there's no going back. **\r\n\r\nThe audio record of the August 7 SOTF meeting appears to reference a \"Custodian of Records Working Group\" (aka \"Custodian Working Group\", called the \"Group\" below) of public employees attempting to, among other things, lobby (in a colloquial sense), via a letter, the SOTF to impose certain suggestions or restrictions on the behavior of the public. Perhaps my impression is incorrect; I would like to know more.\r\n\r\nI request under the San Francisco Sunshine Ordinance (Ordinance) and the California Public Records Act (CPRA):\r\n\r\n1. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all agendas (draft or final) of meetings of the Group\r\n2. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all minutes (draft or final) of meetings of the Group\r\n3. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all listings of the membership/roster of the Group\r\n4. regular request: all supporting documentation used at meetings of the Group\r\n5. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all records showing any budget allocations or other financial support given to the Group\r\n6. regular request: all records that would demonstrate the public monies being used to support the activities of the Group (including showing the time spent by public employees performing Group work, for example calendar/schedule items showing when the meetings took place and who attended). Ms. Blackman said [in the Aug 7 SOTF audio record] that the signers spent \"quite a lot of time\" was spent writing this letter. Provide all records showing what public employee work time was spent writing this letter.\r\n7. IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE REQUEST: all records related to the attempt to lobby the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force to change their rules or procedures, including but not limited to the letter discussed at the SOTF Aug 7 meeting. Including a copy of the letter and all drafts or other versions of this letter.\r\n8. regular request: all correspondence between your Compliance Officer and/or Custodian of Records and/or Public Records Manager and the Group as an entity\r\n9. regular request: all correspondence between your Compliance Officer and/or Custodian of Records and/or Public Records Manager and any of { David Steinberg, Sue Blackman, Hank Heckel, Caroline Celaya, Marianne Mazzucco-Thompson } since Jan. 1, 2019.\r\n10. regular request: Ms. Celaya stated [in the Aug 7 SOTF audio record] that certain best practices have been generated. Provide all policies/best practices written by the Group.\r\n\r\nWe remind you of your obligations to provide electronic records in any format we request them in, as long as either you hold them in that format, the format is available to you, or the format is easy to generate (Admin Code 67.21(l)). Therefore, calendars exported in the .ics, iCalendar, or vCard formats (\"A\") and emails exported in the .eml or .msg formats (\"B\") with all non-exempt headers, metadata, attachments, etc. are our desired formats. Such formats are easily exportable from Google Calendar/Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Exchange or other common calendaring/email systems. However, if you choose to convert electronic calendar items, for example, to PDF or printed format, to easily redact them, you must ensure that you have preserved the full content of the original calendar item record (as specified in requests 1 and 2), which contains many detailed headers beyond the ones generally printed out. If you provide PDFs or printed items with only a few of the headers or lacking attachments/images, and therefore withhold the other headers/attachments without justification, you may be in violation of SF Admin Code 67.21, 67.26, 67.27, Govt Code 6253(a), 6253.9, and/or 6255, and we may challenge your decision. We *do not* waive the requirement of 67.21(l) discussed above, and are merely instructing you to preserve information even if you provide to us the undesirable PDF format.\r\n\r\nFor word processing documents, either .docx or .pdf formats are fine. For physical items, scanning to PDF format is acceptable.\r\n\r\nFor this request, we are asking for a City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017) search be performed of the Compliance Officer/Custodian of Records/Public Records Manager and all other members of your department's staff who are a member of or have ever attended the Group, such that each such employee either provide all records responsive to this request present on their personal accounts/devices/property (solely to the extent the record or portion thereof relates to the public's business), or provide a declaration/affidavit that no such records exist. All such affidavits/declarations are also requested as responsive records to this request. Please handle the government account record search as an immediate disclosure search, and the personal search under regular timelines.\r\n\r\nPlease provide only those copies of records available without any fees. If you determine certain records would require fees, please instead provide the required notice of which of those records are available and non-exempt for inspection in-person if we so choose. Please use email for all responses. I will not use any third-party records management private company's website, and I cannot be required to do so.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your immediate disclosure.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 79194-43289608@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:79194-43289608@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?url_auth_token=AAA14sR-yHY0_oqA8gf2otYwhbo%3A1i8Ky7%3A0ghjIFFvIxVBkn00LHTlIqDUwuI&next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fdepartment-of-public-works-4835%252Fcustodian-of-records-working-group-immediate-disclosure-request-79194%252F%253Femail%253Ddavid.steinberg%252540sfdpw.org\r\nIs this email coming to the wrong contact?

All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the use of body cameras, including:\r\n  a. policies or procedures governing use of body cameras;\r\n  b. what types of data are obtained;\r\n  c. the conditions under which body cameras are used;\r\n  d. the frequency of body camera use;\r\n  e. the number of body camera units or systems acquired;\r\n  f. the number of officers equipped with body cameras;\r\n\r\n2. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the review of body camera data by supervising officers or staff or civilian review personnel to ensure officer compliance with department or agency policies and applicable state and federal law;\r\n\r\n3. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the storage of data obtained using body cameras, including:\r\n  a. where the data is stored;\r\n  b. how long data is stored;\r\n  c. when data must be discarded; and\r\n  d. how much data your agency or department currently stores;\r\n\r\n4. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning access to body camera data, including:\r\n  a. the legal justification required before a law enforcement employee or member of the public may access body camera data;\r\n  b. purposes for which the data may be accessed;\r\n  c. purposes for which the data may not be accessed;\r\n  d. who may access the data, what procedures they must go through to obtain access, and who must authorize access; and\r\n  e. the existence of a system that records who accesses the data and when the data is accessed;\r\n\r\n5. All policies, practices, procedures, rules, or orders concerning the sharing of data obtained through body cameras, including:\r\n  a. what type of data is shared;\r\n  b. what databases your agency puts collected body camera data into; and\r\n  c. third parties, governmental or private, that may access your agency's body camera data, including what procedures a third party must go through to access the data and any restrictions placed on a third party regarding further sharing of your body camera data;\r\n\r\n6. All agreements to share body camera data with outside agencies or departments, corporations, or other entities; and\r\n\r\n7. All training materials used to instruct members of your department or agency in body camera deployment, data management, or operation of automated records systems that contain body camera data to which any member of your department or agency has access, including regional or shared databases.\r\n\r\nIf this records request is denied in whole or in part, please provide (1) whether the documents in question exists, and if so, (2) the statutory exemption you are claiming prevents their release. If Jackson Police Department claims an exemption for some of the requested documents, please produce those for which it does not claim an exemption, including records where the exempt portions are redacted. \r\n\r\nBecause the requested documents will be made available to the general public, this request is not being made for commercial purposes, and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest, I am requesting a waiver of any fees for searching or copying these records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. If possible, I prefer that the records be produced in electronic format.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBlake Feldman",

As documents responsive to your request are ready for disclosure, they will be provided to you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKirk Barney",

The district did not locate any email records for the years 2015 or 2016.\r\n\r\nThe files are too large to send through the district email system. I have placed them in a shared Google folder at this link<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PG3SXovIyg7A-475Ea6JzYdzjISNrxzv?usp=drive_link>. You may access, view and download the records. Be sure to save them for your use. The file will remain accessible for 30 days.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions about the records.\r\n\r\nWith this response, the district considers this request closed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTammy Bengen, Executive Assistant for\r\nAssistant Superintendent Equity, Engagement & Academics and\r\nAssistant Superintendent Business, Human Resources & Technology\r\n9401 Sharon Dr. | Everett, WA 98204\r\nbengentl@mukilteo.wednet.edu<mailto:bengentl@mukilteo.wednet.edu>\n",
