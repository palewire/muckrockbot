Specifically, I am requesting:\r\n\r\nAggregate Medicaid Billing Records:\r\nThe total amount billed to Medicaid for my involuntary detention in the summer of 2020 by Polk County Hospital Broadlawns Medical Center and its contractor, UnityPoint Broadlawns Psych Education Foundation. These entities operate under contracts with Carlyle Group subsidiary Sedgwick, functioning as a \"Third-Party Administrator\" registered under the fictitious name Iowa Communities Insurance Pool (ICAP). ICAP provides coverage for local entities such as the City of Clive, City of West Des Moines, City of Urbandale, City of Waukee, Dallas County, and the City of Ankeny.\r\nThis request seeks to investigate potential Medicaid fraud tied to my detention, which I believe was political retaliation for whistleblowing activities. Public reports, including the case at https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/ia-court-of-appeals/2019420.html, indicate Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds received Sedgwick resources, including flights, to allegedly conceal Medicaid fraud.\r\n\r\nMissing Medicaid Involuntary Hospitalization Invoices:\r\nConfirmation of whether Medicaid invoices related to Iowa Code 229 involuntary hospitalizations, missing since approximately 2018, have been received by the Polk County and Dallas County Auditors. If still missing, I request details on any known discrepancies or irregularities in Medicaid invoicing and reconciliation processes since 2018 be sent to Polk County/Dallas County Auditors with confirmation letter to myself and Iowa Senators Grassley and Ernst to remediate broken fraud controls in Iowa caused by Carlyle Sedgwick ICAP attorney \"advise\" that insured local law enforcement misprison Medicaid irregularities from their 99 County Attorneys and Senators Grassley/Ernst.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nChad Brewbaker",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Iowa Open Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am requesting records relating to the following matters. The requested records pertain to material disclosures by William Kelly, John Jarvey, and Stephen Locher that require correction in their ethics filings. These corrections are necessary so that litigants affected by these disclosures can take appropriate action to protect their liberty and property interests:\r\n\r\nUnauthorized Payments to Belin McCormick Law Firm from State of Iowa\r\nRecords of payments to the Belin McCormick Law Firm involving funds misappropriated under Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.7 and 13.11, originating from Iowa Board of Regents corporations. These include, but are not limited to, the $35,000 payment from the Iowa State University Foundation facilitated by Belin McCormick attorneys Zumbach and Boykin, which was subsequently directed to the Blouin for Governor Campaign in 2005 under Governor Tom Vilsack's administration (currently Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture). These payments were not disclosed by Hon. Stephen Locher, a shareholder of Belin McCormick, in his disclosures to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\nPayments to Belin McCormick on March 23, 2019\r\nRecords of payments exceeding $10,000 made to the Belin McCormick Law Firm by the Iowa GOP on or about March 23, 2019. These payments were not disclosed by firm shareholder Hon. Stephen Locher and are connected to an \"annoying speech\" warrant signed by his wife, Polk County Judge Sarah Crane. The warrant was based on a solitary SMS message referencing e-notary regulatory capture related to Doug Strawn's firm, LenderClose, sent to the registered agent and attorney for Flying Access Residuals LLC, which held a lending automation patent application under review by the USPTO.\r\n\r\nPayments to U.S. Judge John Jarvey\r\nRecords of annual payments from the State of Iowa to U.S. Judge John Jarvey, facilitated by Dana Oxley. These payments were not disclosed by Judge Jarvey in filings with the U.S. Court Administration or the Iowa Judicial Nominating Commission by Justice Oxley.\r\n\r\nPayments to William Kelly's Dentons Davis Brown Firm\r\nRecords of payments to William Kelly's firm, Dentons Davis Brown, involving funds misappropriated under Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.7 and 13.11 from Iowa Board of Regents corporations (e.g., ISU Daily). These payments were not disclosed by William Kelly in ethics filings with the Iowa Judicial Nominating Commission or U.S. Courts during his application process. Reference is made to the Iowa Bar Association article tying Bruce Rastetter's attorney of record, Leslie Behaunek, to JAG William Kelly and JAG Lucas Sterbick, who prosecuted the warrant signed by Judge Sarah Crane in 2019. [Link in support: https://www.iowabar.org/?pg=IowaLawyerMagazine&pubAction=viewIssue&pubIssueID=36019&pubIssueItemID=209236] Kelly further needs to disclose an estimated $20,000 of fraudulent Medicaid invoices he caused in summer of 2020 as alleged whistleblower retaliation. Kelly's quashing of Wellpath pharmacy fraud/abuse subpoenas related to US DHS ICE pharmacy contracts in November 2019 is public and can be added to his file.\r\n\r\nThe requested records are critical to ensuring compliance with ethics requirements and to allow litigants whose cases were affected by these undisclosed material relationships to take necessary steps to protect their liberty and property interests.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nChad Brewbaker",

If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files). Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, we additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nA waiver of search and review fees is appropriate here because disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(a), (b)(1)-(2), and because the request is not primarily in our commercial interest, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 5.45(a), (b)(3)(ii).\r\n\r\nThis Request is Not Primarily in Our Commercial Interest:\r\nThe requested information is not being sought for commercial purposes. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(a). We are news media requesters that can and will \u201ceffectively convey information to the public.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(ii).\r\n\r\nProduction of Responsive Records on a Rolling Basis:\r\nIn the event that a portion of the present request is completed before the full request is completed, we ask that the records be produced on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nLimitation of Fees:\r\nWe are also entitled to a limitation of fees because we are members of the news media. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). Accordingly, even if our application for a waiver of all fees is denied, we are entitled to a limitation of fees. As a news media requester, we are\u201centitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of duplication\u201d and can be charged only duplication fees after the first 100 pages or its cost equivalent. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b). We request that the information be provided in its native electronic format, and thus there should be no duplication fees.\r\n\r\nRequest for Explanation of Withholdings and Redactions:\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide a reasonable description of any withheld materials and a justification for all such withholdings that includes reference to the specific FOIA exemptions authorizing withholding and specific reasons why such exemptions apply. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.31. An agency shall withhold information only if \u201cthe agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\u201d or \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i). (Per Attorney General Garland\u2019s March 15, 2022 memorandum, \u201cIn case of doubt [regarding foreseeable harm or legal bar to disclosure], openness should prevail.\u201dWe therefore request that if the agency determines that an exemption applies, specific reasons be provided as to why disclosure would harm any interest protected by such exemption. An agency shall also \u201cconsider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible\u201d and \u201ctake reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii). We therefore request that the agency release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your reply within the FOIA-specified timeframe of 20 working days. Please let us know if there are any clarifications we can make to make this request easier and/or quicker to complete.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nAdrian Nesta",

Should the fees exceed $100, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees as I am requesting the information on behalf of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how master jury lists are created. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\nIf possible, please provide the requested documents electronically. However, if this is not feasible, please inform me of the available methods for obtaining these records. Further, if you expect a significant delay in responding to this request, please contact me with information concerning when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption that justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
