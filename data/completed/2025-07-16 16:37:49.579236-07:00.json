As you'll see, we do have a count of how many supervisees are \"Required to register as a sex offender,\" however, we cannot separate out only probation or parole with this report. Also, this is not checking against the actual sex offender registry, which is owned by the Virginia State Police, this only checks our own data for supervisees who are \"required to register.\" VSP may be able to assist you in providing additional information.\r\n\r\nThank you for contacting the Virginia Department of Corrections.\nBest,\r\n\r\nRiley O'Brien\r\nRecords Administrator\r\n804-584-3420",

Franklin\r\nRd Ewing, IL.\r\n\r\nI have attached the petition, secretary's report, proof of publication,\r\nOrder of denial of petition request, verbatim records from the court\r\nreporter, a letter of rehearing request from the petitioner, and a letter\r\nof denial of rehearing from the Regional Board of School Trustees.\r\n\r\nDocumentation of policy for investigating reports of residency fraud.\r\n\r\nThere is no policy for investigating residency fraud.  Districts have\r\nresidency policies by statute.  In instances where residency is being\r\nskirted, districts can hold residency hearings to remove those in\r\nviolation.  The Regional Superintendent of Schools is tasked with any\r\nappeals that result from such hearings.  I have none on record.  In\r\ninstances where violations are made known to me, a phone contact is made\r\nwith the school districts for them to pursue.\r\n\r\nDocument showing number of fraud claims made annually and if possible\r\nbroken down by adjudication status.\r\n\r\nA search of my correspondence shows 1 file on hand for a residency\r\ncomplaint (letter was anonymous).   I am including that letter,  with names\r\nredacted due to the very small nature of the district involved which would\r\nrisk the possibility of identifying the children involved.\n*Matt Renaud*\r\n*Regional Superintendent of Schools*\r\n*Regional Office of Education #13*\r\n*Clinton-Jefferson-Marion-Washington Counties*",

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Redex Corp. The FBI has located approximately 2948 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFOIA Negotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nNeed a status check?

Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, we would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  If you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nThe current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 56 months. \r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one. \r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-4894.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov\r\n540-868-4894",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Reynolds:\r\n\r\nOn January 24, 2025, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) FOIA office received your FOIA request and assigned it control number DOI-2025-03235.  Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request.  You request the following information:\r\n\r\nAll communications that include the term \"Gulf of America\" or \"renaming the Gulf of Mexico\".\r\n\r\nThis should include\u2013but not be limited to\u2014emails, notes, memoranda and presentations between USGS staff and between USGS staff and external third parties.\r\n\r\nPlease include all documentation within the period January 1, 2024 to January 22, 2025, inclusive.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 2025, the USGS FOIA office received a similar FOIA request from Mr. Dave Levinthal, assigned control number DOI-2025-003169, for the following information:\r\n\r\nRequest disclosure from the Office of the Director, Office of Communications and Publishing, U.S. Board on Geographic Names, Office of the Alaska Regional Director, and Office of the Southeast Regional Director.\r\n\r\n1. Any records and documents \u2014 including but not limited to emails, memoranda, notes, electronic chat messages and calendar items \u2014 that include any of the following words/names in either uppercase or lowercase form on changing the name:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America\r\n\u2022 Denali to Mt. McKinley or Mount McKinley\r\n\r\n2. The same types of records on purchase of Greenland\r\n\r\nThe date range for this request is January 1, 2025, to the present.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 2025, the USGS FOIA office received a similar FOIA request from Bloomberg News, assigned control number DOI-2025-003184, for the following information:\r\n\r\nRequest disclosure from the US Geological Survey's U.S. Board on Geographic Names\r\n\r\n1) All records, which includes, but is not limited to emails (including attachments), text messages, internal studies, final reports, directives, memos, letters, on changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America.\"\r\n\r\n2)The same types of records on changing the name of Denali to \"Mount McKinley.\"\r\n\r\n3) Emails (including attachments) of U.S. Board on Geographic Names staff that mention \"Gulf of America\"\r\n\r\n4) Emails of U.S. Board on Geographic Names staff that mention Denali or Mount McKinley.\r\n\r\nThe timeframe for this request is January 1, 2025 to the present.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, on January 22, 2025, the USGS FOIA office received a similar FOIA request from WIRED, assigned control number DOI-2025-003203, for the following information:\r\n\r\nRecords dated from December 1, 2024 through the time this request is processed relating to Donald Trump's desire to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America and the related executive order and in the possession of Michael Tischler, Shellie Zahniser, or Chris Hammond of the U.S. Geological Survey.  The term \u201crecords\u201d includes emails (with attachments) but also refers to other documents and items, such as text messages; invitations, communications, and chats from meeting applications such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams; encrypted apps such as Signal, WhatsApp, and others; phone records; calendar entries; recordings of virtual or in-person meetings; and communications on collaboration platforms such as Slack. It omits news articles and messages from listservs that distribute them unless accompanied by substantial commentary from one of the above-named people or an interlocutor.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the Complex processing track.  We have gathered materials as potentially responsive to DOI-2025-003169, DOI-2025-003184, and DOI-2025-003203.  However, we have not yet completed a review of these records.  We will provide records in rolling releases to you in conjunction with releases issue for DOI-2025-003169, DOI-2025-003184, and DOI-2025-003203.\r\n\r\nWe classified you as an \u201cother use\u201d requester.  As such, we may charge you for some of our search and duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our review costs; you are also entitled to up to 2 hours of search time and 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.49(a)(1).  We do not anticipate any fees related to your request.\r\n\r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.  You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:\r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road \u2013 OGIS\r\nCollege Park, Maryland  20740-6001\r\nTelephone:     (202) 741-5770\r\nFax:                 (202) 741-5769\r\nToll-free:         1-877-684-6448\r\nE-mail:            ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>\r\nWeb:                https://www.archives.gov/ogis\r\n\r\nPlease note that using OGIS services does not affect the timing of filing an appeal with the Department\u2019s FOIA & Privacy Act Appeals Officer.

Please be advised that a contractor, Unity Health Care, Inc., provides health care services to DOC inmates. The information you are requesting relates to the contractor\u2019s personnel matter. It is not the kind of information that DOC creates and maintains. Under the FOIA, an agency\u2019s search obligation is limited to records or information the agency has created and/or maintained. Finally, DOC did not create and did not find the requested list.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this response a denial of your FOIA request, please be advised that, under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR 412, you may appeal to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nIf you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal\u201d or \u201cFOIA Appeal\u201d in the subject line of the letter as well as on the outside of the envelope.  The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request, (2) a copy of this letter, (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and or arguments advanced in support of disclosure, and (4) a daytime telephone number, and e-mail and/or U.S. Mail address at which you can be reached.  The appeal must be emailed to foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov> or mailed to the Mayor\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (MOLC) at 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 407, Washington, D.C. 20004. Further, a copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to me.\r\n\r\nFailure to follow these administrative steps will result in delay in the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal to the Mayor.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOluwasegun Obebe\nRecords, Information & Privacy Officer\r\nDC Department of Corrections\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\n3924 Minnesota Ave, NE\r\nWashington, DC 20019\r\n(202) 671-2055 (O)\r\n(202) 538-2389 (C)\r\n(202) 671-1705 (F)\r\nSegun.obebe@dc.gov<mailto:Segun.obebe@dc.gov>\r\nwww.doc.dc.gov<http://www.doc.dc.gov/>\r\n[cid:image003.jpg@01DBDADE.CB5B3A30]",

Pursuant to per WAC 44-14-04003(6)<https://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=44-14-04003>, we are not obligated to create a record in order to fulfill this request:\r\n\r\n(6) No duty to create records. An agency is not obligated to create a new record to satisfy a records request. However, sometimes it is easier for an agency to create a record responsive to the request rather than collecting and making available voluminous records that contain small pieces of the information sought by the requestor or find itself in a controversy about whether the request requires the creation of a new record. The decision to create a new record is left to the discretion of the agency. With respect to databases, for example, there is not always a simple dichotomy between producing an existing record and creating a new record. In addition, an agency may decide to provide a customized service and if so, assess a customized service charge for the actual costs of staff technology expertise needed to prepare data compilations, or when such customized access services are not used by the agency for other business purposes.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you wish to receive the records responsive to items 1, 3a and 3b there is a fee of $3.50. I have attached the worksheet for how the fee was calculated based off the fact that necessary redactions will be applied to some documents. Please call the main line below during normal business hours Mon-Fri 8:30-4:30) to pay your fee. We will be closed tomorrow, 6/19.\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive payment by 6/27/25 your request will be considered abandoned and closed.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DBE033.AC1569C0]\r\nMiranda Jeter\r\nRecords Clerk\r\nBonney Lake Police Department\r\nOffice Phone (253) 863 - 2218 opt. 4\r\nFax  (253) 863 - 2661\r\n18421 Veterans Memorial Drive E.

Your request was sent to JMD by the US Marshals Service as a misdirected request. The identifying tracking number was 2025-USMS-001026.  For your information, the Justice Management Division assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited. Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track. Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month whereas complex requests necessarily take longer. At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track. Please note that as a general matter, records in the Department are decentralized and our response will only cover information originating with or relating to JMD. If you are seeking information originating with or relating to other components of the Department, please make a FOIA request directly to those components.  If you have a question about the status of your FOIA request, you may contact this office by emailing JMDFOIA@usdoj.gov or by calling 202-616-0253 during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Eastern Time, excluding federal holidays).  Please refer to your assigned JMD FOIA TRACKING NUMBER listed above whenever you contact the Department regarding this request.  Sincerely,  Daniel Wagner FOIA Contact Justice Management Division",

This form includes 30 questions across several categories and appears to be the basis for the 3.81 aggregate score posted on the district\u2019s website in the June meeting minutes. \r\n\r\nTo clarify, can you please confirm whether Form 2 was completed by members of the Board of Education as part of the 2024\u20132025 evaluation process? If so, I respectfully request copies\u2014draft or final\u2014of any completed versions of this form in their entirety. The rubric responses and section-level evaluations offer important context for understanding the final composite score.

You may inspect and/or download these records via this link: https://atg-wa.box.com/s/fd9ijxugnwko6ku4c7rtgrgh10x7h3ei . Please do so within 30 days. Records provided via Box are free of charge. You do not need a Box account to access the records. If a password is required to access the records, one will be provided to you in a separate email. We did not withhold or redact any information in these records. If you prefer to receive these records on CD, USB thumb drive, or paper, there is a charge.

This means that the Attorney General\u2019s Office will not further address the request, and that is the date from which the Public Records Act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review starts to run.

Maryland and/or Giglio v. United States. During the current administration of District Attorney Barbara Romo, we have had one Giglio disclosure letter and case re: former Officer Robert Turney in our Cibola County District. Included here is a document fragment detailing the underlying case. The allegation of misconduct came from a discovery from the district court; therefore, we don\u2019t have specific additional records other than the attached letters to:\r\n\r\n  *   The letter the Sheriff of Cibola County asked our deputy to draft and send.\r\n  *   The spreadsheet detailing the cases for which we had to submit a disclosure letter.\r\n  *   A copy of the disclosure letter.( Each letter heading was corrected for each case otherwise the body of the letter was the same, the letter attached is a sample).\r\n  *   Letter to the Defense Counsel\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n//Melissa Howden//\r\n\r\n\r\nMelissa A.

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Iowa Open Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am seeking data to understand offenders who have double forms of community supervision (i.e. parole and sex offender registry (SOR)). Iowa Department of Corrections had helped to provide a list of all offenders on probation and parole. I would like to be able to cross reference that list with the current Iowa SOR to pull the data I am seeking. I would like to request that the Division provide the list of offenders on the SOR currently. \r\n\r\nIf that request is not possible, I wonder if the Division has: the exact number of people who are 1) on both the sex offender registry and probation; and 2) on both the sex offender registry and parole; as per the latest available data is requested.\r\n\r\nIf another agency has this data, I request the name of that agency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWendy Sawyer",
