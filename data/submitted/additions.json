I would like these records in electronic format, sent via email or other digital method, and again, please release documents on a rolling basis, as they become available.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that any of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, I ask you to note whether the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am a member of the news media as a reporter for Business Insider, and the requested documents are in the public interest and not being made for commercial purposes. Therefore, I ask that all fees are waived in the processing of my request. If fees associated with this request will be in excess of $25, kindly notify me in advance of fulfilling this request. As I am making this request as a journalist and this information is timely, I would appreciate your communicating with me if you have questions regarding this request.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and if there are any questions about my request, can provide any clarification that will help expedite the processing of my request, please contact me at nparakul@insider.com.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your reply within 20 business days, as the statute requires and an even more prompt reply if you can make a determination without having to review the records in question.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
