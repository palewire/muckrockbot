Specific Inquiry\r\n\r\nI am seeking to determine if these four individuals were present at the same forum events, specifically within the \"Young Leaders Forum,\" the \"Fintech/IT Innovation\" pavilions, or the plenary sessions organized by the Roscongress Foundation.\r\n\r\nIII. Keyword Search Parameters\r\n\r\nTo facilitate a comprehensive search of electronic records, cables, photo archives and internal databases, I request that the following keywords be used:\r\n\r\nEntities: \"Vdolg.ru\", \"Vdolg\", \"\u0412\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\", \"Roscongress\", \"SPIEF 2015\", \"Young Leaders Forum\", \"P2P lending Russia\".\r\n\r\nIndividuals (Phonetic/Aliases): \"Mifsud\", \"Jeffrey Epstein\", \"Andreyev, Anton\", \"Andreev, Anton\", \"Timoshenkova, Darya\", \"Timoshenkova, Daria\", \"Aslanova, Daria\", \"Aslanova, Darya\", \"\u0414\u0430\u0440\u044c\u044f \u0410\u0441\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430.\"\r\n\r\nTechnical/Operational: \"INN 7714808861\", \"Project Lakhta\", \"Information Operations St. Petersburg\", \"Identity Harvesting\", \"Digital Sovereignty Forum\".\r\n\r\nIII. Targeted Offices\r\n\r\nPlease search the records of the National Security Council (NSC), the Office of the National Security Advisor, and any \"Spot Reports\" or cables shared by the U.S. Embassy in Moscow (specifically the Political-Economic and Regional Security sections).\r\n\r\nNote: Of special interest is the possible convergence of Epstein, Mifsud, Andreyev and Timoshenkova in one event. \r\n\r\nAndreyev and Timoshenkova were pioneers in Russian FinTech and used their expertise to create the financial infrastructure that assisted the Kremlin's 2016 election interference efforts. The Epstein files includes several documents which detail Epstein's interest in attending the networking event and hobnobbing with young Russians in the financial sector. Here is an example: https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01191262.pdf\r\n\r\nPlain language: If Epstein was at this event, documentation of it by the U.S. government would have likely been generated. \r\n\r\nThank you to the Obama Presidential Library and for the library's commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
