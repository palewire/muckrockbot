An appellate court decision, SEIU Healthcare 775 NW v. DSHS, 193 Wn. App. 377 (2016) holds that when a city receives a request for documents that includes a list of individuals, the City is required to determine whether the list will be used for \u201ccommercial purposes.\u201d The case concluded that a requestor has a commercial purpose if the requestor intends to use the list for direct or indirect profit-making activity, regardless of whether the requestor intends to contact the individuals on the list or even if the individuals are personally affected by the release of the list or not. If the City has some indication that a requester intends to use a list of individuals for a commercial purpose, we are required to \u201cinvestigate further\u201d before we disclose that list. \r\nFurther, the SEIU case held that even an affirmation stating that any responsive records received for a request which include lists of individuals will not be used for commercial purposes, is not sufficient.\u00a0 Instead, before we can release the records providing the requested information, we are required to obtain from you sufficient details as to what you intend to use the list for so that we can make an independent evaluation as to whether or not your purpose is commercial or not. \r\n\r\nIf you wish to obtain the record referenced above which includes a list of individuals, please fill out and return the Commercial Purpose Declaration which is available by accessing your account through the \"My Request Center\" on the City's public records request portal (GovQA). A determination will then be made as to whether your stated purpose regarding the use of the list(s) of individuals contained in any compiled responsive records is sufficient to allow for the release of this information. To avoid unnecessary delay in obtaining these specific responsive records for your request, please return the completed declaration at your earliest opportunity. We will follow up with you within five business days as to the validity of the stated purpose relating to your request. Upon determination that your completed declaration is valid, we anticipate providing these emails in your next installment. \r\n\r\nPlease provide the completed affidavit as soon as possible, but within 30 days of today\u2019s date, or by October 13, 2023. If we have not heard back from you in this regard by that date, we will be unable to provide you with the record located that include a list of individuals. \r\n\r\nStaff is still in the process of reviewing the records located by Police Department staff. Per section 18 on page 9 of the contract being provided to you via your GovQA account, we are required to notify Forensic Logic LLC. of your public records request and provide them with the opportunity pursuant to RCW 42.56.540 (court protection of public records), to enjoin (stop) the City\u2019s release of the responsive records. If no court ordered injunction is received from the company by the date prescribed to them, the records will be provided to you. \r\n\r\nWe reasonably anticipate requiring approximately 50 days, or until on or about November 2, 2023, to provide a next installment for your request. We will follow up with you on or about that date regarding the status of your request. If responsive records become available in advance of this estimate, we will let you know. Conversely, if City staff encounters a need to extend our estimate, we will advise accordingly. \r\nSincerely, \r\nSabrina Groves \r\nAdministrative Specialist",

If we have not received a completed and valid commercial purpose declaration from you by that date, we will be unable to release the record located that includes a list of individuals. \r\n\r\nFurther, Staff is still in the process of reviewing the records located by Police Department staff.

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Daniel Bledsoe. As you probably recall, the FBI located approximately 1330 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFOIA Negotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nNeed a status check?

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll publicly releasable military and civilian records for Louis Jolyon West (October 6, 1924 \u2013 January 2, 1999). Mr. West's social security number was  395-16-2395. He served in the United States Air Force (USAF) between approximately 1948 and 1956, and worked as a civilian contractor at the 3700th USAF Hospital at the Lackland Air Force Base after that. Therefore, I am requesting the following information from Mr. West's Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) and his Official Personnel Folder (OPF). This information includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Name\r\n\r\n\u2022 Service Number\r\n\r\n\u2022 Certificate of Release/Discharge Papers, aka DD form 214\r\n\r\n\u2022 Dates of Service\r\n\r\n\u2022 Branch of Service\r\n\r\n\u2022 Final Duty Status\r\n\r\n\u2022 Final Rank\r\n\r\n\u2022 Salary\r\n\r\n\u2022 Assignments and Geographical Locations\r\n\r\n\u2022 Source of Commission\r\n\r\n\u2022 Military Education Level\r\n\r\n\u2022 Awards and decorations\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian positions\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian titles\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian salaries\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian grades\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian job locations\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the National Personnel Records Center has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nYou will find as an attachment a copy of Mr. West's obituary from the The New York Times, published on January 9, 1999.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Mr. West, per the attached obituary, was a figure of considerable public interest. He worked for the government, both during his time in the USAF and as a civilian contractor, during the Korean War, on research related to the alleged brainwashing of American prisoners-of-war, by Korean, Soviet, and Chinese officials. Mr. West's OMPF and OPF would help provide the public with a better understanding of military and civilian-guided research on this subject during the Korean War.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nI am following up on a request sent under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552, on August 8, 2023. I have not received a response identifying a request number and thus cannot provide that information at this time.\r\n\r\nIn my original request, attached, I asked for the Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) and Official Personnel Folder (OPF) for Louis Jolyon West (October 6, 1924 \u2013 January 2, 1999; SSN 395-16-2395). Mr. West served in the United States Air Force (USAF) between approximately 1948 and 1956 and worked as a civilian contractor for the USAF at the 3700th USAF Hospital at the Lackland Air Force Base after that.  I am reproducing a copy of the New York Times obituary I attached to the original request.\r\n\r\nBy law, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(i), agencies are required to make a determination within 20 working days of a request. Given that the request was sent on August 8th, at least 49 working days have passed as of the date of the correspondence and as such, I am requesting an update on the status of my request. This includes both a request number and time frame for processing.\r\n\r\nI am also renewing my request for a fee waiver. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Mr. West, per the attached obituary, was a figure of considerable public interest. He worked for the government, both during his time in the USAF and as a civilian contractor, during the Korean War, on research related to the alleged brainwashing of American prisoners-of-war by Korean, Soviet, and Chinese officials. Mr. West's OMPF and OPF would help provide the public with a better understanding of military and civilian-guided research on this subject during the Korean War.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

I was curious if this dataset is representative of the 2023 fiscal year (from 7/1/2022 - 6/30/2023) as requested, or if the data provided was an as-of \"snapshot\" based on the report run date? I ask because it appears there are several employees with \"Company Seniority Dates\" and \"Employees State Begin Dates\" beyond the 2023 fiscal year. Can you also clarify which field should be considered the Employee Start Date, and may we also get a list of non-abbreviated \"Companies\"?",

Looking at some specific employees existing in 2022 that do not exist in the 2023 data, it appears that most of those records belong to \"Faculty, University Staff, and Political Jurisdiction Staff\" with record counts of those classifications having the approximate record count of the difference between the two files. \r\n\r\nWould you be able to clarify the effective date of the data (FY 2023 as requested, or a snapshot in time as of the run of the report), as well as the field that could be considered Employee Start Date? Would it be possible to include these records in the 2023 disclosure as they were provided in response to a separate request for 2022 employee compensation data?  If you could a \"key\" between the company abbreviation provided and their non-abbreviated descriptions/names, that would also be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nTyler",

        "communication": "Dear Jenny Wadhwa: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P044805-103023.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G.

Gotbaum (September 5, 1921 - April 5, 2015). Proof of death is not required as his death was widely reported: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/nyregion/victor-gotbaum-labor-leader-who-helped-save-new-york-from-bankruptcy-dies-at-93.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPaul Galante\n\n",
