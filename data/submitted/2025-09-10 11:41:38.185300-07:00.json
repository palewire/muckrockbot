That prior release confirms that such presentation materials are regularly prepared, used, and subject to disclosure under the Public Records Law.\r\n\r\nBy way of example, additional Community CompStat presentations were held in District D-4 (South End) on Aug 27th, and in other districts citywide during this August and September 2025 time period.  Feel free to exclude the Aug 26 E-13 presentation that has already been provided if it makes it easier for you. \r\n\r\nPlease provide the complete presentation materials (e.g., PowerPoint, slide deck, PDF, or other format) as displayed at each meeting.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Please use the following unique FOIA tracking number CBP-FO-2025-196898 to track the status of your request.  If you have not already done so, you must create a SecureRelease account. This is the only method available to check the status of your pending FOIA request. \n\nProvisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations. By submitting your request, you have agreed to pay up to $25.00 in applicable processing fees, if any fees associated with your request exceed this amount, CBP shall contact you. \nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request.  Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, CBP processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.  Although CBP\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). \n\nAs your request seeks a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records, CBP will invoke a 10-day extension for your request pursuant to  6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c).  If you would like to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office.  We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nCBP\u2019s FOIA Division is working hard to reduce the amount of time necessary to respond to FOIA requests.  We truly appreciate your continued patience. \nFor additional information please consult CBP FOIA website please click on FOIA Act Resources or visit http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \nSincerely, \n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n",

A uniformed security patrol officer in a Citiguard vehicle approached them. The security officer asks them to stop recording and leave property, and then appears to initiate a vehicle pursuit in a Citiguard marked patrol vehicle on public roads that reach reported speeds of 70mph to 100mph. According to BSIS's website, Citiguard's owner is GHARZAI NOMAIR, and Citiguard has two  previous citations for employing non-licensed security officers. \r\n\r\nAs such, I am requesting the following:\r\n1) Citiguard's License, Certificates, or other verification documents that indicate their authority to work in California City, CA\r\n2) Citiguard's current Private Patrol Operator application and/or most recent renewal application, packet, or documentation submitted to achieve BSIS licensure for license 121572, and for any branch or other licenses that permit Citiguard's operations within California City, CA. \r\n3) Any complaints, investigations, notices, or tips related to Citiguard from January 2024 through the date of completion of this request \r\n4) Any emails that your office has received or sent relating to the September 2nd, 2025 incident involving Citiguard at the CoreCivic Detention Center\r\n5) Any Citiguard policies relating to foot or vehicle pursuits, use of force continuum, verbal de-escalation, or patrol SOPs that are in your possession\r\n\r\nThis is a newsworthy event, I respectfully request that you expedite this request to the extent possible. You may send documents as they become available. I appreciate you taking the time to fulfil this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
