        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "Dear Records Requestor:\r\n\r\nOur School District wishes to acknowledge receipt of your recent request for copies of public records, received on Friday, November 5, 2021.\r\n\r\nYour records request seems clear in one respect, as to the records you wish to have copied and provided to you by the initial segment of your request.  But, the second segment of your  request is not clear to us.  So, we are in need of clarification from you as to that segment.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is clear by the first segment of your request that you wish to receive a copy of every public records request that has been submitted to our School District, going back historically for more than a decade, to January 1, 2010.\r\n\r\nIt will be a daunting and time-consuming task to locate all of those records for duplication and production to you.  Some of those requests would have been received by us in electronic format only, e.g., such as via email.  Those would not have been forwarded to any central electronic file location, nor printed to a paper copy and placed in any particular physical file location.  As well, requests of that sort would not necessarily have been received by the person designated as our public records officer at the time the request was received.  Rather, any given request could conceivably been received by any other given employee in our District.\r\n\r\nFor additional reasons, designing a search methodology calculated to locate all such emailed requests would be very difficult, if not impossible.  That is because we cannot be required to read every single email received by every employee in our School District over the last ten-plus years, to locate for you those had content qualifying them as public records request.  That likely means the next alternative search methodology would be to employ electronic \"keyword\" searches, of our \"inbound\" email databases over the last ten years.  But those sorts of searches could well be unreliable, to in-fact yield all such requests, as it would be the case that some, if not many, records requestors did not cite our public disclosure law in making their requests, nor even use any particular words or phrasing - such as \"public record\" - when submitting their requests.  In fact, our state's public disclosure law provides that in order for a public agency like our District to be compelled to process a records request under that statute, the records requestor need not submit it to a particular employee of ours, but s/he need not provide a citation to that public disclosure law nor reference it by name or in any other manner, nor use any particular language in submitting the request.\r\n\r\nSo, to create a list of \"keyword\" search terms that would likely yield every single records request that our District has received, via email over the last ten-plus years, could indeed be a practical impossibility.  However, when faced with such a situation, our public disclosure laws suggest we dialogue with a requestor in your position, toward a cooperative collaboration aimed at generating a mutually agreed-upon list of keyword search terms that can be used to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nSo, toward that end, I'd like to initiate that dialogue.  Would you please give me a call or email me to dialogue on that point?\r\n\r\nAside from those difficulties with locating all electronic public records requests we've received over the last ten-plus years, we of course have received such requests in the form of physical (i.e., paper).  These largely would exist only in files contained in boxes in our School District's archives.  To search those files will take an immense amount of staff time.\r\n\r\nIn any case, because of the number and variety of locations of records requests in need of being located, copied, and produced to you in response to the first segment of your request, we plan to fulfill it in a series of partial-batch-installments.  We are now estimating that you should expect to receive the first installment within 60 days of this email, on or before January 14, 2022.\r\n\r\nAlso, before we provide you that first installment, we likely will need an advance pre-payment from you of the cost-of-production charges that are allowable under our state's public disclosure law.  I will advise you if that will be necessary, and of the required amount, within that same 60-day period.\r\n\r\nSecond, as I said above, we are uncertain of the scope of records you wish us to locate for you, by your language stating you wish to receive: \"a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses\" to each of the public records requests we'll be providing you.   By \"Responses,\" that could be fairly interpreted in many different ways, as to the scope of records you do or do not wish to receive.  For instance, it could mean you wish only to receive copies of the actual; records that School District gathered, copied, and provided to each given requestor, in \"Response\" to his or her request (i.e., because those records had content falling within the descriptive scope of the request).  On the other hand, we frequently \"Respond\" to requestors by directing letters or email communications to them that contain no actual \"Responsive\" records, but instead communicate with the requestor about any number of points of information or inquiry that arise in the course of processing records requests (in fact, this email is a precise example of that sort of \"Response\".)\r\n\r\nSo, we're in need of receiving clarification from you, by way of a reasonably specific description, as to the scope of records that you do wish to receive by that second segment of your request.\r\n\r\nPer the above, I will now look forward to engaging in the dialogue I've initiated with you, concerning collaboratively working together toward a mutually-agreeable list of \"keyword\" searches that we can utilize to locate the emailed public records requests you've requested, and also to receiving the clarification I requested above.\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

        "communication": "Dear Requestor:\r\n\r\nThank you for your inquiry about the initial response you received from me to your records request to our School District, and the one you received from the counterpart representative of mine at the Mead School District.  While we are extremely busy with other matters and our School District has no obligation to dedicate the time or effort necessary to answer your inquiry, we\u2019re more than happy to do so on this occasion.  That\u2019s because it is essential, for successful fulfillment of your request, to foster the sort of mutually collaborative dialogue with you that I offered and requested of you in the very same initial response email about which you are inquiring.  In fact, that sort of affirmative collaborative communication is exactly what the regulations under the Washington Public Records Act (\u201cPRA\u201d) call for, reciprocally from a requestor such as yourself and our District, when questions exist \u2013 as they do here, with your request \u2013 about just what particular records do and do not need to be located for production, and when \u2013 also as here \u2013 difficulties are presented by the request as to how to best go about searching to locate all responsive records that happen to exist in electronic form.\r\n\r\nSo, please accept the following explanation as to why you received like initial responses from our School District and the Mead School District and why the same may well be occurring by this email in response to the inquiry you\u2019ve now made \u2013 and why that, of course, was and is not at all a matter of coincidence.\r\n\r\nIt is not infrequent that our School District receives a PRA records request that, by its unique nature, volume, and/or ambiguity, prompts us to double-check on the steps we ought to take to make sure we entirely fulfill all of the obligations we owe the requestor under the PRA.  And in the course of that, it is not at all uncommon that we find it appropriate to consult for assistance/advice with PRA resources outside of our office, for additional expertise that might supplement our District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d PRA-processing experience and abilities.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to requests like yours, we and many other school districts believe that outside consultation is in fact a \u201cbest practice.\u201d  Doing so not only operates to the benefit of the school district that is in need of processing the request, but just as much to the benefit of the records requestor.  In short, that sort of outside-resource consultation enhances assurances that the requestor will indeed receive an appropriately-timely and -thorough production of a copy of every reasonably-locatable, non-exempt public record that s/he/it seeks, as the end-product of the district\u2019s execution of search and production steps that were, from the very outset, very concertedly designed to assure that the requestor indeed receives full performance of all obligations owed her/him/it under public disclosure requirements.\r\n\r\nAs I said, many other school districts in our state engage in that same best practice, by seeking supplemental PRA assistance from resources outside their own records-processing staff, to assure they properly process and fulfill a request like yours.  And sometimes, some of them by happenstance coincidentally consult with to the same, common outside resource for that assistance.\r\n\r\nSo, when two or more school districts have received the same, identical request, and they happen to have consulted with the same external PRA resource to help assure they give a proper initial response to the request, it is not a surprise if they happen to \u201cland on the same spot\u201d in communicating their initial responses to the same request/requestor.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what happened here.  Since the verbiage, substance, and detail of your requests to both our School District and the Mead District were and are precisely identical, we and that District were prompted by a need to address with you the exact same records-collection, technology, time frame, dialogue/clarification, etc., issues with you, via our respective initial responses; and by happenstance, we consulted with the same outside source for assistance with our respective initial responses, toward the aim of best fulfilling your request to your ultimate satisfaction.\r\n\r\nFor that same reason, as I stated above, it would not be surprising and indeed quite that you may well receive this same explanation, virtually identically, to the exact same inquiry you\u2019ve now directed to both of our districts.\r\n\r\nStill, having provided the foregoing, we  want to acknowledge and assure you that we in no way plan to provide you any sort of a \u201ccookie cutter\u201d approach to the continuing processing and fulfillment of your request.  That could not properly occur under the obligations we owe you under the PRA.  We fully understand that when a records request we\u2019ve received has also been identically submitted to another (or more than one other) school district, at some point \u2013 usually fairly early on \u2013 that request must and will be handled differently and uniquely by us, as compared to the different sort of handling that (or those) other district(s) must and will need to dedicate to their proper processing of that same request.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s so for virtually innumerable reasons.  Some of those, just by way of examples, would be that we are most certainly differently-situated as compared to the Mead District to the particular internal processes we have adopted for processing records requests, once we are assured we know the specific parameters of the scope of records implicated by the request; we doubtless have differing particularities in the protocols we have followed in our paper and electronic records-filing and -archiving systems, relative to how and where records responsive to the request in likely to be located in our District; comparatively greater or lesser staffing levels will exist, as between that District and ours, in terms of the volume and \u201cquality\u201d of human resources we and they have to dedicate to the processing of your request, particularly in terms of experience or expertise levels amongst records-processing staff members as to unique issues raised by the request; differences in availability of that staff to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other high-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our respective Districts\u2019 abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and protecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us; the numbers of employees outside of our records-processing staffs (e.g., administrators/teachers/others employed in our schools who will need to dedicate time to assisting in the records-gathering process for the request, and their ability to perform that work while still performing their duties; different levels of experience, technologies, and staff availability in our respective IT departments who likely will need to work on the request; etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons I\u2019ve stated, the appropriate \u201csameness\u201d of our School District\u2019s processing of your request, as between ourselves and the Mead District (or for that matter, as compared to any other school district that has received your request) likely will end very shortly \u2013 indeed we\u2019d expect, upon the occurrence of the requested, collaborative dialogue with you on the points that were identified in my initial response to you.  So I do look very much look forward to hearing from you so that we can address those points, and we can proceed with the benefit of that planned, good discussion in the best possible posture toward fulfilling your request in a timely and thorough manner that best meets your records and informational needs.\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360\u2013604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

        "communication": "Hello Ms. Cornelison,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response.\r\n\r\nI disagree with many of your statements in regards to the District\u2019s legal obligations for compliance with the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nPlease note RCW 42.56.030:\r\n\r\n\u2018The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may maintain control over the instruments that they have created. This chapter shall be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed to promote this public policy and to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other act, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe following are responses to your request for \u201cclarification\u201d dated 11-16-2021:\r\n\r\n1. Please address any questions you may have regarding this public records request (PRR) in writing via email.\r\n\r\n2. You stated the District was \u201cuncertain\u201d as to the scope of records requested and you then requested a \u201creasonably specific description\u201d as to the scope of records requested.\r\n\r\nI begin my response below by incorporating the text of the original public records request dated 11-4-2021:\r\n\r\n\u201cI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Evergreen Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo further clarify this request: \r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all original PRA requests. If the original PRA request was made via email, I request the NATIVE electronic format to be produced. If the original request was made via US mail or limited to written paper form only, I request an electronic .pdf copy of the original request.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all communications between the District and the PRA requestor regarding the processing and any other aspect of production for the  PRR. All communications, requests for clarification and replies are responses by the District and were previously requested in my original request. If the communications between the District and the requestor were via email I request the NATIVE electronic email format to be produced. If the communications between the District and the original requestor were limited to written paper form I request a .pdf copy of any communications.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all \u201crecords and writings\u201d as defined by RCW 42.56 previously produced by the District in response to the original PRA request. If the District produced electronic files in response to a PRA request, I request a duplicate copy of the files produced. If the District produced paper copies in response to a PRA request, I request a .pdf copy of those paper copies to be produced. \r\n\r\n3. As for keyword searches and the District\u2019s expressed difficulty in locating electronic and paper public records requests over the years, unfortunately I cannot offer guidance other than to suggest the District immediately seek and retain additional expertise that might supplement District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d PRA-processing experience and abilities. This PRR is not for keywords but rather for public records previously produced by the District.\r\n\r\nPlease reference WAC 44-14-04003 (10) Searching for records.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn agency must conduct an objectively reasonable search for responsive records. The adequacy of a search is judged by the standard of reasonableness. A requestor is not required to \"ferret out\" records on his or her own. A reasonable agency search usually begins with the public records officer for the agency or a records coordinator for a department of the agency deciding where the records are likely to be and who is likely to know where they are. One of the most important parts of an adequate search is to decide how wide the search will be. If the agency is small, it might be appropriate to initially ask all agency employees and officials if they have responsive records. If the agency is larger, the agency may choose to initially ask only the staff of the department or departments of an agency most likely to have the records. For example, a request for records showing or discussing payments on a public works project might initially be directed to all staff in the finance and public works departments if those departments are deemed most likely to have the responsive documents, even though other departments may have copies or alternative versions of the same documents. Meanwhile, other departments that may have documents should be instructed to preserve their records in case they are later deemed to be necessary to respond to the request. The agency could notify the requestor which departments are being surveyed for the documents so the requestor may suggest other departments.\r\n\r\nIf agency employees or officials are using home computers, personal devices, or personal accounts to conduct agency business, those devices and accounts also need to be searched by the employees or officials who are using them when those devices and accounts may have responsive records. If an agency's contractors performing agency work have responsive public records of an agency as a consequence of the agency's contract, they should also be notified of the records request. It is better to be over inclusive rather than under inclusive when deciding which staff or others should be contacted, but not everyone in an agency needs to be asked if there is no reason to believe he or she has responsive records. An email to staff or agency officials selected as most likely to have responsive records is usually sufficient. Such an email also allows an agency to document whom it asked for records. Documentation of searches is recommended. The courts can consider the reasonableness of an agency's search when considering assessing penalties for an agency's failure to produce records.\u201d\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm writing to let you know that we have an initial installment of records available for you. As requested, public records requests received by our District are being provided in the native format in which they were received. Also as requested, responses between our District and the requestor generated in the course of processing and fulfilling the request, are being provided in their native format. No new or additional redactions have been made to this installment of records, and a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Please note, requests for educational records containing information directly related to specific students under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), that were inadvertently made using the District's public records request email, have been designated as not responsive to your request. Of course please let me know if this is not an accurate understanding of the records you wish to receive.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this initial installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, this installment of records is being provided electronically via a [?Folder icon]  shared file<https://evergreenps-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/eliza_cornelison_evergreenps_org/EqkR4RJDy4hCj-5XFaq3o68B9lVHj2f4lSgm4rosC-Rgyw> that, as requested, is a public link and is not password protected. If you have any trouble accessing, downloading, or saving the records via that link, of course let me know so that we can troubleshoot the issue or get you the records in an alternate way.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our District is authorized by Board Policy 4040<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BM8UJL7C1628/$file/4040%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Revised)%202.28.2020.pdf> and Procedure 4040P<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BXFR9L6C2E74/$file/4040P%20Procedure%20-%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Adopted%202.28.2020).pdf> to request payment for electronic records as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n2. Five cents per every four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloudbased data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nI want to let you know that because the records we're providing you today comprise a comparatively small number of records (93 electronic records), we're able to waive the correspondingly de minimis PRA fees that otherwise would have been chargeable to you, as a pre-payment condition for your receipt of this installment. (That amount would have been $1.15, based on the statutorily-authorized formula of $.05/per every four electronic records; 93 / 4 = 23.25; 23 x $0.05 = $1.15).\r\n\r\nThe possible charge for the remaining records, however, likely will not be so de minimis that we could waive charges.  So, please be prepared that we likely will be asking that you pre-pay before we'll be able to provide you future installments.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing. Otherwise, in transmitting a partial installment production of this sort, we are also required by public disclosure law to provide you the date by which we estimate we'll be able to provide you our next installment of responsive records.  In that regard, we're estimating you should not expect to receive our next installment toward fulfillment of your request for 30 business days, measured from today's date, on or before March 1, 2022. As explained in my previous email, the time needed to process each installment is due to the differences in availability of staff needed to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other high-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our respective Districts' abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and protecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing or about any other aspect of our processing of your request as we proceed to work towards fulfilling it, of course do not hesitate to let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

As requested, public records requests received by our District are being provided in the native format in which they were received. Also as requested, responses between our District and the requestor generated in the course of processing and fulfilling the request, are being provided in their native format. No new or additional redactions have been made to this installment of records, and a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this initial installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, this installment of records is being provided electronically via a [?Folder icon]  shared file<https://evergreenps-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/eliza_cornelison_evergreenps_org/EqkR4RJDy4hCj-5XFaq3o68B9lVHj2f4lSgm4rosC-Rgyw> that, as requested, is a public link and is not password protected. If you have any trouble accessing, downloading, or saving the records via that link, of course let me know so that we can troubleshoot the issue or get you the records in an alternate way.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our District is authorized by Board Policy 4040<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BM8UJL7C1628/$file/4040%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Revised)%202.28.2020.pdf> and Procedure 4040P<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BXFR9L6C2E74/$file/4040P%20Procedure%20-%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Adopted%202.28.2020).pdf> to request payment for electronic records as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n2. Five cents per every four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloudbased data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nI want to let you know that because the records we're providing you today comprise a comparatively small number of records (56 electronic records), we're able to waive the correspondingly de minimis PRA fees that otherwise would have been chargeable to you, as a pre-payment condition for your receipt of this installment.\r\n\r\nThe possible charge for the remaining records, however, likely will not be so de minimis that we could waive charges.  So, please be prepared that we likely will be asking that you pre-pay before we'll be able to provide you future installments.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing. Otherwise, in transmitting a partial installment production of this sort, we are also required by public disclosure law to provide you the date by which we estimate we'll be able to provide you our next installment of responsive records.  In that regard, we're estimating you should not expect to receive our next installment toward fulfillment of your request for 35 business days, measured from today's date, on or before April 15, 2022. As explained in my previous email, the time needed to process each installment is due to the differences in availability of staff needed to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other high-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our respective Districts' abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and protecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing or about any other aspect of our processing of your request as we proceed to work towards fulfilling it, of course do not hesitate to let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

As requested, public records requests received by our District are being provided in the native format in which they were received. Also as requested, responses between our District and the requestor generated in the course of processing and fulfilling the request, are being provided in their native format. No new or additional redactions have been made to this installment of records, and a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Please note, a few emails in this installment were not uploading correctly. Those emails have been converted to pdfs, and the metadata has been provided via an Excel spreadsheet titled \"Muckrock Metadata - Fourth Installment\", included in the folder linked below.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this initial installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, this installment of records is being provided electronically via a shared file<https://evergreenps-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/eliza_cornelison_evergreenps_org/EgxRX62Z3RxInI4_Rbp-t8oBR3o_RwO_urbI8JnNhUSGGw?e=8mGrSZ> that, as requested, is a public link and is not password protected. If you have any trouble accessing, downloading, or saving the records via that link, of course let me know so that we can troubleshoot the issue or get you the records in an alternate way.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our District is authorized by Board Policy 4040<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BM8UJL7C1628/$file/4040%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Revised)%202.28.2020.pdf> and Procedure 4040P<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BXFR9L6C2E74/$file/4040P%20Procedure%20-%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Adopted%202.28.2020).pdf> to request payment for electronic records as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n2. Five cents per every four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloudbased data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nI want to let you know that because the records we're providing you today comprise a comparatively small number of records (61 electronic records), we're able to waive the correspondingly de minimis PRA fees that otherwise would have been chargeable to you, as a pre-payment condition for your receipt of this installment.\r\n\r\nThe possible charge for the remaining records, however, likely will not be so de minimis that we could waive charges.  So, please be prepared that we likely will be asking that you pre-pay before we'll be able to provide you future installments.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing. Otherwise, in transmitting a partial installment production of this sort, we are also required by public disclosure law to provide you the date by which we estimate we'll be able to provide you our next installment of responsive records.  In that regard, we're estimating you should not expect to receive our next installment toward fulfillment of your request for 20 business days, measured from today's date, on or before June 24, 2022. As explained in my previous email, the time needed to process each installment is due to the differences in availability of staff needed to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other high-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our respective Districts' abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and protecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing or about any other aspect of our processing of your request as we proceed to work towards fulfilling it, of course do not hesitate to let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nI'm writing to let you know that we have another installment of records available for you. As you know, we provided previous installments at no cost due to the District's waiver or the de minimis Public Records Act (PRA) fee associated with those installments. However, as was previously explained to you, further installments would likely exceed an amount that we could consider de minimis and waive the charges. The next installment consists of 3,694 hard-copy pages. Under the PRA, pre-payment of $.10/page, or $369.40, is required to scan those records for processing and production of electronic copies to you. This amount does exceed the de minimis threshold.\r\n\r\nYou can make that $369.40 payment by mailing a check, money order, or similar form of payment made payable to \"Evergreen Public Schools,\" addressed to me as follows:\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\nAttn: Public Records Fees\r\nP.O. Box 8910\r\nVancouver, WA 98668\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may make that payment in person at our District Office, located at 13413 NE LeRoy Haagen Memorial Drive, Vancouver, WA 98684 on any non-holiday weekday. However, I suggest calling ahead to make sure the office is open to receive your payment. The best number to call is (360) 604-4049.\r\n\r\nOnce we receive payment, we will then be authorized by the PRA to scan the copies for you. The scanning process will not take long. However, those scanned copies will need to be reviewed for exempt material under the PRA and redaction of the same. This review will likely take considerable time, given the number of records. We estimate this review-redaction work will take approximately sixty days to complete once we receive the pre-payment required as outlined above.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that we are required to allow you a thirty-day time frame to make the pre-payment as outlined above, measured from the date of this email. A failure to receive such payment from a requester within that time frame permits us to consider their request abandoned and close it.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing or any other aspect of the processing of your request as we work towards fulfilling it, please do not hesitate to let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

Please drop from this request anything other than production of electronic documents. When the electronic documents have been produced this request can be closed.\"\r\n\r\nAs requested, public record requests received by our District are being provided in the native format in which they were received. Also as requested, responses between our District and the requestor generated in the course of processing and fulfilling the request, are being provided in their native format. Please note, the emails in this installment were not uploading correctly. Those emails have been converted to pdfs, and the metadata has been provided via an Excel spreadsheet titled \"Muckrock Metadata - Eleventh Installment\", included in the folder linked below.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, this installment of records is being provided electronically via a shared file<https://evergreenps-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/eliza_cornelison_evergreenps_org/EqkR4RJDy4hCj-5XFaq3o68B9lVHj2f4lSgm4rosC-Rgyw> that, as requested, is a public link and is not password protected. If you have any trouble accessing, downloading, or saving the records via that link, of course let me know so that we can troubleshoot the issue or get you the records in an alternate way.\r\n\r\nA detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable, and I do need to briefly provide you information as to all additional records that I redacted in the course of fulfilling your request.\r\n\r\nAdditional redactions were made to some of the records included in the\"2.2020\", \"6.11.2021\", \"6.17.2021\" and \"9.2021\" folders of this installment. In that regard, at RCW 42.56.250(6) that statutory exemption-to-public disclosure protects against revealing the identities of complainants, other accusers, or witnesses as to alleged events of the sort that were investigated in the above folders, and who were identified as such in the materials compiled in the investigations. So, to the extent the identities of such persons could be determined by a reader of the originals of the attached records, then that personally-identifying content, as to those persons, was obscured from your ability to read it in the attached copies of those originals. Those redactions were made by our imposition of bright blue electronic redaction boxes (i.e., ___________), with all or part of the following phrase overwritten on each such box in black typeface: \"RCW 42.56.250(6)\".\r\n\r\nRedactions made under the exemption of that statute are, however, conditional, by the statute's terms. In that regard, each such accuser/complaint and witness has a right to elect that instead, the content that identifies him or her be revealed to you, as it exists in the originals of these records.  So, we have advised each such person of his/her right to make that election. As of fourteen days from today's date,  if and to the extent any of those persons advises me that s/he does consent to having his/her name/initials, as they appear in the records, disclosed to you, we will then re-produce these same records to you, but with reversal of the de-identifying redactions we've made for those persons, such that you would then be able to read their identities. So even though we've now provided you a copy of every record responsive to your request, we cannot formally consider your request closed for another two weeks. If we need to make the sort of supplemental re-production to you that I've described, then you will receive it at that time.\n",

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Including any attachments or related forms transmitted as attachments or embedded in responsive email messages.\"\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate the effort that has gone into locating and providing some responsive records, the documents provided only constitute a small portion of the records that were likely processed during the requested timeframe. Additionally, certain documents have been withheld, but there is no information provided about the nature of these documents or why they were withheld.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that you provide more information about the documents that have been withheld and the basis for their withholding. Specifically, please provide the reason why disclosure of these documents \"would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" under New York State Public Officers Law \u00a787(2)(b), and the basis for withholding any documents as \"inter-agency or intra-agency materials\" under \u00a787(2)(g).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I believe that there may be additional responsive records that were not provided in the partial response. In particular, an email within the provided documents mentions the existence of an electronic form to submit vaccine redistribution information. Therefore, I request that the scope of my original FOIL request be expanded to include any and all completed electronic Notice of Redistribution of Vaccine Between Location forms and CDC Redistribution Agreements, and related communications, for the same time period.",

        "communication": "I am writing to appeal the response provided to my Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request of 6/28/2022, in which I requested any and all emails to or from CovidVaccineRedistribution@health.ny.gov, including any attachments or related forms transmitted as attachments or embedded in responsive email messages, since 1/1/2018.\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate the efforts made by the Records Access Office (RAO) to respond to my request, I am concerned about the delays and gaps in the information provided. It has been over six months since my initial request, and the RAO's response only included a single email thread with one edge case that does not reflect the scope of my original request. I believe that this information is critical to my request, and I kindly request that the RAO conduct a thorough search for any and all responsive records related to this matter.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the RAO in the current case has cited a high volume of FOIL requests as one of the reasons for the delay in responding to the request. While this may be a legitimate factor, it is also important for agencies to have adequate staffing and resources to handle FOIL requests in a timely manner. I respectfully request that the RAO make every effort to provide a comprehensive response without further delay.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I noticed that some of the records provided have been redacted or withheld under New York State Public Officers Law \u00a787(2)(b) and \u00a787(2)(g). While I understand that certain information may be exempt from disclosure, I request that the RAO provide a more detailed explanation as to why these records were withheld and what specific information was redacted. Specifically, please provide the reason why disclosure of these records \"would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" under \u00a787(2)(b), and the basis for withholding any documents as \"inter-agency or intra-agency materials\" under \u00a787(2)(g).\r\n\r\nLastly, I would like to clarify the scope of my original FOIL request. Specifically, I request that the RAO locate and provide any and all completed electronic Notice of Redistribution of Vaccine Between Location forms and CDC Redistribution Agreements, and related communications, for the same time period as my original request. I believe that this information is responsive to my original request and should have been included in the RAO's initial response.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.",

With racial equity as a central component of safety and security planning, it is imperative that all school safety and security staff not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.\"\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.\tProvide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3.\tProvide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nNote: If your agency chooses not to produce the requested records in reverse chronological order as requested, and/or chooses to sandbag this request by dribbling out a few records per installment every 6 months (tee-hee), you can expect a separate targeted public records request for each line item by year - submitted via multiple members of the public, multiple times until the requested records are timely produced. This simple three part multi year request would then become twelve (12) separate public records requests. If your agency would prefer 12 separate individual requests, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

We are responding to a request that you sent to an email box in our District that is not used to receive or respond to public records requests. The email box is not monitored for new requests or requester responses. When you emailed your request, you should have received an automatic reply directing you to this portal or US Mail.\u00a0 We noticed that you did not create a new request, therefore, we created one for you. Please discontinue sending requests and responses to all email boxes in the District. We have set up several ways to receive and respond to public records requests. For more information, login into our website at http://https//www.highlineschools.org/departments/records/public-records. We also received a duplicate request from you Reference # P000443-121322. Would you like to withdrawal one of the duplicate requests? If we do not hear from you through this portal or through US Mail, we will assume that you would like us to process and bill you for both requests. (http://https/www.highlineschools.org/departments/records/public-records) \r\nAll requests are processed though this portal according to our procedures. You indicated that you do not wish to correspond with us through this portal due to the need to create a login and password. We would like to inform you that we have 2 ways of communicating with requesters, though this portal and through U.S, Mail at: Highline Public Schools 15675 Ambaum Blvd. SW, Burien, WA 98166, Attn: Public Records Officer. We will prepare all correspondence through the portal according to our procedures. All correspondence that we prepare will be automatically emailed to you. If you do not wish to log into this portal to respond to us, please send all correspondence through US Mail. \r\nThis request will be expensive and time consuming to fulfill due to the large volume of records that you requested.

Responsive documents will be produced in Adobe PDF Format and will be available to you through this portal. If you do not wish to receive the records through this portal, you may pay for the records to be loaded onto a cd. \r\nYou requested the following documents: \r\n\"December 8, 2022 \r\nThis is a follow up to a previous request: \r\nHello, \r\nSorry if for some reason the same public records request was inadvertently sent twice. This is not a \"bot\" request. Regardless, I will resubmit the request dated today 12-8-21. \r\nHighline Public Schools District \r\nWashington Public Records Act Office \r\n15675 Ambaum Blvd. SW \r\nBurien, WA 98166 \r\nvia email: publicrecordsrquest@highlineschools.org \r\nDecember 8, 2022 \r\nHIGHLINE PUBLIC SCHOOLS DISTRICT \u2013 (2021) Request for a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the District including the District Responses for the year 2021 \r\nTo Whom It May Concern: \r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records: \r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021. \r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2021 can be excluded from this request. \r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS \r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link. \r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service. \r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records. \r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\" \r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute. \r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT \r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production. \r\nFEES \r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) \r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included. \r\nEXEMPTION LOGS \r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld. \r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION \r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here: \r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhighline-public-schools-district-29082%252Fhighline-public-schools-district-2021-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-the-district-responses-for-the-year-2021-137279%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicrecordsrequest%252540highlineschools.org&url_auth_token=AAEh8PlgY5XbjNfC97GhukhAOHg%3A1p0qlA%3AH2hJnmaE4eGc1tD_9zUsP0HpEuziWHbM0lumVvLyDow \r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter: \r\nCVXKBXMV \r\nFiled via MuckRock.com \r\nE-mail (Preferred): 137279-25427516@requests.muckrock.com \r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS \r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note): \r\nMuckRock News \r\nDEPT MR 137279 \r\n263 Huntington Ave \r\nBoston, MA 02115 \r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

Explain in detail with full legal justification your calculation of $139.00 for fees for this public records request. \r\n\r\nI cannot find any reference to a fee schedule for electronic public records anywhere in your HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY https://www.highlineschools.org/about/board-policies/series-4000. I also cannot find any HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY statement declaring the reason your agency does not calculate actual costs.\r\n\r\nPlease send me a copy of or provide a link to the HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY declaring the reason your agency does not calculate actual costs of producing electronic public records in accordance with the legally required statement of factors and manner used to determine the actual costs - RCW 42.56.070. As you know, any statement of costs and/or any fee schedule adopted by your agency must of course be publicly published. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(a).\r\n\r\nFurther, a statement of costs may be adopted by your agency only after providing notice and public hearing RCW 42.56.070 (7). Of course, your agency may not be required to calculate the actual costs it charges for providing public records if it has published rules or regulations declaring the reasons for doing so would be unduly burdensome. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(b).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a copy of the HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY documents establishing actual costs or in the alternative, the public policy documents declaring that the reason for not calculating actual costs is because it would be unduly burdensome for your agency. I also need a copy of your publicly posted alternative fee schedule previously established as public policy by your agency.\r\n\r\nNote I am requesting HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY records establishing fees. I do note that a fee schedule is posted on your website, however this website fee schedule is not adopted public policy.\r\n\r\nPlease provide HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT ADOPTED PUBLIC POLICY regarding public records fees and the reason these fees are not based on actual costs. \r\n\r\nIf your agency has no HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT ADOPTED PUBLIC POLICY regarding fees and actual costs for public records, I would suggest you waive all fees in this public records request.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nNote: your agency is required to communicate via email. As the HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICER, your agency email address is michelle.terry@highlineschools.org. I have been communicating with you via this email address. \r\n",

We previously provided you with website links where you can find the responsive records. There are no other records to provide to you. \nThe following is what you requested: \nMarch 6, 2023 \nThis is a follow up to request number P000442-121322: \n03-06-23 \nvia email to Highline Public Schools District Public Records Officer Michelle Terry <michelle.terry@highlineschools.org> \nHello Ms. Terry, \nThank you for your preliminary cost estimate. \nI have some concerns regarding how you have calculated costs and fees in this public records request. \nYour preliminary cost estimate of $139.00 are not \"actual costs\" per statute RCW 42.56.070. Explain in detail with full legal justification your calculation of $139.00 for fees for this public \nrecords request. \nI cannot find any reference to a fee schedule for electronic public records anywhere in your HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY \nhttps://www.highlineschools.org/about/board-policies/series-4000. I also cannot find any HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY statement declaring the reason your agency \ndoes not calculate actual costs. \nPlease send me a copy of or provide a link to the HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY declaring the reason your agency does not calculate actual costs of producing \nelectronic public records in accordance with the legally required statement of factors and manner used to determine the actual costs - RCW 42.56.070. As you know, any statement of costs \nand/or any fee schedule adopted by your agency must of course be publicly published. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(a). \nFurther, a statement of costs may be adopted by your agency only after providing notice and public hearing RCW 42.56.070 (7). Of course, your agency may not be required to calculate the \nactual costs it charges for providing public records if it has published rules or regulations declaring the reasons for doing so would be unduly burdensome. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(b). \nPlease provide a copy of the HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY documents establishing actual costs or in the alternative, the public policy documents declaring that the \nreason for not calculating actual costs is because it would be unduly burdensome for your agency. I also need a copy of your publicly posted alternative fee schedule previously established as \npublic policy by your agency. \nNote I am requesting HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC POLICY records establishing fees. I do note that a fee schedule is posted on your website, however this website fee schedule \nis not adopted public policy. \nPlease provide HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT ADOPTED PUBLIC POLICY regarding public records fees and the reason these fees are not based on actual costs. \nIf your agency has no HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT ADOPTED PUBLIC POLICY regarding fees and actual costs for public records, I would suggest you waive all fees in this public \nrecords request. \nThank you. \nNote: your agency is required to communicate via email. As the HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICER, your agency email address is \nmichelle.terry@highlineschools.org. I have been communicating with you via this email address. \nView request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here: \nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhighlinepublic- \nschools-district-29082%252Fhighline-public-schools-district-2021-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-thedistrict- \nresponses-for-the-year-2021- \n137279%252F%253Femail%253Dmichelle.terry%252540highlineschools.org&url_auth_token=AAEh8PlgY5XbjNfC97GhukhAOHg%3A1pZLC8%3A3zhwUpE5JpTkqNXEgbFtEvXId8Bh- \nSG624EUMLF7_oc \nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter: \nCVXKBXMV \nAttachments: \n\u2022 PUBLIC_POLICY_4040_ACCESS_TO_DISTRICT_RECORDS_3-6-2023.png \nFiled via MuckRock.com \nE-mail (Preferred): 137279-25427516@requests.muckrock.com \nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS \nFor mailed responses, please address (see note): \nMuckRock News \nDEPT MR 137279 \n263 Huntington Ave \nBoston, MA 02115 \nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests. \nAlso note that improperly addressed (i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the department number) requests might be returned as undeliverable. \n--- \nOn March 6, 2023: \nSubject: [Records Center] Public Records Request :: P000442-121322 \n--- Please respond above this line --- \nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of December 13, 2022., Reference # P000442-121322. Amended Letter Re: Cost Estimate- Amended to correct down payment amount to $13.90 \nRequester 137279, \nWe are writing to provide you with a preliminary cost estimate. After reviewing the public records requests for the year 2021, we estimate that there are approximately 4460 records. The \nupload cost is $55.00 calculated at .05 cents for every four records and the cost for the CD 's and mailing the records in installments is $84.00. The total preliminary estimated cost to you is \n$139.00. The cost of the CD and mailing has been added because you indicated that you do not wish to login to this portal to receive the responsive records. An invoice is attached with \npayment instructions. Please pay 10% down, $13.90. The down payment is due immediately. After we receive your down payment, we will begin notifying third parties as we prepare each \ninstallment. After third parties are notified for the first installment, we will bill you and the records will be released to you. \nReview this letter\u00a0 within thirty (30) days. Pursuant to RCW 42.56.120, \u201cIf an agency makes a request available on a partial or installment basis, the agency may charge for each part of the request as it is provided.\u00a0 If an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\u201d \nPlease note that RCW 42.56.070 provides in part: \n(8) This chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency, the office of the secretary of the senate, or the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives to give, sell or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes, and agencies, the office of the secretary of the senate, and the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives shall not do so unless specifically authorized or directed by law..... \nLet us know if you have any questions. \nSincerely, \nMichelle Terry \nCertified Public Records Officer \nPolicy & Strategy \nTo monitor the progress or update this request please log into the Records Center (https://highlineschool.mycusthelp.com/WEBAPP/_rs/RequestEdit.aspx?rid=486&coid=)\n",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record.

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. If you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-338-1050 or by email at Erinstewart@cfjj.org. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Stewart\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Code \u00a76250 et. seq.) provides that CDPH may extend the response period for up to 14 calendar days should it be necessary to search for records located at off-site facilities or if the request involves a voluminous amount of records.\u00a0 We will notify you within 10 days of receipt of your request if a 14-day extension is necessary.\u00a0 If fees are involved, CDPH will need to collect the fees before releasing the records.\u00a0 However, there is typically no fee for records released electronically through the Public Records Center Portal. \r\nThe 10- and 14-day response periods are to allow CDPH time to determine how long it will take to disclose the requested records.\u00a0 Depending on the number of records requested or other factors, a response may take longer.\u00a0 CDPH will do its best to provide documents on a rolling basis as they become available and to keep you informed as to the timing and type of records to be released. \r\nPlease visit the CDPH Public Records Center Portal\u00a0to monitor request progress, communicate with CDPH staff processing your request and to submit future requests.\r\nCalifornia Department of Public Health",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and communications responsive to Dr. Harry Charles Steinmetz (December 8, 1898 - February 15, 1981). Dr. Steinmetz was Professor Emeritus of Psychology at San Diego State University. Between 1942 and 1980 the Federal Bureau of Investigation monitored the actions of Dr. Steinmetz as part of an ongoing program devoted to investigating suspected communists. Dr. Steinmetz sent a Freedom of Information Act request for his file in the seventies, resulting in his receiving 934 pages of documents in or about 1978.\r\n\r\nI am requesting all responsive records issued previously to Dr. Steinmetz and any that may not have been released before his death. As verification of Dr. Steinmetz's prior FOIPA release, I am attaching correspondence between Dr. Steinmetz and the Bureau. First is a February 11, 1977 response letter from the Bureau identifying 658 pages of documents responsive to Dr. Steinmetz, and second is a response to an appeal made by Dr. Steinmetz identifying an additional 276 pages of Bureau documents. These two page counts total 934 pages of documents. This correspondence can be found in the special collections archive at San Diego State University, under Dr. Steinmetz personal effects and papers (MS-0305).\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Dr. Steinmetz's privacy, as he passed away in 1981. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. I have attached a reproduction of Dr. Steinmetz's obituary, taken from the The Los Angeles Times, as verification. As this is information the Bureau has released to other parties, there should be no further concerns over making this information public.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Dear Records Custodian,\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (MCL 15.231 et. seq.) for documents that detail how your community\u2019s water system functions, including details on utility terminations, restorations, and rates.\r\n\r\nAs context for this request, I am requesting these records on behalf of the People\u2019s Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization that advocates for equitable access, protection, and affordability of utility services, and water conservation. We are filing similar requests for information with many other Michigan water utilities in collaboration with residents, community leaders, and local officials to better support the needs of low-income customers. If any of this information is publicly available and accessible, please send a link to the webpage where it is located. Please reply to this request via email. If you have any question or concern about this request, please call Cass Charrette at 248-980-1191.\r\n\r\nWhen possible, please provide the requested quantitative data in an Excel spreadsheet or other native digital format (such as CSV files).\r\n\r\n1. A copy of any data and documents that list the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service terminated starting January 1, 2019 to date of the submission of the FOIA, the reason for the termination, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this data is produced in another format, such as written logs or summary reports, please provide a copy of that instead. If your agency has a policy that home address information is exempt from FOIA, please provide this data at the street level.\r\n\r\n2. Any documents describing and listing the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service restored starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, following a disconnection. If this data is included in the same data set as Item 6, you may provide that full data set in lieu of processing this element separately.\r\n\r\n3. A copy of any existing, regularly generated reports that include the total amount of water and wastewater customer arrearages, number of customers in arrears, and median amount of arrearages per customer, and number of customers subject to potential service disconnection due to arrears by customer class (e.g., residential, non-profit, commercial, industrial) starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA.\r\n\r\n4. A copy of a list of referrals the utility/water system/municipality sent to the tax assessor to place a tax lien on properties due to non-payment of any water or sewer bill, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this information is stored in a summary database, you may provide that database.\r\n\r\n5. Any documents describing or listing the addresses of residential customer accounts that have been enrolled in and have been discharged from the Great Lakes Water Authority\u2019s Water Residential Assistance Program, and the reason for such removal or discharge, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA.\r\n\r\nAs I am requesting these records as a representative of People\u2019s Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization, and am doing so in the public interest, I request a waiver of fees. The analysis and release of these materials will contribute significantly to public understanding of water affordability issues in the tri-county area.\r\n\r\nI will expect a response within 5 business days as provided by law. If my request is denied in whole or in part, I expect a detailed justification for withholding the records. I also request any segregable portions that are not exempt to be disclosed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for reducing the burden of my request, please reach out and we are happy to discuss.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPeople\u2019s Water Board Coalition",

RESPONSE : The CPS FOIA office has reviewed your request with the CPS Law Department and the information you seek is not comprehensively tracked in the manner requested, specifically, settlements and lawsuits by school. However, in the spirit of cooperation, a search was conducted and responsive documents were located. Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests This request would require original research, analysis of records, and the creation of a new record to answer a question which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. This process is not required according to guidance provided by 5 ILCS 140/2(c). 5 ILCS 140/1, Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28, 32 (4 th Dist. 1989), and Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Additionally, under Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Further, section 1 of FOIA states in part: \u201cThis Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\u201d In accordance with Section 1 of the Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer your questions or prepare researched records on your behalf in response to your request. In the case of a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Ana Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",
