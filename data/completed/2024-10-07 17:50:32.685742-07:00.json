This would include but not be limited to reimbursements for mileage, gas, airfare, lodging, etc.  \r\n\r\nDue to novel coronavirus emergency which requires so much teleworking in your agency as publicly stated repeatedly to this website, I think an overwhelming public interest exists in your spending and migration patterns. \r\n\r\nYour agency has expense disclosure transparency requirements based on The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act FFATA, and The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014, DATA in addition to FOIA. \r\n\r\nAs we have previously discussed sometimes these records are held within the Financial Management Division.  \r\n\r\nBut please search any and all available indices/records areas that would be likely to contain the records sought. \r\n\r\nPlease produce the records in EFOIA Format .pdf document preferred.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact FOIA/PA Unit representative Fantasia L.

        "communication": "Dear William Fernandes:\r\n\u200b\r\n            This e-mail responds to your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) request dated April 2, 2022, received by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), FOIA/PA Unit, seeking access to DEA records.  Your request has been opened and assigned the following case number: 23-00303-F.  Please include this case number when communicating with this office.\r\n\r\nYour request as written does not meet the requirements of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(3)(A), since they do not reasonably describe records.  The Department of Justice rules, contained at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.3, provide that \u201cyou must describe the records in enough detail to enable department personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort\u201d and when possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought such as the date, title or name, author and subject matter of the record.  These specifics are important to determine the extent and scope of the search, and to determine the records that are responsive.  DEA can make certain presumptions to overcome some of the deficiencies in your request, but not all of them.\r\n\r\nTo retrieve the information that you may be seeking requires more specificity.  Under the FOIA, an agency is not required to conduct research.  DEA maintains several types of records and records systems (i.e., regulatory, personnel, investigative, etc.).  For example, in your letter, you are requesting Any and all expense records for travel into the State of Nevada for the period 2020.,\u201d yet you have not specified a particular DEA office that you wish searched; or the type of record that would be responsive to your request.  Be advised that DEA has 239 Domestic Offices in 23 Divisions throughout the United States, and 92 foreign offices in 69 countries, and more than 150 Headquarters Offices.  Since your description did not limit the search to a specific office or area, a vast majority of DEA offices would be tasked to conduct a search of their respective offices for any responsive records pertaining to the subject of your request.  As such, your request is overly broad and burdensome.\r\n\r\nPlease specify the following:\r\n\r\n  1.  Clarify the type of travel (TDY and/or Extended TDY travel)\r\n  2.

The FBI and OIG both made FOIA productions about their spending for travel into the Silver State of Nevada.  The DEA offices continues to refuse to produce records in relation to spending and this was during the COVID peak.  \r\n\r\nAt this time the DEA was pandering to other law enforcement agencies (in CA) offering assistance to locate people, which is an advertisement that it did not have enough of its own work to do.  \r\n\r\nThe DOJ OIP refuses to govern the DEA about this which generally is a corruption indicator. Something in the expenses to be inspected. \r\n\r\nI also requested the OIP Background report, which the agency DEA obstructed and only, sent back a portion which was the appeal submitted.\r\n\r\nI think this agency should be defunded and its duties passed to DHS, CBO, FBI, HHS. \r\n\r\nRecords are available publicly here:\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/expenses-127054/",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nI hereby appeal the action of Jeremy Prince (herein referred to as \"Mr. Prince\") of the Graves County Sheriff's Office on April 20th, 2021. \r\n\r\nThis appeal is made pursuant to the Kentucky Open Records Act.\r\n\r\nStatement\u00a0of Facts:\r\n\r\nOn April 13th, 2021, Mr. Hayden Hodges (herein referred to as \"Mr. Hodges\") filed an open records request with the Graves County Sheriff's Office for a police report and body-worn camera video regarding\u00a0a DUI arrest.\r\n\r\nOn April 19th, 2021, Mr. Prince responded via email to Mr. Hodges and provided a copy of the police report regarding the incident and provided a copy of KRS 189A.100. On the same day, Mr. Hodges responded stating that the statute only covers field sobriety\u00a0videos. It does not exempt the remaining parts of the incident (booking, transport, search, etc).\r\n\r\nOn April 19th, 2021, Mr. Prince responded to this correspondence\u00a0and then stated that the\u00a0department was withholding the records because of an active criminal investigation.\r\n\r\nStatement of Appeal and Relief Requested:\r\n\r\nI appeal the action of Mr. Prince for the following reasons.\r\n\r\nReason #1:\r\n\r\nKRS 189A.100 only exempts\u00a0field sobriety\u00a0videos and not other parts of the video. Pursuant\u00a0to KRS 61.878(4), the agency is required to provide other parts of a record, even if one part is exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nRelief Requested #1:\r\n\r\nI request that you find the department violated the law when they refused to produce the\u00a0redacted video which does not contain the exempt information. The agency is required to\u00a0produce these records pursuant to KRS 61.878(4).\r\n\r\nReason #2:\r\n\r\nKRS 61.878(1)(h) only exempts criminal records that would \"harm the agency by revealing the identity of informants not otherwise known or by premature release of information to be used in a prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication\". The agency has not presented evidence to show that there are any informants for this case or if the release of the video would harm the agency.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the records are not exempt from the other part of the statute because the law enforcement action at hand is not prospective because the charges have already been filed against the defendant. This statute does not exempt documents regarding an active court case.\r\n\r\nRelief Requested #2:\r\n\r\nI request that you find the department has no right to withhold the information requested under this statute\u00a0because they have not presented sufficient evidence to show that the records are part of a \"prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication\".\r\n\r\nI additionally request that you find the department violated\u00a0the law when they refused to produce the redacted video.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that pursuant to the Kentucky Open Records Act, I retain all rights to pursue litigation against the agency.\r\n\r\nPlease reply to this appeal as required by law.\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this appeal as required by law.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.\r\n\r\nRespectfully\u00a0Submitted,\r\nMr. Hayden Hodges\r\n\r\nCC: Mr. Jeremy Prince (w/o enclosures)\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\n1 -- Communication Regarding Record Request\r\n2 -- Police Report Regarding Incident",

        "communication": "Mr. Prince,\r\n\r\nAn appeal has been filed. You are hereby notified by the correspondence enclosed herein.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMr. Hayden Hodges\r\n\r\nAppeal:\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nI hereby appeal the action of Jeremy Prince (herein referred to as \"Mr. Prince\") of the Graves County Sheriff's Office on April 20th, 2021.\r\n\r\nThis appeal is made pursuant to the Kentucky Open Records Act.\r\n\r\nStatement of Facts:\r\n\r\nOn April 13th, 2021, Mr. Hayden Hodges (herein referred to as \"Mr. Hodges\") filed an open records request with the Graves County Sheriff's Office for a police report and body-worn camera video regarding a DUI arrest.\r\n\r\nOn April 19th, 2021, Mr. Prince responded via email to Mr. Hodges and provided a copy of the police report regarding the incident and provided a copy of KRS 189A.100. On the same day, Mr. Hodges responded stating that the statute only covers field sobriety videos. It does not exempt the remaining parts of the incident (booking, transport, search, etc).\r\n\r\nOn April 19th, 2021, Mr. Prince responded to this correspondence and then stated that the department was withholding the records because of an active criminal investigation.\r\n\r\nStatement of Appeal and Relief Requested:\r\n\r\nI appeal the action of Mr. Prince for the following reasons.\r\n\r\nReason #1:\r\n\r\nKRS 189A.100 only exempts field sobriety videos and not other parts of the video. Pursuant to KRS 61.878(4), the agency is required to provide other parts of a record, even if one part is exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nRelief Requested #1:\r\n\r\nI request that you find the department violated the law when they refused to produce the redacted video which does not contain the exempt information. The agency is required to produce these records pursuant to KRS 61.878(4).\r\n\r\nReason #2:\r\n\r\nKRS 61.878(1)(h) only exempts criminal records that would \"harm the agency by revealing the identity of informants not otherwise known or by premature release of information to be used in a prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication\". The agency has not presented evidence to show that there are any informants for this case or if the release of the video would harm the agency.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the records are not exempt from the other part of the statute because the law enforcement action at hand is not prospective because the charges have already been filed against the defendant. This statute does not exempt documents regarding an active court case.\r\n\r\nRelief Requested #2:\r\n\r\nI request that you find the department has no right to withhold the information requested under this statute because they have not presented sufficient evidence to show that the records are part of a \"prospective law enforcement action or administrative adjudication\".\r\n\r\nI additionally request that you find the department violated the law when they refused to produce the redacted video.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that pursuant to the Kentucky Open Records Act, I retain all rights to pursue litigation against the agency.\r\n\r\nPlease reply to this appeal as required by law.\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this appeal as required by law.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.\r\n\r\nRespectfully Submitted,\r\nMr. Hayden Hodges\r\n\r\nCC: Mr. Jeremy Prince (w/o enclosures)\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\n1 -- Communication Regarding Record Request\r\n2 -- Police Report Regarding Incident",

The responsive records are required for each DHS component FOIA office by the 2/9/2005 Chief Privacy Officer memo, available here: https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/priv_cpo_cabinet_report_submission_guidelines_20050209_1.pdf\r\n\r\nPlease use the same search methodology as the one used in response to our prior FOIA request, designated 2022-HQFO-01117. By way of example, DHS PRIV\u2019s search responsive to that request produced these records: https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23685324/dhs-significant-foia-activity-2022-hqfo-01117.pdf.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files, memos, emails and other records mentioning or describing John \"Sonny\"\r\n    Franzese Sr. (February 6, 1917 \u2013 February 24, 2020), who was an\r\n    Italian-American mobster who was a longtime member of the Colombo crime\r\n    family.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear FOIL Appeals Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing in regard to Freedom of Information Law request sent to the City on 01/11/2023 (attached.)\r\n\r\nPlease consider this a formal appeal under Public Officers Law 89(4)(A) of the constructive denial of that request. I say constructive denial because the City has simply failed to respond in a timely manner to my request.\r\n\r\nIn a FOIL request I submitted on 01/11/2023 I asked for \u201cAny external communications with email addresses ending in @5wpr.com\u201d\r\n\r\nIt has been more than 18 months. To date, I have received neither the records sought nor a denial of the request. I received recognition of my FOIL request  but have not received further communication, the requested documents, or a denial. \r\n\r\nThe city's approach to my request is simply unlawful. It is inconsistent with both the language and intent of FOIL.\r\n\r\nAs the state\u2019s Committee on Open Government, tasked with interpreting FOIL matters, has said, under FOIL, \u201can agency cannot engage in one delay after another.\u201d FOIL AO-18008(Feb. 22, 2010). Yet, this is exactly how the city council has responded to my request, sending me only one correspondence.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Public Officers Law 89(3)(a), as amended by the Legislature in 2005, an agency must within five business days of receipt of a written request for records make the record sought available, deny access and give reasons for the denial, or furnish an acknowledgement of receipt and state the approximate date when the request will be dealt with. The statute further specifies that the approximate date for addressing a request on its merits should not exceed 20 business days from the date of the acknowledgement of the receipt of the request. A failure by an agency to conform to this statutorily mandated time frame constitutes a constructive denial. See Public Officers Law 89(4)(a). The statute was written as such to ensure FOIL requestors are not, as here, subjected to endless delays by agencies that choose to open their files to the public (which was precisely why FOIL was passed in the first place).\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Committee on Open Government makes clear that \u201cin the rare situation in which it is found that more than 20 additional business days are needed [to address the merits of a request], the agency may do so, with an explanation of the reason for the delay and an indication of a \u201cdate certain,\u201d a self-imposed deadline by which it will grant access to the records in whole or in part (see regulations of the Committee on Open Government, 21 NYCRR 1401.5). When the date certain is reasonable in consideration of attendant facts and circumstances, the agency would be complying with law. There is no provision that permits agencies to indicate extension after extension.\u201d FOIL AO-18008 (emphasis added). See also FOIL-AO 16095 (Dec. 13, 2007) (noting that \u201cthe amendments [to FOIL] clearly are intended to prohibit agencies from unnecessarily delaying disclosure.\u201d). A series of generic notifications over a period of months saying that a response is forthcoming does not meet this standard under FOIL.\r\n\r\nFurther, as recognized by the New York Court of Appeals, FOIL itself contains \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s own unmistakably broad declaration that \u2026 it is incumbent upon the state and its localities to extend public accountability wherever and whenever feasible.\u201d Westchester Newspapers, Inc. v Kimball, 50 NY2d 575,579 (1980) (emphasis added), quoting Section 84 of FOIL. Therefore, where, as here, records are clearly available to the public under FOIL, or are readily retrievable, there may be no basis for a delay in disclosures.\r\n\r\nAs I know of no grounds in FOIL for the denial of the request, and the city has given none, I ask that this appeal be granted and that the records sought be produced promptly.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nJake Offenhartz\r\nAssociated Press\r\n212 621 1605",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 360 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

How much/many of the documents have been reviewed?\r\n\r\nReceiving no response, on 01/04/2024, I sent the following communication:\r\n\r\nI would like further updates on the status of the request. I am presuming you will *not* need to tell me to narrow the request - it seems that the record reflects you've accepted the terms of my request.\r\n\r\nOn 01/17/2024, still receiving no response, I sent the following communication:\r\n\r\nIf you cannot provide updates on the status of this request except to delay it on February 16, 2024 by two to three months, how should I believe the agency is engaging in good faith?\r\n\r\nIf I - from outside the agency - can ever predict that a deadline like this will be missed, how can the agency claim that it couldn't have forseen any delays, and thus that the February 16, 2024 date is reasonable?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 01/25/2024, STILL receiving no response, I sent the following communication:\r\nHello hello, please update me on the status of this request. How much/many of the documents have been reviewed?\r\n\r\nIs there anything you can forsee which is highly likely to cause the agency to miss the estimated completion date?\r\n\r\n\r\nJust before 1pm on the day of the deadline, the agency sent a communication indicating that my request would not be completed until April 22, 2024.\r\n\r\nAt no point before the deadline did the agency inform me that there was some new and unforeseen factor which might delay the production of records in a way that is (again) unforeseeable before the date of the deadline. This is even after one prior extension and multiple inquiries about the status of the request.\r\n\r\nI appeal on grounds of constructive denial.\r\n\r\nState agencies have every right to take reasonable amounts of time to process and respond to FOIL requests.\r\n\r\nThey even, as the courts have ruled in Gannett Satellite Info. Network, LLC v. N.Y. State Thruway Auth, have a right to delay repeatedly in the event that the volume of FOIL requests is large, given that the delay is reasonable.\r\n\r\nLater in the case of Empire Center for Public Policy v. New York State Department of Health, the courts denied the right of this agency to repeatedly delay the response to a more straightforward request. In that case, it was many months before the request was fulfilled, each time with the request delayed by the same cookie cutter period.\r\n\r\nOn MuckRock, the current average response time for a request to NYSDOH is 140 days.\r\n\r\nIt boggles my mind to think that anybody in the agency might honestly be so unfamiliar with the process that they would be off in their estimate by 6 months or more.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that this request will take at least 6 months to fulfill.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that records access officers are competent at their jobs and intelligent individuals, thus it strains my sense of credulity to accept that delays are so consistently unforseen and unforeseeable to the point where completion dates must routinely and normally be extended. It has further drained my sense of patience in dealing with agencies when the obvious happens.\r\n\r\nI have no qualm with the individual records access officer about this issue. I believe they are merely stuck working with a system that undervalues FOIL, and places overworked employees in a difficult position.\r\n\r\nThat does nothing to detract from the absurdity of an agency that first understaffs the FOIL positions, initially promises completion dates that are short enough to beguile requesters (but are rarely met), and then claims a lack of foresight about the failure to meet self imposed completion dates. Surely Kafka might've mistaken it for an excerpt from his work should he be alive today!\r\n\r\nI am not challenging the right of an agency to take a long time to respond. However, by failing to give the date by which in reality the agency is *actually* likely to produce responsive records, I am deprived of my right to appeal that deadline until after it has been broken.\r\n\r\nI am seeking a deadline by which the agency is highly likely, in its honest and intelligent judgment, to complete the request.",

I appreciate the effort your office is making to review the potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nI understand that the review process can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with a large number of documents. However, I would like to suggest the possibility of a rolling release of records. This approach, where records are provided as they become available, is often encouraged under FOIL, particularly when dealing with large requests. It allows for more timely access to information and can also help to manage the workload of reviewing and redacting documents.\r\n\r\nA rolling release could also benefit your office by breaking down the task into more manageable parts and providing a steady flow of information rather than a large release all at once. This approach is in line with the spirit of FOIL, which aims to promote transparency and public access to information.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your consideration of this suggestion and to receiving the responsive documents. \r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\n",

I understand that the review process can be time-consuming, and I appreciate your efforts in this matter.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to express my concern about the extended completion date. As you may be aware, the Committee on Open Government has advised that an agency should grant or deny access to records as soon as possible, and that a delay in response should be reasonable in consideration of the circumstances of the request.\r\n\r\nGiven the importance of the requested records to public understanding of the COVID-19 vaccine redistribution process, I believe it is in the public interest to expedite this request as much as possible. I would also like to reiterate my request for a rolling release of records, which would allow for more timely access to information.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are no responsive records, I kindly request a certification from the Department of Health stating that a diligent search was conducted. This certification is important to confirm that all potential sources of the requested information were checked.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt response and thank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n",

The extension of the completion date to April 2, 2024, represents an excessive delay that undermines the principles of transparency and timely access to information under the New York Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\nDespite acknowledging the existence of responsive documents, the Department has not provided any interim releases, suggesting a continuous delay without substantive progress. This approach, especially in matters of public health, fails to meet the spirit of FOIL, which is designed to promote public understanding and oversight of government actions.\r\n\r\nI request a reassessment of the timeline for this FOIL request and the immediate release of any already reviewed documents. Such an action would align with the intent of FOIL to ensure prompt public access to government records.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this appeal. I look forward to your prompt response and the timely release of the requested documents.",

This request is governed by the Maryland Public Information Act (\"PIA\"), codified in Sections 4-101 et seq. of the General Provisions Article of the Maryland Code. A request for public information under the PIA must be submitted to the custodian of public records. Md. Code, Gen. Prov., \u00a7 4-202(a). Each governmental entity, including each Baltimore City agency, is the custodian of its own records. See Baltimore City Code, Art. 1 \u00a7 10-1. This response is on behalf of the DOF.\r\n\r\nThe search for the documents you have requested and their review may take more than 10-days, the reasons for which may include the volume of documentation. In any event, we will respond to your request within 30 days. GP \u00a74-203.\r\n\r\nThe PIA allows the government to charge for any time past two hours that it takes to gather, review and redact, if necessary, any documents requested at the rate of the employee performing the work after giving the first two hours labor for free.  Md. Code, Gen. Prov., \u00a7 4-206; accord Md. Public Information Act Compliance Board Opinion 16-05.
