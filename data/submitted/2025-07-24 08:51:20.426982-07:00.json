I don't need every record, and I don't need the names.  I'm just looking for documents that would show me how many people.  For example, if a list exists, I would accept a list in which each name is redacted, which would allow me to ascertain the total number.  Or if notifications were made by letter or email, you could provide me those communications, again with names redacted.  I'm open to other approaches.  Because I am only looking for documents sufficient to show, and because there may not even be any other such people, I request that you do not start by conducting an electronic search, but instead simply contact Ms. Bondi or the appropriate person on her staff to ask whether there have been any such notifications.  If they tell you there have not, I would not ask you to conduct any further searches.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Additionally, the volume of records and the manner in which they are maintained may require time-consuming searches and retrieval efforts. \u00a0Further, as the records maintained by this law enforcement agency are generally sensitive in nature, thorough review of any responsive records is necessary to prevent the disclosure of confidential and/or sensitive information. Finally, this agency processes requests in the order they are received and requests that are particularly voluminous or complex may require additional time to complete. The body worn camera portion of your request will be processed in the order in which it was received.\u00a0 We are currently experiencing a backlog and appreciate your patience in this matter.\u00a0 If the requested footage is located, you will receive correspondence\u00a0via e-mail from no reply@evidence.com . \nPlease note that, pursuant to Article 6 of the Public Officers Law, a charge may be applied to your request, including the actual cost of the medium used to respond to your Freedom of Information Law request and/or other related costs. When responsive records have been identified, you will be informed of any cost and how payment should be made. \nAs we have acknowledged your request, please refrain from submitting duplicate requests for the same records through GovQA. \u00a0If you need a status update on your request, or were asked to resubmit due to an ongoing investigation, please reach out to us. \u00a0To submit additional information or inquire about the status of your request, you can send a message through your GovQA portal account or call us at (518) 464-7100 and select option #4. \nSincerely, \nNew York State Police \n1220 Washington Avenue, Bldg. 22 \nAlbany, NY 12226-2252 \n \nLog into the FOIL Records Access Center to review or update this request.

Your request has been routed to the appropriate staff within Washoe County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashoe County typically processes requests in the order of receipt. The time it takes to respond to a request will vary depending on the complexity of the request and any backlog of requests already pending. A simple request can be processed faster than one that is complex. Simple requests are typically more targeted and seek fewer pages of records. Complex requests typically seek a high volume of material or require additional steps to process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequests for communications require coordination of several departments and review of each record for confidentiality and privilege. Please consider focusing or narrowing the request in such a manner as to maximize expeditious processing. Due to the high volume of public records requests received and the complexity of your request, it is expected that you will receive documents or an update on or before August 21st, 2025.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWashoe311 Public Records Requests&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at Washoe County, NV.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",
