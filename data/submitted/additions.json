The records requested have far-reaching implications for data privacy, employee retention, and litigation exposure. Delayed disclosure of these records would compromise the public\u2019s timely understanding of critical government functioning. As a journalist actively reporting on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Texas Department of Emergency Management, I have a compelling need for expedited access to this information.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
