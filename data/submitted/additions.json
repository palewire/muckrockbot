I am specifically seeking records related to the discovery of two deceased women in the home in March 2016. The types of records I am interested in include: complaints, site investigations, notices of violation (NOVs), return to compliance documentation, and those related to the suspension of the home's license (motions, complaints, summary judgments, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKent Hoover, a citizen of Tennessee, in coordination with Caitlin Downey.",
