The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

This request was rejected on the grounds that I could not demonstrate that disclosure of the requested records to me would constitute a \"significant\" benefit to public knowledge of NASA'a activities. Specifically, my claim was characterized as \"speculative.\" In considering my appeal, I ask whomever it may concern to consider that, in addition to my qualifications as stated in the original request, I am the editor-in-chief of a magazine (currently digital but soon to be in print) called \"Cultural Engineering Studies,\" and I personally contributed an article to this magazine on NASA's relationship to Hollywood--an almost unexplored topic. So it seems arbitrary to conclude that this information will not benefit public awareness in a \"significant\" way. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for considering my appeal,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

The custodian will determine whether responsive records exist, and if so, compile the records for your review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the due date located on the individual \"Request #\" page for an estimate of when your records, if any, will be available.\u00a0This estimated due date may be adjusted depending on the nature of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote also that records may be in active use at this time and therefore not available for immediate review.\u00a0Additionally, in accordance with the Louisiana Public Records Law, the City of New Orleans strives to promptly release all records which contain only public information and are not otherwise exempt from the Public Records Law. The City must balance its commitment to open access with its legal obligation to review public records for such exceptions and exemptions prior to release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that there may be a delay in responding to requests for email. Requests for email must first be sent to the City's IT Department to retrieve the requested emails. The emails must then be examined to determine if there is any material that must be redacted for privacy concerns and otherwise. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the custodian notifies our office that the records have been compiled you will be invoiced by email. Once you pay the invoice, you may download the records. Alternatively, you may schedule a time to review or purchase copies of the records.\u00a0Thank you for your request, and we look forward to working with you to provide public records in a fair and efficient manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nCity of New Orleans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\nReply to this email or sign in to contact City of New Orleans.<br><br>\r\n             <a href=\"https://nola.nextrequest.com/settings?id=1555081\">Change your email settings</a> | <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">Visit our help center</a>",
