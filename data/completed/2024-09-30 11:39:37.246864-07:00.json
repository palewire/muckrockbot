This would include but not be limited to reimbursements for mileage, gas, airfare, lodging, etc.  \r\n\r\nDue to novel coronavirus emergency which requires so much teleworking in your agency as publicly stated repeatedly to this website, I think an overwhelming public interest exists in your spending and migration patterns. \r\n\r\nYour agency has expense disclosure transparency requirements based on The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act FFATA, and The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014, DATA in addition to FOIA. \r\n\r\nAs we have previously discussed sometimes these records are held within the Financial Management Division.  \r\n\r\nBut please search any and all available indices/records areas that would be likely to contain the records sought. \r\n\r\nPlease produce the records in EFOIA Format .pdf document preferred.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWilliam Fernandes",

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact FOIA/PA Unit representative Fantasia L. Hogan-Bassey-Graham at (571) 776-2210 or via e-mail at Fantasia.L.Hogan-Bassey-Graham@dea.gov, our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public.\u00a0 You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

Your request has been opened and assigned the following case number: 23-00303-F.  Please include this case number when communicating with this office.\r\n\r\nYour request as written does not meet the requirements of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(3)(A), since they do not reasonably describe records.  The Department of Justice rules, contained at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.3, provide that \u201cyou must describe the records in enough detail to enable department personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort\u201d and when possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought such as the date, title or name, author and subject matter of the record.  These specifics are important to determine the extent and scope of the search, and to determine the records that are responsive.  DEA can make certain presumptions to overcome some of the deficiencies in your request, but not all of them.\r\n\r\nTo retrieve the information that you may be seeking requires more specificity.  Under the FOIA, an agency is not required to conduct research.  DEA maintains several types of records and records systems (i.e., regulatory, personnel, investigative, etc.).  For example, in your letter, you are requesting Any and all expense records for travel into the State of Nevada for the period 2020.,\u201d yet you have not specified a particular DEA office that you wish searched; or the type of record that would be responsive to your request.  Be advised that DEA has 239 Domestic Offices in 23 Divisions throughout the United States, and 92 foreign offices in 69 countries, and more than 150 Headquarters Offices.  Since your description did not limit the search to a specific office or area, a vast majority of DEA offices would be tasked to conduct a search of their respective offices for any responsive records pertaining to the subject of your request.  As such, your request is overly broad and burdensome.\r\n\r\nPlease specify the following:\r\n\r\n  1.  Clarify the type of travel (TDY and/or Extended TDY travel)\r\n  2.  Verify the timeframe for \u201c2020\u201d (calendar year Jan-December or fiscal year Oct 2019 \u2013 Sept 2020)\r\n  3.  Do you also want the information to include the PCS travel when core employees move?\r\n\r\nTo this end, no further action will be initiated on this request until we are in receipt of the above documentation.  Upon receipt, we will conduct a query of the Investigative Reporting and Filing System (IRFS).  IRFS is the system of records that contains all administrative, general and investigative files compiled by DEA for law enforcement purposes.  If this office does not receive your response within 30 business days, DEA will assume that you do not wish to pursue this matter and your request will be administratively closed.  Please e-mail your response to fantasia.l.hogan-bassey-graham@dea.gov<mailto:fantasia.l.hogan-bassey-graham@dea.gov>.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with DEA\u2019s determination in response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website:  https://www.justice.gov/oip/submit-and-track-request-or-appeal.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request.  If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal.\"\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this email, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300.  Thank you for your patience as we work to complete the processing of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nFantasia Hogan-Bassey-Graham\r\nIBSS Corp.

The DEA offices continues to refuse to produce records in relation to spending and this was during the COVID peak.  \r\n\r\nAt this time the DEA was pandering to other law enforcement agencies (in CA) offering assistance to locate people, which is an advertisement that it did not have enough of its own work to do.  \r\n\r\nThe DOJ OIP refuses to govern the DEA about this which generally is a corruption indicator. Something in the expenses to be inspected. \r\n\r\nI also requested the OIP Background report, which the agency DEA obstructed and only, sent back a portion which was the appeal submitted.\r\n\r\nI think this agency should be defunded and its duties passed to DHS, CBO, FBI, HHS. \r\n\r\nRecords are available publicly here:\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/expenses-127054/\r\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMacKenzie Orcutt",

While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v.

The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Files, memos, emails and other records mentioning or describing John \"Sonny\"\r\n    Franzese Sr. (February 6, 1917 \u2013 February 24, 2020), who was an\r\n    Italian-American mobster who was a longtime member of the Colombo crime\r\n    family.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

According to the authors of \"Superheroes, Movies, and the State\" (published in 2021 by the University Press of Kansas), Bert Ulrich, head of said office, released such \"annual reports\" to them for some recent years. I am requesting the same reports released to these authors along with any other annual reports still retained by the Multimedia Liaison Office.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publish a\r\n    number of . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdocument sets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Documents ordering, mentioning, authorizing, or otherwise relating to the\r\n    destruction and/or transfer of documents potentially responsive to Frank\r\n    Sturgis. See the attached FOIA response letter for additional information.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) regulations at 32 CFR Part 2002 apply to all executive branch agencies that designate or handle information that meets the standards for CUI.\r\n\r\nFollowing-up on your fax regarding the status of FOIA Request 2024-NLFO-02390, the request was completed on September 13, 2024.  I attached email that was sent to you with the instructions on how to retrieve the records.  I've also published the records in the SecureRelease reading room: https://www.securerelease.us/public-reading-room\r\n\r\nFYI - Your original July 27, 2024 request submitted through the Muckrock website wasn't actually received in our system until September 11 (I was expecting it in July and wondered what happened to you.)  When you questioned it in late August, we couldn't find any record of the request so we manually entered it into SecureRelease, and then in September numerous requests - including yours - were discovered in an unmonitored email box (we're still working with SecureRelease to figure out why they were in an email box instead of automatically populating in SecureRelease.)  The best way to ensure your requests are received immediately is to create a SecureRelease account and submit your requests directly through there.  Otherwise every time you submit a request with a new email address, SecureRelease forces you to create a brand new account tied directly to that email or your records can't be retrieved (unless they happen to be published in the Reading Room.)\r\n\r\n\r\nJodilyn M.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJames Earl Ray (March 10, 1928 \u2013 April 23, 1998) was an American convicted of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Ray was convicted on his 41st birthday after entering a guilty plea to forgo a jury trial.

        "communication": "The normalization of surveillance and the erosion of data privacy is on the rise in communities across Illinois. This surveillance capitalism is the commodification of personal data by the hands of elected officials and city governments. Often, these technologies are implemented without the fully informed consent of the public, who are being subject to 24/7 warrantless surveillance. Given this concerning trend, we are requesting documents that shed light on the City of Evanston\u2019s involvement with Placer.ai.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, we hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tContracts and Agreements: Copies of any contracts, agreements, order forms, or memoranda of understanding (MOUs) between the City of Evanston and Placer.ai, including any associated service-level agreements, terms of use, or scopes of work.\r\n\t2.\tData Usage Reports: Any reports, summaries, presentations, or internal documentation that detail how the City of Evanston is utilizing data or analytics from Placer.ai, including any findings or conclusions drawn from the data.\r\n\t3.\tPrivacy Policies and Guidelines: Any policies, guidelines, or internal communications concerning data privacy and protection related to the City of Evanston\u2019s use of Placer.ai. This should include how data from Placer.ai is collected, stored, used, or shared, as well as any privacy impact assessments conducted.\r\n\t4.\tFunding Information: Records detailing the funding sources for the City of Evanston\u2019s engagement with Placer.ai, including any external funding such as grants or private partnerships that contributed to the adoption of this service.\r\n\t5.\tPublic Notices and Engagement: Copies of any public notices, press releases, or communications that informed business owners and/or community members about the use of Placer.ai, as well as any documents outlining efforts to engage the public or seek community input on this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, we would be grateful if you would inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling our request.

As part of the transition, new tracking numbers were generated for many open FOIA requests. As you have five or more open FOIA requests, please find attached a chart with your requests pending in the Office of the Secretary\u2019s FOIA Unit, including each request\u2019s original and corresponding FOIAonline request numbers. We hope you find this helpful in any future correspondence with the Office of the Secretary\u2019s FOIA Unit.\r\n\r\nIf, upon review, you are no longer interested in any of these requests, we would be happy to assist you in closing them in FOIAonline or you can withdraw them directly in FOIAonline. Please note that unless and until you contact the Office of the Secretary\u2019s FOIA Unit and ask for a particular request or requests to be withdrawn, we will continue processing all of these requests.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out with any questions.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nLeah Fairman\n--\r\nDepartment of the Interior\r\nOffice of the Secretary, FOIA Office\r\n1849 C Street, NW, MS-7328\r\nWashington, D.C. 20240\r\nos_foia@ios.doi.gov\r\n(202) 513-0765 - phone\r\n(202) 219-2374 - fax",

Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month whereas complex requests necessarily take longer. At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track.  Please note that as a general matter, records in the Department are decentralized and our response will only cover information originating with or relating to JMD. If you are seeking information originating with or relating to other components of the Department of Justice, please make a FOIA request directly to those components.  If you have a question about the status of your FOIA request, you may contact this office by sending an email to JMDfoia@usdoj.gov or by calling 202-616-0253 during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 9AM to 5PM EST, excluding federal holidays.)  Please refer to JMD FOIA TRACKING NUMBER 131630 whenever you contact the Department regarding this request.  Sincerely,  Daniel Wagner FOIA Contact Justice Management Division\n",

For your information, the OIG is\r\nan independent unit of the National Archives and Records Administration\r\n(NARA) tasked by Congress to combat fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement\r\nwithin NARA.  As such, we have no control or authority over records kept\r\nand maintained by any other government agency, or even any office at NARA.\r\nWe only control those records generated within the OIG alone.  Accordingly,\r\nno other office at NARA controls OIG records.\r\n\r\nIn my initial response to you on June 20, 2019, I stated I found three\r\ntypes of records potentially related to your request.  First were things\r\nsuch as newsletters and emails sent to groups, which had various public\r\nnews stories summarized or listed which were publically available and not\r\nrelated to any agency actions.  These were considered unresponsive.\r\nSecond, several records belonging to NARA as an agency that were\r\npotentially responsive were referred over to the NGC FOIA office to review\r\nand potentially include in their response.  Finally, the OIG Office of\r\nInvestigations had some potentially responsive records, which were sent to\r\nthe FOIA office of another agency which had equities in them for a\r\nconsult.  This response covers these last records, and completes our\r\nresponse on this FOIA request.\r\n\r\nYour request and the potentially responsive records were sent to the\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and were assigned FBI FOI/PA Request\r\n# 1438678-000.  The redactions made by the FBI show on the attached\r\ndocument as white blocks with a black outline and the reasons for the FBI\u2019s\r\nredactions are labeled by each block.  In addition to these redactions, the\r\nNARA OIG also made additional redactions, which show as solid black boxes.\r\nThese are labeled with the reason as well.  These additional redactions\r\nwere made under FOIA Exemptions b(6) and b(7)(C) due to the privacy\r\ninterests of the other parties involved.  Redactions pursuant to Exemptions\r\nb(6) and b(7)(C) included information that constituted a clearly\r\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or records compiled for law\r\nenforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an\r\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  Information compiled for law\r\nenforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to interfere with\r\nenforcement proceedings is redacted pursuant to Exemption b(7)(A).   Law\r\nenforcement information which could reasonably be expected to disclose the\r\nidentity of a confidential source is redacted under Exemption b(7)(D).\r\nInformation that would disclose techniques and procedures for law\r\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions which could reasonably be\r\nexpected to risk circumvention of the law is redacted under Exemption\r\nb(7)(E).\r\n\r\nYou have the right to administratively appeal those determinations by\r\nwriting to the Archivist of the United States, National Archives and\r\nRecords Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD, 20740, within\r\nninety (90) calendar days of the date of this letter.  If you choose to\r\nappeal, your appeal letter and its envelope should be clearly marked\r\n\u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal,\u201d and you should explain why you believe\r\nNARA should release the withheld information.  Any appeal will be\r\ncoordinated with the Department of Justice Office of Information Policy\r\nregarding the FBI redactions.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss the NARA OIG redactions before filing an\r\nappeal to attempt to resolve your dispute without going through the appeals\r\nprocess, you may contact the OIG\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, James Springs, for\r\nassistance at:\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\nOffice of Inspector General\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 1300\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n (301) 837-3018\r\njames.springs@nara.gov\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may seek dispute resolution services on the FBI\r\nredactions by contacting the FBI\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison by emailing\r\nfoipaquestions@fbi.gov.  If you submit your dispute resolution\r\ncorrespondence with the FBI by email, the subject heading should clearly\r\nstate \u201cDispute Resolution Services.\u201d  Please also cite the FBI FOIPA\r\nRequest Number assigned to your request (#1438678-000) so it may be easily\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to resolve your FOIA dispute through the FOIA Public\r\nLiaisons, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), the Federal\r\nFOIA Ombudsman\u2019s office, offers mediation services to help resolve disputes\r\nbetween FOIA requesters and Federal agencies. The contact information for\r\nOGIS is:\r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road\u2013OGIS\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\nogis@nara.gov\r\nogis.archives.gov\r\n202-741-5770 or 1-877-684-6448\r\n\r\nFinally, in accordance with Department of Justice guidance, I would also\r\nlike to notify you that Congress excluded three discrete categories of law\r\nenforcement and national security records from the requirements of the\r\nFOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c) (2006 & Supp. IV 2010).  This response is limited\r\nto those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is\r\na standard notification given to all our requesters and should not be taken\r\nas an indication excluded records do, or do not, exist.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact me directly at\r\n301-837-1966 or john.simms@nara.gov.  Thank you for contacting the NARA\r\nOIG.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nJohn Simms\r\nCounsel to the Inspector General\r\nOffice of Inspector General\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n301-837-1966\r\n\r\nTHE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS TRANSMITTAL MAY BE CONFIDENTIAL AND MAY\r\nBE PROTECTED FROM DISCLOSURE UNDER ATTORNEY-CLIENT AND/OR ATTORNEY\r\nWORK-PRODUCT PRIVILEGES.

I respectfully request a review of this determination, as under the New York State Archives' ED-1 schedule, expense records such as those requested are required to be retained for at least six years following the end of the fiscal year in which they were created. Therefore, records from the 2017-2018 period should be available until at least end of 2024.\r\n\r\nGiven that these records fall within the retention period mandated by New York State guidelines, and considering the significance of transparency and accountability within public offices, I believe that these records should exist unless there is documented evidence of their lawful disposal according to the stated retention schedule.\r\n\r\nI request that the district review its records once more to ensure that no relevant documents have been overlooked and to provide a detailed explanation or documentation if it is concluded that the records have indeed been destroyed or are otherwise unavailable. Such transparency is crucial for public trust and the proper oversight of public resources.\r\n\r\nPlease advise me in writing of your decision regarding this appeal within ten business days as stipulated by Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(4)(a). Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMary Lee",

With reference to your public records request, Ref. # P761237-051024 , your substantially sought the following records: I am requesting records pertaining to the law enforcement activities by the Florida Highway Patrol during the public protest on May 1, 2024, part of the Free Palestine and Resistance Movement against Israeli aggression. \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\nDigital Documents: \r\n1. Body Camera Footage: Complete recordings from body-worn cameras of all officers involved from the start to the end of their deployment at the protest. \r\nLegal support: ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012) affirms the public\u2019s right to record public officials in public settings, which supports the disclosure of body camera footage. \r\n2. Radio Transmissions: All audio recordings and transcripts of radio communications involving law enforcement personnel during the protest. \r\nLegal support: Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978) indicates the public interest in accessing law enforcement communications for transparency. \r\n3. Text Communications: All SMS and instant messages sent to and from officers concerning the enforcement activities at the protest. \r\nLegal support: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998) supports the release of communications to ensure transparency in governmental operations. \r\n4. Aerial Footage: All video recordings from helicopters, drones, or any other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used during the protest. \r\nLegal support: Electronic Frontier Foundation v. Department of Transportation, 2015 (finding that aerial surveillance footage is subject to disclosure under FOIA to allow public analysis of governmental surveillance practices). \r\nPhysical Documents: \r\n5. Incident Reports and Briefings: All written reports, memos, and briefing documents pertaining to the law enforcement activities during the protest. \r\nLegal support: Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989) supports the disclosure of law enforcement records for public scrutiny. \r\n6. Operational Plans: Documents detailing the strategies and guidelines used for managing the protest. \r\nLegal support: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978) demonstrates the public's right to understand the strategic operations of public authorities. \r\nLegal Precedents and Public Interest Justification:. It has been determined that the estimated charges for production of the records will be as follows: \r\n\r\nFees Description: Staff Labor - 119.07(4)(d) - Extensive clerical, supervisory, or information technology labor (beyond 30 minutes): $250.00 \r\n\r\nEstimated Total: $250.00 \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you accept these estimated charges. If you do not respond within 10 business days after the date this statement is sent, your request will be deemed withdrawn, unless you have advised the Department that you will accept and will agree to pay the estimated cost or modify your request in response to the cost estimate. You may choose to respond to this letter by email, fax, regular mail, or by personally delivering your written response in person at this office. Please note that no work will be undertaken until we receive your response. \r\n\r\nOur contact information follows: \r\nvalerielockhart@flhsmv.gov \r\n\r\nPlease contact me and let me know how you would like to proceed. \r\nRespectfully yours, Valerie Lockhart FHP Regional Communications Centers FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL",

\n\n--- Please respond above this line --- \nDear , Thank you again for contacting the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. With regard to your public records request Ref. #P761237-051024, you substantially sought the following records: \"I am requesting records pertaining to the law enforcement activities by the Florida Highway Patrol during the public protest on May 1, 2024, part of the Free Palestine and Resistance Movement against Israeli aggression. \n\nRequested Records: \nDigital Documents: \n1. Body Camera Footage: Complete recordings from body-worn cameras of all officers involved from the start to the end of their deployment at the protest. \nLegal support: ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012) affirms the public\u2019s right to record public officials in public settings, which supports the disclosure of body camera footage. \n2. Radio Transmissions: All audio recordings and transcripts of radio communications involving law enforcement personnel during the protest. \nLegal support: Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978) indicates the public interest in accessing law enforcement communications for transparency. \n3. Text Communications: All SMS and instant messages sent to and from officers concerning the enforcement activities at the protest. \nLegal support: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998) supports the release of communications to ensure transparency in governmental operations. \n4. Aerial Footage: All video recordings from helicopters, drones, or any other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used during the protest. \nLegal support: Electronic Frontier Foundation v. Department of Transportation, 2015 (finding that aerial surveillance footage is subject to disclosure under FOIA to allow public analysis of governmental surveillance practices). \nPhysical Documents: \n5. Incident Reports and Briefings: All written reports, memos, and briefing documents pertaining to the law enforcement activities during the protest. \nLegal support: Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989) supports the disclosure of law enforcement records for public scrutiny. \n6. Operational Plans: Documents detailing the strategies and guidelines used for managing the protest. \nLegal support: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978) demonstrates the public's right to understand the strategic operations of public authorities. \nLegal Precedents and Public Interest Justification:.\" Payment received, flash drive was mailed out on September 20, 2024. Copy of receipt attached. \nIncluded with this message are download link(s) to the records you requested; those links remain active for 30 days. Accordingly, public records request Ref. #\u00a0P761237-051024 is CLOSED. \nRespectfully yours, \nLorigay Laskin \nFHP Troop C (Tampa Station) \nDEPARTMENT OF HIGHWAY SAFETY AND MOTOR VEHICLES\n",

As you say, \"Allegheny County Sheriff\u2019s Office utilizes a large array of policies that guide its operations...\" These are the policies which are being sought\u2014those which guide police operations. For example, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police publishes a \"manual of procedural orders\", which presumably does not contain information that would be excepted from disclosure under right-to-know law. https://pittsburghpa.gov/police/manual-procedural-orders\r\n\r\n2. The intention of requesting records from the Allegheny County Sheriff's Office was to obtain records in custody the Allegheny County Sheriff's Office, and not from other agencies. I will be sure to adjust the language of future requests.\r\n\r\n3. Certainly, I do not wish to endanger the Office's computer security or ongoing investigations. I believe the Office is well within its rights to redact or omit records which are excepted from disclosure. Please proceed with the request by supplying those policies which are not excepted.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJosh Chamberlain",
