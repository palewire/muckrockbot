Taylorsville Police Chief Gabe Horn told a local newspaper in December that Rasheem Carter filed a police report when he visited the station but declined to press any charges against whomever was threatening him. Police found Rasheem's body on November 2, 2022. https://www.natchezdemocrat.com/2022/12/07/family-seeking-answers-in-fayette-mans-death/\r\n\r\nI'm a senior reporter for the Guardian, and the family has been outspoken about this case. The case is a matter of public interest given that the case has been unresolved at the moment, and the case is under investigation.
