I request that these documents be made available to me in their entirety.\r\n\r\nAs you are aware, the AES is a widely used encryption algorithm that has been adopted as a standard by the United States government and is used extensively in the private sector. Given the importance of encryption in today's society, it is imperative that the public has a better understanding of the origins and design of the AES.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to cite case law that has upheld the public's right to access government records under FOIA. Specifically, in United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), the Supreme Court held that FOIA should be interpreted liberally to promote transparency and accountability in government. Additionally, in ACLU v. U.S. Department of Defense, 628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011), the D.C. Circuit held that the public has a right to access information about the government's use of encryption technologies.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that all relevant documents are provided, I request access to any records that mention or relate to Joan Daemen, Vincent Rijmen, or the AES. This would include, but is not limited to, any communications, memoranda, reports, or other documents related to the design or development of the AES. I also request access to any metadata or other information related to the NSA's XKEYSCORE program or any other program that may be relevant to this request.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to draw your attention to the attached article entitled \"The extended Rijndael-like block ciphers\". This article provides important context and background information on the AES and its designers. I request that this article be considered as a part of my FOIA request, and that any relevant documents referenced in the article be included in my request.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I request that a keystring search be conducted for any records related to Joan Daemen, Vincent Rijmen, or the AES. Furthermore, I would like to request any records related to the NSA's Enterprise Secure Logon User Repository (ESLUR) that may pertain to the AES or its designers.\r\n\r\nFinally, I request that the NSA not withhold or redact any responsive documents, even if they have been deleted. Any redactions or withholdings must be justified under FOIA's exemptions, and I reserve the right to challenge such redactions or withholdings in court.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",

It is important to understand how the NSA may be monitoring or analyzing these memes in order to protect privacy and civil liberties.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the NSA's monitoring or analysis of internet memes, including any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to this monitoring or analysis. Additionally, I am interested in any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the NSA's use of internet memes for any purpose, including propaganda or disinformation campaigns.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting any records related to the ELSUR program, XKeyscore program, metadata collection, or any other related programs that may be used for monitoring internet traffic and communications.\r\n\r\nI want to emphasize that I do not consent to the withholding, deletion, or redaction of any responsive records or documents, except in cases where the NSA can provide a specific justification for why the records are exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Please provide me with any non-exempt records or documents in their entirety, including any segregable portions that may be released.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I hereby provide notice that any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records or documents without providing a specific justification for why they are exempt from disclosure will be met with a complaint and legal action to compel the NSA to provide access to the requested records in accordance with the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to reference case law that affirms the public's right to access government records related to surveillance and monitoring. One key case is United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), which held that the FOIA reflects a \"general philosophy of full agency disclosure\" and that any exemptions to the FOIA must be narrowly construed. Another important case is Electronic Privacy Information Center v. National Security Agency, 678 F.3d 926 (D.C. Cir. 2012), which held that the NSA must release information related to the agency's monitoring of internet traffic and communications.\r\n\r\nIf any responsive records or documents are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide me with a justification for each exemption relied upon.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

In order to ensure a comprehensive search for responsive records, I am also requesting an interagency search for any records that may be held by other law enforcement agencies or government entities.\r\n\r\nI want to emphasize that I do not consent to the withholding, deletion, or redaction of any responsive records or documents, except in cases where the Texas Department of Public Safety can provide a specific justification for why the records are exempt from disclosure under the Texas Public Information Act.

Specifically, local case law includes the Dallas Morning News v. City of Dallas, 281 S.W.3d 708 (Tex. App. \u2013 Dallas 2009, no pet.), which held that a government entity cannot withhold requested information unless it can demonstrate that the information falls within a specific exception under the Texas Public Information Act.

App. \u2013 Austin 2009, pet. denied), which affirmed the public's right to access government records and held that the Texas Department of Public Safety must release requested information unless it falls within a specific exception under the Texas Public Information Act.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the Texas Department of Public Safety's surveillance or investigation of Black Lives Matter, including any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to this surveillance or investigation. I am also requesting any communications between the Texas Department of Public Safety and other law enforcement agencies or government entities related to the surveillance or investigation of Black Lives Matter.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am interested in any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the Texas Department of Public Safety's surveillance or investigation of any groups or individuals associated with Black Lives Matter or involved in activism related to racial justice, police reform, or other related issues. This may include but is not limited to groups such as the Movement for Black Lives, Campaign Zero, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to request a key string search for any records or documents related to Black Lives Matter or any other related groups, as well as any communications or activities related to these groups. Additionally, please provide any records or documents related to any specialty units within the Texas Department of Public Safety that may be involved in surveillance or investigation activities related to Black Lives Matter or other related groups.\r\n\r\nIf any responsive records or documents are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide me with a justification for each exemption relied upon.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am writing to request access to any records or files held by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) related to Jason William Mizell, who is also known as Jam Master Jay. Mizell was a founding member of the hip-hop group Run-DMC and a pioneer in the music industry. He was tragically killed on October 30, 2002, at his recording studio in Queens, New York. I am referencing an article from Rolling Stone magazine, published on March 4, 2021, titled \"Jam Master Jay Alleged Killer Goes to Trial,\" which provides some background on the investigation into his death and the subsequent trial of his alleged killer.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), I request that all records be released to me, including any documents, memos, emails, or other materials that reference or relate to Jason William Mizell or his death. Additionally, I request that a key string search be conducted to ensure that all relevant records are provided to me. Specifically, I would like to request that the following key strings be used in the search:\r\n\r\nJam Master Jay\r\nJason Mizell\r\nRun-DMC\r\nMurder\r\nHomicide\r\nInvestigation\r\nSuspect\r\nArrest\r\nTrial\r\nEvidence\r\nWitness\r\nStatement\r\nInterview\r\nAutopsy\r\nForensic\r\nBallistics\r\nGang\r\nDrug\r\nCriminal\r\nViolence\r\nNew York City\r\nI also request any records that may be responsive to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) program.\r\n\r\nI would like to remind you that the FOIA reflects a strong presumption in favor of disclosure, and that any exemptions to the Act must be narrowly construed. The Supreme Court has held that the FOIA promotes transparency and accountability in government, and that any exemptions to the Act must be based on specific and narrowly defined grounds. See United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989); John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146 (1989); and Nat'l Archives & Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), among other cases.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would like to give notice that I do not consent to any withholding, redaction, or deletion of records that may be responsive to my request, except in cases where the documents are clearly exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Please provide me with any non-exempt records or documents in their entirety, including any segregable portions that may be released.\r\n\r\nI hereby provide notice that any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records or documents without providing a specific justification for why they are exempt from disclosure will be met with a complaint and legal action to compel the FBI or any other agency to provide access to the requested records in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",

This may include complaints related to securities fraud, insider trading, or any other area over which the SEC has jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nI would like to request information on any companies owned or controlled by Donald J Trump, including but not limited to the Trump Organization, Trump Foundation, and Trump International Hotels. Please include any and all relevant communications, documents, or other materials related to complaints filed against these entities or their representatives.\r\n\r\nTo support my request, I would like to cite several relevant court cases, including SEC v. Trump, 279 F. Supp. 2d 340 (S.D.N.Y. 2003), SEC v. Trump, 2020 WL 4044162 (S.D.N.Y. July 17, 2020), and SEC v. Trump, 2021 WL 1520177 (S.D.N.Y. April 19, 2021). These cases demonstrate the importance of transparency and accountability in the securities industry, and underscore the need for disclosure of relevant complaints and information.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to provide notice that any withholding or deletion of responsive records without a lawful basis will result in my pursuit of legal action and complaint to the appropriate authorities. As you are aware, FOIA requires agencies to disclose all non-exempt records in response to a request within a reasonable time frame, and any failure to do so would constitute a violation of the law.\r\n\r\nPlease provide any responsive records to this request on a rolling basis, as they become available.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Additionally, I would like to request any emails sent to or from the domain polksheriff.org, including any recipients in the \"To,\" \"From,\" \"CC,\" or \"BCC\" fields.\r\n\r\nPlease provide any responsive records for the last 5 years, dating from April 5, 2018 to April 5, 2023.\r\n\r\nAs per Florida Public Records Law, agencies are required to provide access to public records unless the records are exempted by law. If any responsive documents contain exempt information, please provide me with the remaining non-exempt portions of the records, and redact or withhold the exempt information.\r\n\r\nI would like to remind you that under Florida law, agencies have an obligation to disclose records and not to withhold or redact information that can be reasonably segregated and not subject to exemption. If you withhold or redact any information that should have been released or provide an inadequate response, I will be forced to take legal action and file a complaint in court.\r\n\r\nI would like to point out some relevant local court cases to support my request. The Florida Supreme Court in Times Publishing Co. v. City of St. Petersburg, 558 So. 2d 487, 493 (Fla. 1990) held that the Public Records Law must be construed liberally in favor of open access to public records, and that exemptions must be strictly construed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal in State v. City of Deerfield Beach, 426 So. 2d 1332, 1336 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983) emphasized that agencies have a duty to search all of their files for responsive records, and cannot limit their search to only certain files or categories.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
