My paralegal has estimated that it will take 3 hours to fulfill your request.\r\nFor purposes of the cost incurred, the first hour is free, so in actuality it will only be the charge for two hours of the paralegal's time at $34.74 per hour for a total cost of $69.48.\r\n\r\nWhile that figure is just an estimate (it may be slightly higher or lower than the estimated figure), the estimation is usually fairly accurate.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to proceed with your public records request given the amount of the estimation, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DA2901.D4840960]\r\nTroy Bryant | Associate General Counsel, Regulatory Boards Division\r\nOffice of Legal Counsel\r\nDavy Crockett Tower, 12th Floor\r\n500 James Robertson Pkwy, Nashville, TN 37243\r\n615-770-0447\r\nTroy.Bryant@tn.gov<mailto:Troy.Bryant@tn.gov>\r\ntn.gov/commerce<http://www.tn.gov/commerce>\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MISSION: To provide exceptional legal service and valuable counsel to achieve the mission of our clients and serve the people of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n_____________NOTICE______________\r\nThis e-mail message and any attachment is for use by the recipient only, and contain information that may be legally privileged and confidential from the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, Legal Division.
