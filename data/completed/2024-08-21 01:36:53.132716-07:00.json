Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Please search all CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal email addresses, personal cell phone numbers, employee identification numbers, and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Further, portions of records are exempt from release pursuant to Section 7.5(h) of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure \u201cinformation the disclosure of which is exempted under the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act, and records of any lawfully created State or local inspector general\u2019s office that would be exempt if created or obtained by an Executive Inspector General\u2019s office.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7.5(h). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Further, redactions have been applied in accordance with section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.

I understand there is an ordinance to follow and the need to cover administrative costs, but I believe a waiver is appropriate in this case.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, contributing to transparency and understanding of law enforcement operations. This aligns with the public's right to know and fosters a more informed citizenry. This request is not being made for any commercial purpose or profit. \r\n\r\nWe have obtained the requested information from nearly 1,000 other agencies at no cost. This demonstrates that such requests are routinely fulfilled without imposing financial burdens on requesters. \r\n\r\nIn consideration of these factors, I'd like to request that the Wichita Police Department waive the fees associated with this request.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if I am able to access an existing agency roster containing some part of the requested information, it could potentially save time and resources for both parties.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration of this appeal.",

Your response is required by June 12, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records. Exact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color images. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\n1. All text, email, or chat messages (including group messages, in any form or application including but not limited to SMS, MMS, WhatsApp, WeChat, Signal, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Hangouts, Skype, Teams) sent or received to/cc/bcc/from between Harlan Kelly Jr. and London Breed, on government or personal accounts from Jan 1, 2015 and present (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017))\r\n\r\n2. All text, email, or chat messages (including group messages, in any form or application including but not limited to SMS, MMS, WhatsApp, WeChat, Signal, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Hangouts, Skype, Teams) sent or received to/cc/bcc/from between Harlan Kelly Jr. and Walter Wong/Jaidin Consulting Group/Jaidin Associates (including but not limited to jaidin@pacbell.net, jdngrp@pacbell.net, or any email address ending with jaidin.net ), on government or personal accounts from Jan 1, 2015 and present (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017))\r\n\r\n3. All text, email, or chat messages (including group messages, in any form or application including but not limited to SMS, MMS, WhatsApp, WeChat, Signal, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Hangouts, Skype, Teams) sent or received to/cc/bcc/from between Harlan Kelly Jr. and Mohammed Nuru, on government or personal accounts from Jan 1, 2015 and present (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017))\r\n\r\n4. All text, email, or chat messages (including group messages, in any form or application including but not limited to SMS, MMS, WhatsApp, WeChat, Signal, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Hangouts, Skype, Teams) sent or received to/cc/bcc/from between Harlan Kelly Jr. and Naomi Kelly, on government or personal accounts from Jan 1, 2020 and present (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017))\r\n\r\nFor text messages: While the phone numbers are not needed, the following must be preserved: the timestamps, the textual content, attachments, and images, and also ALL sender and recipient names (including groups). Pursuant to SF Admin Code 67.21(l), which requires you to use any electronic format that we request, please provide the records in spreadsheet format.   For an example of the format of the response, see SFPD Chief Scott's prior response here: https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2020/04/14/Text_Messages_Breed_Scott_Redacted.pdf and clearly referenced redaction justifications here: https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2020/04/14/ChiefOfficeResponse201.pdf (though I do not concede all of them are appropriate redactions) .  Please provide rolling responses, starting with the most recent records going backwards.  Messages to/from before your current department head became the department head must still be provided.\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.

(See also San Francisco Administrative Code \u00a7 67.1(g)).\r\n\r\nFinally, we have redacted from the email titled, \"Night Noise permit requirements\" (Bates Stamp #234-235) content constituting privileged and confidential attorney-client communications.

Each City department receives, searches, and responds to public records requests on behalf of its own department, not Citywide. Accordingly you may wish to also contact the Department of Public Works, the City Administrator's Office, and/or the Mayor's Office, as those departments and offices may also have records responsive to your request.\r\nBest regards,\r\nSFPUC Public Records",

In no event shall the author be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or any other damages whatsoever. The digital signature, if any, in this email is not an indication of a binding agreement or offer; it merely authenticates the sender. Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\nYou appear to have partially obscured some of the text messages between Harlan Kelly Jr. and Walter Wong, but the text of some of those records is still visible in \"Walter redacted final.pdf\". It's unclear why these communications - regarding meetings, contracting, and travel between the two persons, have been partially obscured - they are neither completely redacted nor plainly visible as they have black rectangles on top of them, but they remain part of the record.\r\n\r\nTherefore, below are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to SFPUC and Harlan Kelly Jr. Your response is required by July 8, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records. Exact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color images. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\n1. All calendar entries of any kind, with all details, invitee lists, attachments, and metadata, for Harlan Kelly Jr. for any meetings or travel with Walter Wong (including but not limited to jaidin@pacbell.net, jdngrp@pacbell.net, or any email address ending with jaidin.net ) (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017)); see also SOTF 19047 Anonymous v. Breed\r\n\r\n2. All payments made by Harlan Kelly Jr. to Walter Wong/Jaidin Consulting Group/Jaidin Associates/affiliated companies (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017))\r\n\r\n3. All payments made by Walter Wong/Jaidin Consulting Group/Jaidin Associates/affiliated companies to Harlan Kelly Jr. (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017))\r\n\r\n4. All contracts between Walter Wong/Jaidin Consulting Group/Jaidin Associates/affiliated companies and Harlan Kelly Jr. (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017))\r\n\r\nPlease provide rolling responses, starting with the most recent records going backwards. \r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations. Remember Mr. Kelly has an obligation to maintain in a professional and businesslike manner their correspondence and release them as public records (SF Admin Code 67.27-9(a)); and we will cross-check your responses with all other parties to ensure you have not destroyed or withheld records improperly.\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website like NextRequest to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations.

As explained in our July 3rd email to you, we redacted from these records messages containing personal and private information that did not constitute a \"public record.\"  Although the legal basis for these redactions was proper, we now realize that the technical method we used to black out the private material did not in fact protect the private information from disclosure.  That was not our intent and was an inadvertent error.  The material we intended to redact contains sensitive personal information that is protected from disclosure by Cal. Constitution Art. I, Sec. I and Section 6254(c) of the Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nIn such cases of accidental, inadvertent disclosure of private or confidential information in response to a Public Records Act request, the documents must be returned and copies destroyed if the City notifies those who have received an inadvertently disclosed record.  (See Ardon v. City of Los Angeles (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1176). The SFPUC hereby requests that MuckRock immediately destroy all copies of Bates numbers PUC 000175 through PUC 000219 in its possession and remove them from all publicly accessible locations, including the MuckRock.com website.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the version of this text exchange that we shared with you on July 6, 2020 has been removed from the Sharefile weblink. You can access a new redacted version of this text exchange at the following link: https://sfpuc.sharefile.com/d-sabd81b687ef4187b.\r\n\r\nPlease respond on or before Thursday July 9 at 5 pm confirming that you have destroyed and/or removed these records.

        "communication": "Thank you for those records.  This is a reminder that the following requests sent July 7 have had no response whatsoever, including a lack of extension , in violation of the CPRA. You need to inform me which requests have records, which are being denied with justification, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore, below are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to SFPUC and Harlan Kelly Jr. Your response is required by July 8, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records. Exact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color images. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\n1. All calendar entries of any kind, with all details, invitee lists, attachments, and metadata, for Harlan Kelly Jr. for any meetings or travel with Walter Wong (including but not limited to jaidin@pacbell.net, jdngrp@pacbell.net, or any email address ending with jaidin.net ) (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017)); see also SOTF 19047 Anonymous v. Breed\r\n\r\n2. All payments made by Harlan Kelly Jr. to Walter Wong/Jaidin Consulting Group/Jaidin Associates/affiliated companies (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017))\r\n\r\n3. All payments made by Walter Wong/Jaidin Consulting Group/Jaidin Associates/affiliated companies to Harlan Kelly Jr. (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017))\r\n\r\n4. All contracts between Walter Wong/Jaidin Consulting Group/Jaidin Associates/affiliated companies and Harlan Kelly Jr. (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017))\r\n\r\nPlease provide rolling responses, starting with the most recent records going backwards.\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations. Remember Mr. Kelly has an obligation to maintain in a professional and businesslike manner their correspondence and release them as public records (SF Admin Code 67.27-9(a)); and we will cross-check your responses with all other parties to ensure you have not destroyed or withheld records improperly.\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website like NextRequest to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. The email address sending this request is a PUBLICLY-VIEWABLE MAILBOX. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock).

The SOTF have started to conduct remote meetings via videoconference and are working to establish procedures to resume all operations including the processing of complaints.\r\nWhile the Sunshine Ordinance requires that certain actions be taken within 45 days, the Covid-19 emergency has forced delays and immense new backlogs for complaint hearings.  We write today to ask if you are willing to waive the 45 day rule for your complaint.\r\nThe SOTF intends to resume hearing complaints on a limited basis and complaints will be queued to be heard in the near future.  We continue to work to address technical issues posed by remote meetings.  We are aware of the time sensitivity of your records requests.  Please be assured that the SOTF appreciates the urgency of your matters and the importance of handling them in a timely manner.\r\nIf you have further questions about your files or have other issues, please feel free to email the SOTF Administrator at the email below.\r\nCheryl Leger\r\nAssistant Clerk, Board of Supervisors\r\nCheryl.Leger@sfgov.org<mailto:Cheryl.Leger@sfgov.org>\r\nTel: 415-554-7724\r\nFax: 415-554-5163\r\nwww.sfbos.org\r\n\r\n[CustomerSatisfactionIcon]<http://www.sfbos.org/index.aspx?page=104>  Click here<http://www.sfbos.org/index.aspx?page=104> to complete a Board of Supervisors Customer Service Satisfaction form.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Research Center<http://www.sfbos.org/index.aspx?page=9681> provides 24-hour access to Board of Supervisors legislation, and archived matters since August 1998.\r\n\r\nDisclosures: Personal information that is provided in communications to the Board of Supervisors is subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act and the San Francisco Sunshine Ordinance.

These were not responsive to my request on June 11.   I'm not arguing PUC has to go talk to Kelly now as a former employee (for this request) - but if you (i.e. PUC, or any of its current employees) have anywhere in your computer systems or in hardcopy any copies (including the black hiliter but unredacted file) of responsive records - you must provide them to me.   I know that your agency still possesses at least some of these records both based on the black hiliter file and also based on your admission in the recent letter to me ( https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2021/02/22/2-22-21_Letter_re_Harlan_Kelly_texts.pdf ).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnonymous",

        "communication": "Supervisor of Records Dennis Herrera:\r\n\r\nThis is a petition under SF Admin Code 67.21(d) to determine in writing that the redacted portions of the attached exhibits and of the attachment on page 7 of the Melanie records are public and order them disclosed.  It continues to challenge various previously-unappealed parts of the PUC's response to the June 11, 2020 request from this email address.  You may wish to consider it as part of the prior-filed March 2 and March 9 petitions re: overly-redacted Kelly-Breed messages, and March 9 petition re: overly-redacted Naomi Kelly-Harlan Kelly messages, as long as you make determinations on all challenged records.  The Melanie record has been redacted voluntarily by us to remove a phone number which was published by PUC itself.\r\n\r\nAs we have already proven via prior petitions, the PUC previously unlawfully redacted certain text messages between Harlan Kelly Jr. and Walter Wong.  Moreover, the PUC has admitted as such in its Feb 22, 2021 letter (in which it also re-released a new version of mostly-unredacted Kelly-Wong texts) and via DCA Jon Givner's letter of March 8, 2021.  The PUC apparently violated the law because it allowed Harlan Kelly Jr. to control the redaction of his own records without any oversight by the PUC itself -- which also was apparently then and remains now the policy and practice of the City, pursuant to your long-standing advice to the City re: your interpretation of City of San Jose v. Superior Court.  However, as you discuss in your memo interpreting, the City is always ultimately responsible for the actions and judgments of its employees in such matter.\r\n\r\nGiven Kelly's prior mis-redaction of the Walter Wong texts to protect  sensitive-but-disclosable communications, there is no reason to believe that the redactions made in the attached text messages were then or are currently lawful, and each must be justified under a specific provision of the law.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a copy of the attachment on page 7 of the Melanie records must be produced as required by Admin Code 67.21.  This tiny, compressed, printed and scanned version is unreadable and thus withholds its textual content, which is precisely why we have successfully previously argued that such production does not even constitute a \"copy\" of the underlying record (see SOTF decisions 19098 Anonymous v Police Department, 19131 Anonymous v Cisneros).\r\n\r\nOn March 10, 2021, you asserted a right to simply refuse to issue determinations to petitions filed pursuant to Admin Code 67.21(d).  It is telling that you have decided to do so as we have continued to successfully uncover violations of the law by City agencies and officials, including both by yourself personally and your office (see SOTF decisions 19108 Anonymous v Herrera, 19044 Anonymous v Office of the City Attorney, 19120 Anonymous v Office of the City Attorney).\r\n\r\nIf you refuse to review the records and issue a determination and order if needed, you will be violating Admin Code 67.21(d) yourself and potentially aiding your City clients in violating the law as a direct result of willfully refusing to perform your own legally-mandated duties.\r\n\r\nThe City has throughout its history, whether by declaring war on the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force or on successful transparency advocates themselves, attempted to neuter the Sunshine Ordinance to prevent disclosure of all lawfully-disclosable public information which may be unfriendly to senior officials' political prospects.  Yet the public has the right to know whether its representatives conduct the public business in the interest of the public or in their private interest.\r\n\r\nAs such advocates become more successful, your office appears to consider them a threat to your control over the City's public records regime, instead of treating us fairly as petitioners in a proceeding where you act in a quasi-judicial role.  There is no doubt I file numerous petitions -- and those petitions and complaints have forced the City to become significantly more compliant with the Sunshine Ordinance, which can be seen by the additional disclosures your office causes agencies to provide in response to my petitions and the nearly entirely successful series of complaints I have won at the SOTF.\r\n\r\nAs long as the City continues to violate the law -- apparently often due to your deputies' poor advice or training -- no ethical option exists other than to continue to petition and appeal for complete, timely, and lawful disclosure, without exception.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAn Anonymous Independent Journalist",

This is the page where the PUC in its Feb 2021 production removed the pre-2015 messages.  One page should not take this long and this constitutes an unreasonable delay.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder:\r\n- PUC published a PDF record in July 2020 at https://sfpuc.sharefile.com/d-sfaf513caac747dcb with nearly completely unredacted Kelly-Wong messages.  Its first page contained pre-2015 messages.\r\n- PUC in July 2020 requested a retraction and that I delete my copy of that PDF (which I voluntarily did, and without conceding any obligation to do so), and PUC published a replacement which redacted most of what Kelly and Wong said to each other, including redacting the pre-2015 messages.\r\n- PUC in Feb 2021 provided a third version of the file at https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2021/02/22/Harlan_Kelly_Text_Messages_-_Redacted_Jan_29_2021.pdf which unredacted most of the Kelly-Wong messages but completely removed the pre-2015 portion as non-responsive.\r\n\r\nI want that pre-2015 public record portion.\r\n\r\n2.

        "communication": "Dear Requester,\r\n\r\nThis is in response to your request for public records dated March 9, 2021, wherein you asked for \"the original unredacted PDF of texts between Kelly and Wong, in its original electronic format.\"\r\n\r\nAs you recall, on July 9, 2020, due to an \"inadvertent error in the redactions we performed for the text messages we provided you on July 6, 2020,\" we demanded that you destroy all copies of the record you have again requested and not forward copies to others, and we provided you a copy of the record in its place, available here<https://sfpuc.sharefile.com/d-s62b89803d7484d6e94cbc0ce1b8b3ad3>.\r\n\r\nDue to the extraordinary circumstances discussed in the February 22, 2021 letter sent to you (available here<https://sfpuc.sharefile.com/d-s62b89803d7484d6e94cbc0ce1b8b3ad3>), we released a new version of the text chain on February 22 with significantly fewer redactions. Therefore, with the exception of the text messages predating 2015 contained on the page Bates stamped PUC 000175, we have disclosed to you as of February 22 all non-exempt information that you now seek. You have separately requested text messages in this chain that predate 2015, and we are currently reviewing those messages with the City Attorney's Office. As mentioned in the email we sent to you on March 18, 2021, we anticipate we will provide you with a response to that request on or before next Friday, March 26.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we interpret your March 9, 2021 request to seek disclosure of the same information already provided to you on July 9, 2020 and February 22, 2021 and resent with this email. With regard to your remaining request for text messages pre-dating January 1, 2015, we estimate that we will fully respond to your request on or before Friday, March 26, 2021.\nBest Regards,\r\nMayara Ruski Augusto Sa\r\nSFPUC Public Records Senior Analyst",

These, I know you have retained somewhere.\r\n\r\n(2) Any text, chat, or instant messages between Harlan Kelly Jr. and any of David Gray, Julie Labonte, Henry Alvarez, (Rudolph) Dwayne Jones, Chris Gruwell, Tommy Moala, Paul Giusti, Juliet Ellis, Harlan Wong, Willie Brown, Chief William Scott, Tom Hui, or Nick Bovis.  These, maybe you have lying around on a computer.   Possibly an iMessage backup or similar.\r\n\r\nYou have provided some of these records in the past, but this is a NEW request, that you need to provide a new response to. Based on your Wong/Kelly response, somewhere on your PUC government systems (and not Kelly's PEDs) is likely a fully unredacted, no-time-limit record of these messages and PUC must now use its own judgment (not Kelly's) to decide what to redact here. \r\n\r\nYou may, at this moment, not have retained images, attachments, etc. but if you do retain them anywhere, you need to turn them over.   But they may very well be stored within the archive of the iMessages that are apparently on your computer systems.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like an exact copy of the native PDF files (after redactions) - not a print/scan copy.  Acrobat can correctly apply redactions where the black rectangle cannot be removed - but you just need to use the tool correctly.   I have won multiple SOTF rulings on this same matter and will file complaints if you do not comply.\r\n\r\n--Anonymous",

Once we receive a response from the SEC staff, our office will continue to process your request as expeditiously as possible.  Due to the unforeseen delays, the new estimated completion date (ECD) is December 31, 2023.  This new ECD is to ensure that the agency\u2019s search of records is accurate, and if records are located, sufficient time to review them for responsiveness.  We do sincerely apologize for the unusually long delays.  You may continue to contact me during the interim.\r\n\nKindest Regards,\r\n\r\n      Alysia Morrow\r\nFOIA Research Specialist\r\nOffice of FOIA Services\r\n\r\nOFFICE                 +1 202 551 8376\r\namorrowa@sec.gov<mailto:amorrowa@sec.gov>\r\n\r\n[Title: SEC logo]",

        "communication": "Kinda, yeah, but not exactly.\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting you run the search again but only with that parameter returning larger files, with the intent of seeing how many files are of the kind that might fit the \"1 GB of data can contain anywhere from 16,000 individual pages to over 60,000 pages\" estimate. Using size:1048568..1074000000 returns all the results that are between about a megabyte and a gigabyte. I'm making an educated guess that a very small number of files are responsible for the majority of the on disk space.\r\n\r\nI suspect that some files are very large on disk (like powerpoints with uncompressed images), but have very few pages that need to be reviewed. As an example, a scientist colleague of mine once had a powerpoint presentation that was more than a gigabyte in size, with something like only 50 slides. She'd included some videos that had never been compressed, which drastically inflated the file size.\r\n\r\nI do not know exactly what features the city pays for (the licensing agreement with Microsoft is the subject of another ongoing FOIL request of mine!), but one possible option is you may be able to export a report to see more information about the documents the search returns:\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ediscovery-export-a-content-search-report\r\n\r\nAn alternative that I provided was to simply download a copy of the larger search results and spot check them to see if there are just a few files that account for the majority of the on-disk space. That's very easy with some common free software, but if you wish to do it manually, increasing the parameter to something like size:52430000..1074000000 should reduce the volume of files even further.\r\n\r\nI'd expect that using size:1048568..1074000000 might return several hundred files, and size:52430000..1074000000 might return a few dozen. If you run the 50 MB-1GB search and the size of the responsive records are like 10GB, that means we've found the culprit! And I can ask you to either review the number of pages in that files when estimating the voluminousness of the request as a whole. If it's just a few powerpoints, neither of us have to worry about days  spent redacting 16,000 pages, it may only be a hundred.",

        "communication": "Hello there, we are approaching three missed agency-proposed records production dates. Will the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date/deadline most recently proposed by the agency be met?\r\n\r\nI would like to assume the agency is being forthright with me about meeting a date they propose, and have no knowledge of anything that they might be able to reasonably foresee preventing them from producing the requested and agreed upon records. I struggle to fathom how a pre-existing and ongoing backlog could surprise anybody by causing delays in records production - some agencies have abused this with me in a downright rude manner to delay requests more than a dozen times. \r\n\r\nI have no personal animus with any individual employed by the department - in a likely understaffed role - who is following routine agency procedures, and I presume they have no issue with me. We're all working with unfair systems run by people we have no contact with! Indeed, the records access officer I dealt with earlier was exceptionally helpful and more technically competent than the majority of records access officers that I've interacted with.\r\n\r\nOver the years I have learned that such agency-proposed records production dates are more often missed than met, and it's no more likely the agency will meet the next date they propose than the one they've missed. On muckrock, this agency is a bit better than the average NYC agency, and returns records with an average of 113 days, so we're just on the edge of meeting this date! That's good news - I just want to rely on something better than crossed fingers.\r\n\r\nI am pre-emptively appealing on grounds of constructive denial of records. I am asking the agency to provide guarantees that the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date/deadline most recently proposed by the agency will be met, and if it cannot be met under current circumstances, that the agency shall either provide a date for which they will provide such records absent circumstances a reasonable person cannot reasonably forsee delaying production of records, or assign sufficient staff to meet the agency proposed records production date. \r\n\r\nI look forward to this appeal being moot upon production of records by the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date.",

Inspector Tony Robles noted that on May 9, 2024, he went to the Baltimore and spoke with the complaining tenant, and took photos.  Please provide all of those notes, documents, photos or videos.\r\n3. All communications regarding the February 2022 inspection by Tony Robles of the Baltimore, during which he noted over 100 violations for lack of deadbolts, but James Heiberg said to delete those violations. \r\n4. All communications between anyone from Code Enforcement and anyone at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, regarding the deadbolts at the Baltimore.  This is including but not limited to the text messages and emails that Robert Gilardi kindly sends to Mark Dyer rather than issuing a Notice to Comply. This includes communications between Code Enforcement on the one hand, and on the other hand,  AHF's: Mark Dyer, Michael Weinstein, Jonathan Eisenberg, Tom Myers, Conrad Sison, Beatrice Di Marco, Dominique Eastman, Herbert Ellis,  Juan Larios.\r\n5. Any discussion (including emails, text messages, memos, notes) between any Code Enforcement employee, (including but not limited to James Heiberg, Robert Gilardi, Tony Robles, Ann Sewill, etc.), that includes any of the following terms: \"1941.3\" \"deadbolt\" \"dead bolt\" \"91.8607\" \"door lock\" \"91.8607\" and/or \"897099.\" \r\n6. Any discussion between any Code Enforcement employee, about why it decided to exclude the exact complaint language from the publicly accessible Property Activity Report on complaint #897099.\r\n7. Any emails with the subject line \"Complaint # 897099 / Baltimore Hotel / Carlos Brum/ Lack of Deadbolts\"\r\n\r\nThis public records act request is not limited to the custodian of records simply forwarding this request to the named individuals here. This request demands that the custodian of records actually contact its IT department and conduct a search with the specific parameters and search terms. This request demands electronic copies of these records in their native format, and not printed out and scanned.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnnette Morasch",

None of the emails which show they have attachments were produced with the attachments. \r\nThese records also do not include any of the following requested documents:\r\n\r\n2. Inspector Tony Robles noted that on May 9, 2024, he went to the Baltimore and spoke with the complaining tenant, and took photos. Please provide all of those notes, documents, photos or videos.\r\n3. All communications regarding the February 2022 inspection by Tony Robles of the Baltimore, during which he noted over 100 violations for lack of deadbolts, but James Heiberg said to delete those violations.\r\n4. All communications between anyone from Code Enforcement and anyone at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, regarding the deadbolts at the Baltimore. This is including but not limited to the text messages and emails that Robert Gilardi kindly sends to Mark Dyer rather than issuing a Notice to Comply. This includes communications between Code Enforcement on the one hand, and on the other hand, AHF's: Mark Dyer, Michael Weinstein, Jonathan Eisenberg, Tom Myers, Conrad Sison, Beatrice Di Marco, Dominique Eastman, Herbert Ellis, Juan Larios.\r\n5. Any discussion (including emails, text messages, memos, notes) between any Code Enforcement employee, (including but not limited to James Heiberg, Robert Gilardi, Tony Robles, Ann Sewill, etc.), that includes any of the following terms: \"1941.3\" \"deadbolt\" \"dead bolt\" \"91.8607\" \"door lock\" \"91.8607\" and/or \"897099.\"\r\n\r\nDocuments have been redacted without reason. I understand why you woudl redact tenant contact information (which you did for some, but not others). But there are whole chunks of communications redacted without saying who was involved in the redacted communication. Thus the majority of my requests were ignored by the  City. \r\n\r\nConclusion. If I do not receive a fully compliant response to my PRA, we will file a writ of mandate and seek attorneys' fees on August 19, 2024.",

Provide records sufficient to show copies of 10 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not seeking any personally identifiable information or otherwise exempt information. As required by the statute, please ensure that the requested documents are redacted rather than exempting the entirety of the document. Additionally, for any and all exemptions used to redact exempt information, please provide clear and convincing evidence for each exemption used by your agency.\r\n\r\nBecause this request is in the public interest for Illinois nonprofit The FOIA Bakery\u2019s work to advocate for public education, please waive any fees in accordance with 5 ILCS \u00a7 140/6(c).

Your FOIA Center reference number for tracking purposes is: N015952-080424 \r\nYou have requested the following records: To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPer the CPS Comprehensive Policy on Attendance (Section 703.1, Board Report 22-0622-PO1), Section II, paragraph B (a):\r\n\r\n\"Schools must send a letter notifying a student\u2019s family of 5 unexcused absences, and, subsequently, 10 unexcused absences. 10 day letters of unexcused absence notification are to be sent certified, return receipt requested.\"\r\n\r\nIn FOIA N014933-022924, the District indicates, \"Be advised that while there is a system in place that advises schools of students who have had 5-day and 10-day unexcused absences, the correspondence that is to be sent out to parents is the responsibility of individual schools.\"\r\n\r\n1. Provide a blank template letter for the 5 day unexcused absence letter;\r\n2. Provide a blank template letter for the 10 day unexcused absence letter;\r\n3. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 5 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024;\r\n4. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 10 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not seeking any personally identifiable information or otherwise exempt information. As required by the statute, please ensure that the requested documents are redacted rather than exempting the entirety of the document. Additionally, for any and all exemptions used to redact exempt information, please provide clear and convincing evidence for each exemption used by your agency.\r\n\r\nBecause this request is in the public interest for Illinois nonprofit The FOIA Bakery\u2019s work to advocate for public education, please waive any fees in accordance with 5 ILCS \u00a7 140/6(c). Feel free to contact me with any questions, or if clarification is needed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMiriam Bhimani\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fchicago-public-schools-3121%252Ftruancy-letter-notices-170888%252F%253F&url_auth_token=AAATZ6_n4zL9LUQrOAhSu0BQ7O8%3A1sanBo%3AYCro7lg516eF4JArdx_Ih5r8tVrhL5dMIg75F67Q86I \r\n \r\nChicago Public Schools (CPS) responds to all public records requests in accordance with the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 ILCS 140/1 et seq. \r\nDue to the volume and complexity of requests received in the normal course of business, CPS is extending the time for its initial response to your request by an additional 5 business days (to 10 business days total beginning on the first business day following receipt of the request) pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(e)(v) which allows for the examination and evaluation of the requested records by personnel to determine if they are exempt from disclosure under Section 7 of Illinois FOIA or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions. \r\nUpon the completion of a response, CPS will provide the first 50 pages to you at no charge. \u00a0If a response is more than 50 pages, a fee of 15\u00a2 per page will be charged for each additional page. Copies of video recordings have a fee of $48. All applicable fees must be paid prior to the copying. CPS will inform you of any fees due if your paper response exceeds 50 pages.

Provide a blank template letter for the 5 day unexcused absence letter; \r\n2. Provide a blank template letter for the 10 day unexcused absence letter; RESPONSE: Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\n3. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 5 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024; \r\n4. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 10 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024. RESPONSE: The CPS FOIA Office has reviewed your request with the CPS Office of Student Support and Engagement and the CPS School Administration & Health Services Team and has been advised that the information you seek is not comprehensively tracked centrally in the regular course of business. Be advised that while there is a system in place that advises schools of students who have had 5-day and 10-day unexcused absences, the correspondence that is to be sent out to parents is the responsibility of individual schools. As such, this information is not centrally tracked or can be counted. In order to provide you with information responsive to your request, a FOIA Officer would have to go to each school to conduct a search and create a new record which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. Specifically, creating records and answering questions is not required according to guidance provided by 5 ILCS 140/2(c). 5 ILCS 140/1, Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28, 32 (4 th Dist. 1989), and Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Additionally, under Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Further, section 1 of FOIA states in part: \u201cThis Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\u201d In accordance with Section 1 of the Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer your questions or prepare researched records on your behalf in response to your request. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Ana Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

If you are using a mobile device and are having trouble downloading or seeing the records, we recommend using a laptop or desktop computer to access the records. To open and review PDF documents you will need an application that can view PDF documents. \r\nThe KCSO is experiencing a high volume of open requests totaling 1,500. We anticipate our next installment to you by September 10, 2024 . If we are unable to meet this self-imposed disclosure date, we will let you know. If we are able to provide a response sooner, we will certainly do so. Your request is subject to fees as allowed under King County Ordinance 18949 and the Public Records Act, RCW 42.56.120 . Please visit our website  and select \"What is the cost to obtain records\" for more information. Once we have determined the scope of your request and responsive records, we may provide an estimate for fees requiring 10% down prior to processing your request. \r\nPLEASE NOTE: Per RCW 42.56.120(4), the KCSO reserves the right to close a records request after 30 days if a requester does not inspect, view, download, and/or pick up the records we provide. There is no obligation for us to continue producing records that are not being collected by a requester. \r\nRCW 42.56.120(4) states that if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. \r\nWAC 44-14-04006(1) states that a records request has been fulfilled and can be closed if an entirely unclear request has not been clarified, a request or installment has not been claimed or reviewed, or the requestor cancels the request. Please reply to this message or log in to the Online Request System if you have any questions or would like to clarify or cancel this request.

A copy of all guidelines, protocols, training materials, educational materials, and screening or diagnostic materials used by the university\u2019s athletics department related to the prevention of disordered eating, identification of student-athletes at risk of developing disordered eating, and establishing a chain of reporting for a student-athlete flagged as at risk for developing or exhibiting symptoms of disordered eating. Relevant keywords to this records search include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, relative energy deficiency, low energy availability, RED-S, and disordered eating.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees because I am a reporter for a widely read news site, Business Insider, and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of American universities\u2019 procedures for assisting student-athletes at risk of developing eating disorders. \r\n\r\nIn conducting your search, please use the most recent technologies and tools available. \r\n\r\nIf any part of our request is determined by your organization to be exempt from disclosure, please release any segregable non-exempt portions. If your organization determines that such segregation is impossible, please indicate why this is technically the case. If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the Georgia Open Records Act \u00a7 50.18.70 et seq.,. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees. \r\nPlease produce these records in the electronic format and share them with me via email at nparakul@insider.com, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThank you for your message. I submitted my request via MuckRock on January 10 2024. Below is a copy of the original request language:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Georgia Open Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. A copy of all guidelines, protocols, training materials, educational materials, and screening or diagnostic materials used by the university\u2019s athletics department related to the prevention of disordered eating, identification of student-athletes at risk of developing disordered eating, and establishing a chain of reporting for a student-athlete flagged as at risk for developing or exhibiting symptoms of disordered eating. Relevant keywords to this records search include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, relative energy deficiency, low energy availability, RED-S, and disordered eating.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees because I am a reporter for a widely read news site, Business Insider, and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of American universities\u2019 procedures for assisting student-athletes at risk of developing eating disorders.\r\n\r\nIn conducting your search, please use the most recent technologies and tools available.\r\n\r\nIf any part of our request is determined by your organization to be exempt from disclosure, please release any segregable non-exempt portions. If your organization determines that such segregation is impossible, please indicate why this is technically the case. If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the Georgia Open Records Act \u00a7 50.18.70 et seq.,. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees.\r\nPlease produce these records in the electronic format and share them with me via email at nparakul@insider.com, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nNarimes Parakul",
