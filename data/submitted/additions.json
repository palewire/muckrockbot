        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny bureau records related to the sexologist Li Shiu Tong (\u674e\u5146\u5802) born: January 9th 1907 - died: October 5th 1993). Li Shiu Tong was an LGBTQ activist in the early 20th century. Li Shiu Tong was a companion of a Jewish German sexologist named Magnus Hirschfeld who was forced into exile by the Nazis. \r\n\r\nLi Shiu Tong's colorful life and death in obscurity have been described in numerous articles online, such as this one:\r\n\r\nhttps://theconversation.com/the-asian-canadian-gay-activist-whose-theories-on-sexuality-were-decades-ahead-of-their-time-180834\r\n\r\nIn the 1940s, Li Shiu Tong enrolled at Harvard University and reportedly began engaging in gay rights advocacy. From the 1940s to 1974 he repeatedly entered the United States and enrolled in various universities. From 1974 until his death in 1993 Li Shiu Tong was a resident of Vancouver, Canada. It would logical to assume that a Chinese academic advocating for gay rights from the 1940s to the 1970s caught the bureau's attention. \r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the sexologist Li Shiu Tong (\u674e\u5146\u5802) from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Li Shiu Tong held by the Boston and Seattle field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Li Shiu Tong. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Li Shiu Tong.\r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Li Shiu Tong.\r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working together in having this request resolved. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
