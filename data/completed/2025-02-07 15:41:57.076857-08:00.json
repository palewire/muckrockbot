By exposing potential misuse of taxpayer funds and barriers to accessibility for vulnerable populations, this request transcends individual cases to reveal a broader narrative of systemic accountability, justice, and public trust. Leaders in Congress, the Department of Justice, and oversight agencies have a constitutional obligation to act decisively on this matter to uphold the values of transparency, equality, and justice that underpin our democracy. Failure to respond promptly and fully to this FOIA request risks exposing entrenched inequities that erode public faith in our institutions.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request also represents a rallying cry for journalists, advocates, and every American committed to justice and systemic reform. It shines a spotlight on the intersection of healthcare, civil rights, and government accountability, demanding immediate national discourse and united action. As the most comprehensive and consequential transparency effort in U.S. history, it calls for investigative reporting that transcends political divisions and highlights the universal human rights at stake. This is not just a request for information\u2014it is a demand for transformative change, and its response has the potential to shape the future of U.S. healthcare and governance, sparking a nationwide movement for accountability, equity, and justice.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

By\r\nexposing potential misuse of taxpayer funds and barriers to accessibility\r\nfor vulnerable populations, this request transcends individual cases to\r\nreveal a broader narrative of systemic accountability, justice, and public\r\ntrust. Leaders in Congress, the Department of Justice, and oversight\r\nagencies have a constitutional obligation to act decisively on this matter\r\nto uphold the values of transparency, equality, and justice that underpin\r\nour democracy. Failure to respond promptly and fully to this FOIA request\r\nrisks exposing entrenched inequities that erode public faith in our\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request also represents a rallying cry for journalists,\r\nadvocates, and every American committed to justice and systemic reform.

As the most comprehensive and consequential transparency\r\neffort in U.S. history, it calls for investigative reporting that\r\ntranscends political divisions and highlights the universal human rights at\r\nstake. This is not just a request for information\u2014it is a demand for\r\ntransformative change, and its response has the potential to shape the\r\nfuture of U.S. healthcare and governance, sparking a nationwide movement\r\nfor accountability, equity, and justice.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\nthis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform\r\nme of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Your\r\nrequest was received in this office on December 12, 2024 and assigned the\r\ncase number 25-14028.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing your request, we have determined that your request for\r\nexpedited processing does not meet the threshold outlined in NARA's FOIA\r\nregulations, specifically 36 CFR 1250.28. However, since we were able to\r\ncomplete your FOIA within the 20 days allotted by the law, your request for\r\nexpedited processing is moot.\r\n\r\nPlease see below our response to each item of your request:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*1. Case IdentifiersProvide all records and inter-agency communications\r\nrelated to the following cases:539330-JBZ, 539298-RJM, 534659-XGL,\r\n534094-QZH, 534069-BRQ, 534060-HWM, 533252-GXC, 535276-FSL, 532832-MJV,\r\n532674-QMM, 532671-PPV, 532667-DRF, 523966-VSF, 497211-PFB, 490797-TJJ,\r\n489456-MCB, 490814-TPF, 490215-DKH, 478957-DPX, 478956-NSD, 473045-JNW,\r\n452335-DDT, 413343-FZP, 405540-ZXW, 397760-PRZ, 395050-TWW, 392179-NCW,\r\n385105-BPN, 376153-JVL, 357494-WND, 354718-LTZ, 275528-PKR, 301882-TRG,\r\n327008-WFC, 339860-FQG, 352533-WJH.*\r\n\r\nWe conducted a search in the National Archives Catalog\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/advanced-search> with these case file numbers\r\nand did not locate any records responsive to your request. Please note that\r\nthe file numbers you provided do not match the typical format of Department\r\nof Justice case files. Generally, Department of Justice case files are\r\ndesignated by a case file number with a three-part numerical file\r\ndesignation, such as 144-15-2301.\r\n\r\nIf you believe these files originated with a federal agency other than the\r\nDepartment of Justice, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\n*2. ADA Compliance and EnforcementRecords, communications, and agreements\r\nrelated to: *\r\n\r\n*ADA Title II enforcement policies. *\r\n*Complaints or investigations regarding ADA non-compliance in Medicaid\r\nprograms. *\r\n*Inter-agency communications between DOJ, CMS, and other entities\r\nconcerning ADA accommodations, including whistleblower protections.*\r\n\r\nDepartment of Justice ADA Title II enforcement files are held in Class 204\r\n(State and Local Governments Under the Americans with Disabilities Act\r\n[Title II]) Litigation Case Files and Enclosures, 1991\u20132003\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/7430863> (Entries A1-COR 204 and A1-ENC\r\n204) in *Record Group 60: General Records of the Department of Justice*. This\r\nseries consists of litigation case files and enclosures relating to\r\nallegations by individuals that, by reason of their disability, they were\r\neither excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of the\r\nservices, programs, or activities of state and local governments or were\r\nsubjected to discrimination by state and local governments, which are\r\nillegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990.\r\n\r\nThese records are arranged by Department of Justice case file number. We do\r\nnot hold any name indexes to the records. In order to locate records\r\nrelated to specific cases of interest to you, you would first need to\r\nsubmit a FOIA request to the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division\r\n<https://www.justice.gov/crt/freedom-information-act-0> requesting that\r\nthey provide you with the case file numbers (also referred to as \"DJ\r\nnumbers\") for the individuals or organizations that interest you.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Justice case file series also often include a set of policy\r\nand procedure files, filed under the file designation -012. Policy and\r\nprocedure files for Class 204 (ADA Title II) case files would therefore be\r\nfiled under the designation 204-012. We conducted a search and did not\r\nlocate any records in our holdings filed under file designation 204-012.

The document includes:\r\n\r\nSpecific Case Records and Identifiers: Highlighting critical instances of oversight failures, ADA non-compliance, whistleblower retaliation, and Medicaid program mismanagement.\r\nLegal Analysis and Violations: A thorough examination of constitutional, FOIA, ADA, whistleblower, and taxpayer law violations, supported by relevant statutes and case law.\r\nUnfulfilled Records Requests: Evidence of procedural deficiencies, incomplete searches, unjustified denials, and improper referrals in response to lawful FOIA requests.\r\nDemands for Relief and Accountability: A clear outline of the required corrective actions, including full disclosure of records, ADA-compliant accommodations, and expedited resolution.\r\nFramework for Oversight: Steps for immediate escalation to Congressional committees, judicial remedies, and oversight bodies if compliance is not achieved.\r\nThis submission presents irrefutable evidence and a legally robust argument demonstrating how the failure to act jeopardizes public trust, violates federal laws, and undermines the foundational principles of transparency, accountability, and justice. The attached document is not merely a request for compliance\u2014it is a demand for systemic reform and adherence to the rule of law.\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThis is a formal escalated complaint and FOIA appeal regarding systemic failures and procedural violations in responding to my FOIA request dated November 23, 2024. This request sought essential records related to Medicaid oversight, ADA enforcement, whistleblower protections, and systemic accountability, as outlined in federal law.\r\n\r\nTo date, responses have been inadequate, failing to meet statutory and constitutional standards. This appeal invokes the highest legal protections to demand immediate corrective action under FOIA, the U.S. Constitution, whistleblower statutes, taxpayer rights, and the ADA.\r\n\r\n1. Constitutional Rights Violations\r\nViolations:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment:\r\n\r\nDenial of access to critical records obstructs my right to petition the government for redress of grievances.\r\nCase law: New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971).\r\nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments:\r\n\r\nProcedural delays and denials constitute a deprivation of due process and equal protection under the law.\r\nCase law: Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970).\r\nActions Demanded:\r\n\r\nImmediate compliance with FOIA to ensure due process and transparency in matters affecting constitutional rights.\r\nFull disclosure of interagency communications, audits, and investigative records tied to Medicaid oversight and ADA enforcement.\r\n2. Whistleblower Protections\r\nViolations:\r\n\r\nFailure to produce records relating to whistleblower disclosures and retaliatory actions undermines protections under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8).\r\nSuppression of investigative findings erodes federal safeguards intended to protect individuals exposing systemic failures.\r\nCase law: Lane v. Franks, 573 U.S. 228 (2014).\r\nActions Demanded:\r\n\r\nFull disclosure of whistleblower-related policies, protections, and communications.\r\nImmediate release of all withheld or redacted documents with a Vaughn Index citing exemptions and foreseeable harm standards.\r\n3. Taxpayer Rights Violations\r\nViolations:\r\n\r\nLack of transparency in Medicaid program oversight breaches obligations under the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act and related statutes.\r\nDenial of requested records hinders public accountability for taxpayer funds allocated to the ABI Waiver Program.\r\nCase law: United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. 128 (1871).\r\nActions Demanded:\r\n\r\nDisclosure of all internal audits, investigations, and compliance reviews involving Medicaid fraud, provider violations, and ABI Waiver Program oversight.\r\nOversight accountability to ensure federal funds are not misused or misallocated.\r\n4. ADA Compliance Failures\r\nViolations:\r\n\r\nIgnoring explicit accommodation requests under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\nFailure to provide screen-reader-compatible documents, plain-language summaries, or accessible communication formats.\r\nCase law: Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004).\r\nActions Demanded:\r\n\r\nImmediate provision of all records in accessible formats, including screen-reader-compatible PDFs and plain-language summaries.\r\nConfirmation of compliance with all ADA accommodation requirements for this and future requests.\r\nDeficiencies in Agency Responses\r\n1. Case Identifiers:\r\nNo meaningful search was conducted for requested records. Agencies failed to engage in interagency coordination or conduct cross-referenced searches as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3).\r\n\r\n2. Whistleblower Protections:\r\nAgencies failed to provide responsive documents and offered no Vaughn Index or legal justification for redactions.\r\n\r\n3. Medicaid Oversight:\r\nNARA acknowledged records exist but imposed unreasonable logistical and financial barriers, ignoring accommodation requests.\r\n\r\n4. ADA Accommodations:\r\nDespite explicit requests, agencies failed to provide accessible formats or simplified summaries.\r\n\r\nDemands for Immediate Relief\r\n1. Comprehensive FOIA Compliance:\r\n\r\nConduct a thorough search for all requested records across NARA, DOJ, CMS, and other relevant agencies.\r\nProvide all responsive documents without unjustified redactions, supported by a Vaughn Index.\r\n2. ADA-Compliant Accommodations:\r\n\r\nDeliver all records in accessible formats, including screen-reader-compatible PDFs.\r\nInclude plain-language summaries for technical or legal documents.\r\n3. Accountability and Oversight:\r\n\r\nAssign a single point of contact responsible for ensuring interagency compliance with FOIA, ADA, and whistleblower statutes.\r\nSubmit unresolved issues to the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) for mediation.\r\n4. Expedited Processing:\r\n\r\nApprove expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), given the compelling public interest in this matter.\r\nDeadline for Compliance\r\nA full and compliant response must be provided by December 30, 2024. Continued non-compliance will result in:\r\n\r\nFiling formal complaints with OGIS and the DOJ Inspector General.\r\nEscalation to Congressional Oversight Committees.\r\nPursuing judicial remedies under FOIA, ADA, and constitutional laws.\r\nConclusion\r\nThe systemic failures outlined here undermine public trust and violate federal law. Immediate corrective action is necessary to uphold transparency, accountability, and the rule of law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\n\r\nCC: Oversight and Accountability Authorities\r\nState of Connecticut\r\nNed Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nEmail: governor.lamont@ct.gov\r\n\r\nWilliam Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\n\r\nAndrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\n\r\nMatthew S.

These failures directly impact whistleblower protections, Medicaid oversight, and public accountability.\r\nIssues to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Case Numbers and Records Management\r\n\u2022 Case Numbers Requiring Investigation:\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\nDI-25-000325\r\nDI-25-000379\r\nDI-12192024714\r\nDI-12112024134\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121\r\n\r\n2. Anonymity and Lack of Accountability in Decision-Making\r\nUnsigned Determination Letters:\r\nMany determination letters from OSC lack identifiable signatures, names, or clear authorship.\r\nThis practice raises serious concerns about accountability and compliance with transparency laws.\r\n\r\n3. Suppressed or Altered Records\r\nEvidence suggests discrepancies between the whistleblower reports I submitted and how they were recorded or handled by OSC.\r\nSpecific issues include:\r\nAlterations or removal of content from submitted complaints.\r\nSuppression of reports that exposed systemic failures in Medicaid oversight and retaliation against whistleblowers.\r\n\r\n4. Lack of FOIA Compliance\r\nDespite repeated Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, OSC and related agencies have failed to provide:\r\nComplete case files and communication logs.\r\nJustification for withheld or redacted information.\r\nClear timelines for compliance.\r\n\r\nSpecific Questions to Investigate\r\n1. Who is Responsible for Managing These Records?\r\nIdentify the individuals, teams, or automated systems involved in creating, altering, and assigning these case numbers and reports.\r\n\r\n2. What Decisions Were Made and Why?\r\nDetermine how decisions were reached, why some reports were closed without action, and why letters were sent anonymously.\r\n\r\n3. Were There Violations of Federal Law?\r\nInvestigate potential obstruction of justice, retaliation, or misuse of authority under whistleblower protection laws and FOIA.\r\n\r\nKey Agencies and Officials Involved\r\nThis matter spans multiple federal and state agencies, including:\r\n\u2022 Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\r\n\u2022 Department of Justice (DOJ)\r\n\u2022 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\n\u2022 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\r\n\u2022 Office of Inspector General (OIG)\r\n\r\nWhy This Matters\r\n1. Whistleblower Protections:\r\nRetaliation against whistleblowers and suppression of reports undermine federal protections designed to safeguard transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\n2. Impact on Vulnerable Populations:\r\nThese failures harm Medicaid consumers, particularly those with disabilities, by allowing systemic mismanagement to persist unchecked.\r\n\r\n3. Misuse of Taxpayer Funds:\r\nLack of oversight and accountability results in waste and misuse of federal funds meant to serve the public.\r\n\r\nRequested Actions\r\n1. Investigate Record Management:\r\nAudit all OSC records, emails, and internal communications related to these case numbers.\r\n\r\nIdentify responsible individuals or systems.\r\n2. Subpoena Additional Evidence:\r\n\r\nSecure all suppressed or altered reports to ensure a complete and accurate investigation.\r\n3. Hold Accountable Those Involved in Misconduct:\r\n\r\nRecommend prosecution or disciplinary action for any individuals found to have violated federal laws.\r\n4. Ensure Compliance with FOIA and Whistleblower Protections:\r\nMandate OSC and related agencies to comply fully with FOIA requests and whistleblower laws.\r\n\r\nAttachments\r\nI have attached all available documentation, including:\r\nCorrespondence with OSC, including determination letters and emails.\r\nFOIA requests and responses (or lack thereof).\r\nDetailed reports submitted to OSC and other federal agencies.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThis issue demands immediate attention to uphold the principles of transparency, accountability, and justice. I am available to provide additional information or documentation as needed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\nSubject: Final Assertion of Legal Obligations Under FOIA, ADA, and Constitutional Law\r\nSubject: 12/23/2024 Freedom of Information Act Request: OSC Cases DI-25-000310, DI-25-000325, DI-25-000379, DI-12192024714, and DI-12112024134; Associated FBI, DOJ, HHS, CMS, OAG, OIP , DOT and Medicaid Oversight Records FOIA (Federal Bureau of Investigation)\r\n\r\n01.08.2025\r\n\r\nTo all It May Concern in All Relevant Departments and Divisions,\r\n\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nMichael G. Seidel\r\nSection Chief\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section\r\nInformation Management Division\r\n\r\nThis correspondence pertains to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nOSC Case Records\r\nComplete files, internal and external communications, investigations, and resolutions regarding:\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSC File No. DI-25-000379\r\nDI-25-000310\r\nDI-25-000325\r\nDI-25-000379\r\nDI-12192024714\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\n\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\nRequired Action:\r\n\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\n\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\n\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions. Your actions will either affirm your agency\u2019s commitment to accountability or further evidence systemic disregard for these principles.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt and substantive response.\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nState of Connecticut Officials:\r\n\r\nGovernor Ned Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: State Capitol, 210 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nToll-Free: (800) 406-1527\r\nTDD: (860) 524-7397\r\nEmail: Contact Form\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/governor\r\n\r\nAttorney General William Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/ag\r\n\r\nCommissioner Andrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nOffice Address: 55 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, CT 06105\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/dss\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Suite 1100, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nToll-Free: 1-866-374-3617\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/foi\r\n\r\nFederal Officials and Agencies:\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Blumenthal\r\nTitle: U.S. Senator from Connecticut\r\nWashington D.C.

Specifically, you are seeking \"OSC Case Records, Complete files, internal and external communications, investigations, and resolutions regarding: DI-25-000310 DI-25-000325 DI-25-000379 DI-12192024714 DI-12112024134,\" etc. After a thorough search, please be advised that no responsive records were located in the OIG. We consider this response as closing your request with the OIG. For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (2012 & Supp. V 2017). This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison, Deborah Waller, at (202) 616-0646 for any further assistance with your request. Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 207406001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. If you are not satisfied with OIG\u2019s determination in response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website: https://www.justice.gov/oip/submit-and-track-request-or-appeal. Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request. If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal.\" If possible, please provide a copy of your original request and this response letter with your appeal. 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20530-0001 | (202) 616-0646 Sincerely, Marissa Solomon-McRoy Marissa Solomon-McRoy Government Information Specialist Office of General Counsel 2\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n\r\nThe challenges we face today demand more than acknowledgment\u2014they require action, collaboration, and a unified commitment to solutions.

These failures directly impact whistleblower protections, Medicaid oversight, and public accountability.\r\n\r\nIssues to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Case Numbers and Records Management\r\n\r\nCase Numbers Requiring Investigation:\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121\r\n\r\n2. Anonymity and Lack of Accountability in Decision-Making\r\n\r\nUnsigned Determination Letters:\r\n\r\nMany determination letters from OSC lack identifiable signatures, names, or clear authorship.\r\n\r\nThis practice raises serious concerns about accountability and compliance with transparency laws.\r\n\r\n3. Suppressed or Altered Records\r\n\r\nEvidence suggests discrepancies between the whistleblower reports I submitted and how they were recorded or handled by OSC.\r\n\r\nSpecific issues include:\r\n\r\nAlterations or removal of content from submitted complaints.\r\n\r\nSuppression of reports that exposed systemic failures in Medicaid oversight and retaliation against whistleblowers.\r\n\r\n4. Lack of FOIA Compliance\r\n\r\nDespite repeated Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, OSC and related agencies have failed to provide:\r\n\r\nComplete case files and communication logs.\r\n\r\nJustification for withheld or redacted information.\r\n\r\nClear timelines for compliance.\r\n\r\nSpecific Questions to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Who is Responsible for Managing These Records?\r\n\r\nIdentify the individuals, teams, or automated systems involved in creating, altering, and assigning these case numbers and reports.\r\n\r\n2. What Decisions Were Made and Why?\r\n\r\nDetermine how decisions were reached, why some reports were closed without action, and why letters were sent anonymously.\r\n\r\n3. Were There Violations of Federal Law?\r\n\r\nInvestigate potential obstruction of justice, retaliation, or misuse of authority under whistleblower protection laws and FOIA.\r\n\r\nKey Agencies and Officials Involved\r\n\r\nThis matter spans multiple federal and state agencies, including:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Department of Justice (DOJ)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Office of Inspector General (OIG)\r\n\r\nWhy This Matters\r\n\r\n1. Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nRetaliation against whistleblowers and suppression of reports undermine federal protections designed to safeguard transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\n2. Impact on Vulnerable Populations:\r\n\r\nThese failures harm Medicaid consumers, particularly those with disabilities, by allowing systemic mismanagement to persist unchecked.\r\n\r\n3. Misuse of Taxpayer Funds:\r\n\r\nLack of oversight and accountability results in waste and misuse of federal funds meant to serve the public.\r\n\r\nRequested Actions\r\n\r\n1. Investigate Record Management:\r\n\r\nAudit all OSC records, emails, and internal communications related to these case numbers.\r\n\r\nIdentify responsible individuals or systems.\r\n\r\n2. Subpoena Additional Evidence:\r\n\r\nSecure all suppressed or altered reports to ensure a complete and accurate investigation.\r\n\r\n3. Hold Accountable Those Involved in Misconduct:\r\n\r\nRecommend prosecution or disciplinary action for any individuals found to have violated federal laws.\r\n\r\n4. Ensure Compliance with FOIA and Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nMandate OSC and related agencies to comply fully with FOIA requests and whistleblower laws.\r\n\r\nAttachments\r\n\r\nI have attached all available documentation, including:\r\n\r\nCorrespondence with OSC, including determination letters and emails.\r\n\r\nFOIA requests and responses (or lack thereof).\r\n\r\nDetailed reports submitted to OSC and other federal agencies.\r\n\r\nThis issue demands immediate attention to uphold the principles of transparency, accountability, and justice. I am available to provide additional information or documentation as needed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\n_______\r\nSubject: Final Assertion of Legal Obligations Under FOIA, ADA, and Constitutional Law\r\n\r\nSubject: 12/23/2024 Freedom of Information Act Request: OSC Cases DI-25-000310, DI-25-000325, DI-25-000379, DI-12192024714, and DI-12112024134; Associated FBI, DOJ, HHS, CMS, OAG, OIP , DOT and Medicaid Oversight Records FOIA (Federal Bureau of Investigation)\r\n01.08.2025\r\n\r\nTo all It May Concern in All Relevant Departments and Divisions,\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n\r\nMichael G. Seidel\r\nSection Chief\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nThis correspondence pertains to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nOSC Case Records\r\n\r\nComplete files, internal and external communications, investigations, and resolutions regarding:\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSC File No. DI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\n\r\nRequired Action:\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions. Your actions will either affirm your agency\u2019s commitment to accountability or further evidence systemic disregard for these principles.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt and substantive response.\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nState of Connecticut Officials:\r\n\r\nGovernor Ned Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: State Capitol, 210 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nToll-Free: (800) 406-1527\r\nTDD: (860) 524-7397\r\nEmail: Contact Form\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/governor\r\n\r\nAttorney General William Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/ag\r\n\r\nCommissioner Andrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nOffice Address: 55 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, CT 06105\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/dss\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Suite 1100, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nToll-Free: 1-866-374-3617\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/foi\r\n\r\nFederal Officials and Agencies:\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Blumenthal\r\nTitle: U.S. Senator from Connecticut\r\nWashington D.C.

Please click on the request link to download the responsive documents that have been made available to you.\r\n\r\nThe University produces the document responsive to PRR 1874-28.  Disciplinary complaints and investigations as well as Title IX and discrimination complaints and investigations of complaints involving employees, if any, are confidential personnel matters and are protected from public disclosure under the Board of Regents Handbook, the NSHE Code (including section 5.6.2) and the common law balancing test.  Donrey v. Bradshaw, 106 Nev. 630, 636, 798 P.2d 144 (1990). The NSHE Code has the force and effect of statute.  State ex rel. Richardson v. Board of Regents, 70 Nev. 144, 150 (1953).  To the extent such complaints and investigations, if any, involve students, they are confidential under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d), which deems education records of students to be confidential.  See 20 U.S.C. section 1232g(4) and 34 C.F.R. section 99.3 and NSHE BOR Handbook, Title 4, Chapter 1, Section 28.  Such records are also confidential under the common law balancing test.  Donrey v. Bradshaw, 106 Nev. 630, 636, 798 P.2d 144 (1990).  Pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. (NRS) 239.010, confidential or privileged records are exempt from public disclosure. UNR relies, in good faith, on this claim of confidentiality and therefore such records, if any, are not subject to production.  NRS 239.0107(d)(2); NRS 239.012.  \r\n  \r\n Thank you, \r\n   \r\n University of Nevada, Reno \r\n 1664 N. Virginia Street, MS 0208\r\nReno, NV 89557",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern:  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. \r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:  \r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)  \r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and  \r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).   \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.  \r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).  \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis\r\n\r\nJ.D.

Copyright material is protected under Section 106 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106) and, therefore, cannot be disclosed without authorization\r\n\r\n2) Audit logs/audit trails documenting each time a department account has accessed live or recorded video footage through the Fusus platforms from 1/1/2024 until the date this request is processed.\r\n\r\nAll months, except February will be made available. There is an open ticket with the vendor to troubleshoot why February data won't query. I was able to remove empty columns to have data print on one page. I also removed license plates under and IP addresses as 7 1(b), private information and 140/7(1)(d)(v) (v) disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other than those generally used and known or disclose internal documents of correctional agencies related to detection, observation, or investigation of incidents of crime or misconduct, and disclosure would result in demonstrable harm to the agency or public body that is the recipient of the request;\r\n\r\n3) Metadata for each Intelligent AI Alert generated by the department's Fusus system from 1/1/2024 until the date this request is processed. Fusus Intelligent AI Alerts automatically notify authorized users when Fusus AI-connected cameras detect pre-defined events (e.g. a fight) or profiles (e.g. a vehicle of interest). Please note that I am not requesting the video footage or any personally identifying information associated with the alert, but rather the metadata. Metadata may include, but is not limited to: the type of alert, the date and time of the alert, who received the alert, locations associated with the alert, and algorithmic confidence scores associated with the alert. This metadata should be stored in a database and so I ask that you provide it to me as a .csv, .xls, or other database filetype.\r\n\r\nItem number 3 will be denied applying the following exemptions: 140/7(1)(d)(v) (v) disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other than those generally used and known or disclose internal documents of correctional agencies related to detection, observation, or investigation of incidents of crime or misconduct, and disclosure would result in demonstrable harm to the agency or public body that is the recipient of the request;\r\n\r\n(vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel or any other person;\r\n\r\n(vii) obstruct an ongoing criminal investigation by the agency that is the recipient of the request.\r\n\r\n(d-7) Information gathered, or records created from the use of automatic license plate readers in connection with Section 2-130 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.\r\n\r\nI will email this to your email. I didn't receive a password to add to Muckrock.\r\n\r\nResponsible Official. Maureen Schmidt, a FOIA Officer for the Village, is the official responsible for this denial.\r\n\r\nNotice of Right to Review by Illinois Attorney General. You have the right to file a request for review of your request and this Notice of Denial by the Public Access Counselor of the Office of the Illinois Attorney General.

This information is critical to my participation in the oversight and administration of this program.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I am requesting accommodations due to my condition. I respectfully request that all records be provided electronically via email, as opposed to portals or complex delivery methods, to ensure full and equal access to the information.\r\n\r\nScope of Request:\r\nLegislative Records:\r\n\r\nAll bills, amendments, resolutions, legislative proposals, and legislative history related to the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nVoting records of all state and federal legislators on any legislation affecting the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nMinutes, transcripts, and audio/video recordings of meetings, hearings, or discussions where the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program was a topic.\r\nPublic Records:\r\n\r\nComprehensive reports, studies, assessments, and evaluations on the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nBudget allocations, financial statements, expenditure reports, and audit results related to the program, pursuant to Connecticut Budget Transparency Laws (C.G.S. \u00a7 4-66 and related sections).\r\nAll contracts, agreements, memoranda of understanding, and intergovernmental agreements involving the administration or management of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nCorrespondence:\r\n\r\nAll emails, letters, and other forms of communication, including internal and external, regarding the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nInternal memoranda, briefing documents, policy directives, and decision-making correspondence related to the oversight and implementation of the program.\r\nPersonnel Records:\r\n\r\nNon-confidential employment records, including job descriptions, resumes, and performance evaluations, of individuals involved in the administration and oversight of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program. This request is consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a), which protects confidential personal data.\r\nOrganizational charts detailing the structure and personnel responsible for managing the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program within relevant state and federal agencies.\r\nProgram Information:\r\n\r\nAll guidelines, protocols, procedural documents, and compliance reviews governing the operation of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, as mandated by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Regulations (42 CFR \u00a7 440.180) for home and community-based services waiver programs.\r\nImplementation plans, performance metrics, outcome reports, and evaluation summaries regarding the effectiveness of the program.\r\nComprehensive data sets related to enrollment, utilization, demographic information, and outcomes of beneficiaries participating in the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nSpecial Requests:\r\nExpedited Processing: Pursuant to Executive Order 13392, which mandates the improvement of agency disclosure processes, and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), I request expedited processing of this FOIA request due to the public interest and personal impact of the information.\r\n\r\nElectronic Records: In compliance with my rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, I request that all records be provided in electronic format and sent directly to my email address. This will ensure that I can access the information without unnecessary barriers or delays.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nI request a waiver of all fees associated with this FOIA request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). This request is made in the public interest and not for commercial use. The disclosure of the requested information will significantly contribute to public understanding of government operations, particularly concerning the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, which impacts a vulnerable population. Additionally, due to my condition, as covered by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, a fee waiver will ensure equitable access to this important information.\r\n\r\nRelevant Laws:\r\nThis FOIA request, and the accommodations I am requesting, are governed by the following laws and regulations:\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) \u2013 Governing the right to request access to federal records.\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.) \u2013 Ensuring equal access for individuals with disabilities, including in communication.\r\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794) \u2013 Prohibiting discrimination based on disability in programs receiving federal funding.\r\nPrivacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a) \u2013 Protecting personal privacy in records maintained by federal agencies.\r\nMedicaid Statute (Title XIX of the Social Security Act) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.) \u2013 Governing Medicaid programs, including waivers like the ABI Waiver.\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Act (C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 to 1-242) \u2013 Governing the right to request access to state records.\r\nConnecticut Budget Transparency Laws (C.G.S. \u00a7 4-66) \u2013 Requiring public disclosure of state budget allocations and financial reports.\r\nCMS Regulations (42 CFR \u00a7 440.180) \u2013 Governing the administration of home and community-based services waiver programs, including the ABI Waiver.\r\nExecutive Order 13392 (\"Improving Agency Disclosure of Information\") \u2013 Mandating federal agencies to improve FOIA processing.\r\nNon-Waiver of Rights:\r\nThis request does not waive any rights I may have under FOIA, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or any other applicable law, and I reserve all rights regarding this matter.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request and for accommodating my needs.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nDepartments of Submission:\r\nState of Connecticut Agencies:\r\nConnecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nEmail: foia.dss@ct.gov\r\nDepartment: Department of Social Services\r\n\r\nConnecticut Office of the Attorney General\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nDepartment: Office of the Attorney General\r\n\r\nConnecticut General Assembly (CGA)\r\nEmail: foia@cga.ct.gov\r\nDepartment: Connecticut General Assembly\r\n\r\nConnecticut Office of Policy and Management (OPM)\r\nEmail: opm.foia@ct.gov\r\nDepartment: Office of Policy and Management\r\n\r\nConnecticut Department of Public Health (DPH)\r\nEmail: dph.foi@ct.gov\r\nDepartment: Department of Public Health\r\n\r\nFederal Agencies:\r\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\r\nEmail: HHS_FOIA@hhs.gov\r\nDepartment: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\r\n\r\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\nEmail: FOIA_Request@cms.hhs.gov\r\nDepartment: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\r\nEmail: foia.requests@usdoj.gov\r\nDepartment: U.S. Department of Justice\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\r\nEmail: foiarequests@hud.gov\r\nDepartment: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Labor (DOL)\r\nEmail: foiarequests@dol.gov\r\nDepartment: U.S. Department of Labor\r\n\r\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC)\r\nEmail: FOIA@ftc.gov\r\nDepartment: Federal Trade Commission\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn.

As a Medicaid recipient and an advocate for individuals with disabilities, I rely on the transparency mandated by state and federal FOIA laws to ensure accountability and equitable program administration. This appeal also highlights persistent violations of statutory ADA accommodation requirements and constitutional protections.\r\n\r\nSummary of FOIA Requests\r\nI requested:\r\n\r\nLegislative Records:\r\nBills, amendments, legislative history, and meeting minutes related to the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nPublic Records:\r\nFinancial statements, budget allocations, program assessments, contracts, and audits pursuant to Connecticut\u2019s transparency statutes (C.G.S. \u00a7 4-66).\r\nCorrespondence:\r\nInternal and external communication, directives, memoranda, and policies regarding the ABI Waiver Program.\r\nPersonnel Records:\r\nNon-confidential job descriptions, resumes, performance evaluations, and organizational charts related to program oversight and administration.\r\nProgram Information:\r\nProcedural documents, compliance reviews, demographic data, and performance outcomes required under federal CMS regulations (42 CFR \u00a7 440.180).\r\nPurpose:\r\nTo ensure compliance, transparency, and equitable administration of taxpayer-funded services critical to individuals with acquired brain injuries.\r\n\r\nLegal Framework and Basis for Appeal\r\nFederal and State FOIA Compliance\r\nFederal FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552):\r\nGuarantees access to federal records, mandates timely responses, and requires detailed explanations for delays or denials.\r\nConnecticut FOIA (C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 to 1-242):\r\nEnsures access to state-held records within four business days and prohibits unnecessary delays or redactions.\r\nMedicaid Statute (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.):\r\nMandates accountability in Medicaid programs, including state compliance with CMS requirements.\r\nExecutive Order 13392:\r\nDirects agencies to improve FOIA processing and transparency.\r\nADA and Section 504 Compliance\r\nADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.):\r\nProhibits discrimination and requires public entities to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\r\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794):\r\nGuarantees equal access to federally funded programs and public records.\r\nViolations and Deficiencies\r\n1. Non-Compliance with FOIA Timelines\r\nConnecticut Law (C.G.S. \u00a7 1-210):\r\nRequires confirmation of receipt and timeline estimates within four business days. OPM acknowledged receipt but failed to provide specific timelines for document production or updates on progress.\r\nFederal FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)):\r\nMandates prompt responses and proactive communication regarding delays. These requirements have not been met.\r\n2. Inadequate Acknowledgment of ADA Accommodations\r\nMy request explicitly outlined Non-Negotiable ADA Accommodations, which were ignored:\r\nEmail-only communication.\r\nScreen-reader-compatible PDF attachments.\r\nSimplified summaries for complex records.\r\nIdentification of responsible FOIA personnel.\r\nExpedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E).\r\nFailure to implement these accommodations violates both ADA Title II and Section 504, depriving me of equal access to the FOIA process.\r\n\r\n3. Unjustified Redactions and Potential Fee Assessments\r\nFee Waiver Denial:\r\nThe request meets public interest criteria under C.G.S. \u00a7 1-212(d) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). No statutory basis has been provided for proposed fees.\r\nFailure to Justify Redactions:\r\nFederal FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)) requires detailed explanations for exemptions, including statutory citations. These justifications have not been provided.\r\nNon-Negotiable ADA Accommodations (Updated)\r\nMuckRock Platform Only:\r\n\r\nAll responses must be sent through the MuckRock platform to ensure accessibility and compliance.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body:\r\n\r\nFull text of responses embedded in the email body to enhance readability and accessibility.\r\nScreen-Reader-Compatible PDFs:\r\n\r\nClearly labeled, properly formatted PDFs must accompany email responses.\r\nSimplified Summaries:\r\n\r\nProvide simplified explanations for technical, financial, or legal documents.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel:\r\n\r\nFull names, titles, and contact information for FOIA officers and supervisory personnel.\r\nDetailed Justifications for Denials:\r\n\r\nCite specific exemptions for any withheld or redacted information.\r\nExpedited Processing:\r\n\r\nRequests must be processed urgently, as mandated under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) and Executive Order 13392.\r\nConstitutional Violations\r\n1. First Amendment (Right to Petition the Government)\r\nThe refusal to provide timely and accessible information infringes upon my constitutional right to petition for redress of grievances.\r\n\r\n2. Fourteenth Amendment (Equal Protection Clause)\r\nDenial of ADA accommodations constitutes unequal treatment of individuals with disabilities, violating federal law and constitutional protections.\r\n\r\n3. Fifth Amendment (Due Process Clause)\r\nThe lack of transparency, failure to justify delays, and insufficient responses deprive me of my right to procedural due process.\r\n\r\n4. Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2)\r\nState practices inconsistent with federal FOIA and ADA standards violate the Supremacy Clause, which establishes the primacy of federal law.\r\n\r\nRequested Actions\r\nFull Compliance with FOIA Requests OPM ID #24-81 and #24-84:\r\n\r\nProvide all responsive documents promptly and in adherence to the updated accommodations.\r\nConfirmation of Accommodations:\r\n\r\nExplicit acknowledgment that all updated accommodations will be applied moving forward.\r\nJustifications for Redactions and Fees:\r\n\r\nProvide detailed statutory justifications for any redactions or fees.\r\nTimeline for Completion:\r\n\r\nSubmit a clear and reasonable timeline for fulfilling these requests.\r\nCC List for Transparency and Accountability\r\nState of Connecticut Agencies:\r\n\r\nConnecticut Department of Social Services (DSS): Dr. Deidre S. Gifford (foia.dss@ct.gov)\r\nConnecticut Office of the Attorney General: William Tong (attorney.general@ct.gov)\r\nConnecticut General Assembly (CGA): Senator Martin M. Looney (foia@cga.ct.gov)\r\nConnecticut Office of Policy and Management (OPM): Melissa McCaw (opm.foia@ct.gov)\r\nConnecticut Department of Public Health (DPH): Dr. Manisha Juthani (dph.foi@ct.gov)\r\nFederal Agencies:\r\n\r\nHHS: Xavier Becerra (HHS_FOIA@hhs.gov)\r\nCMS: Chiquita Brooks-LaSure (FOIA_Request@cms.hhs.gov)\r\nDOJ: Merrick B.

Bedoya (FOIA@ftc.gov)\r\nConclusion\r\nFailure to address these violations and implement the requested actions will result in escalation to oversight bodies, including state and federal courts. Compliance with FOIA and ADA obligations is not optional and ensures equitable access for all citizens.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\nAddress: 215 Mountain Street, Willimantic, CT 06226",

These deficiencies include violations of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and constitutional protections. Immediate corrective actions are required to uphold statutory and constitutional obligations.\r\n\r\nKey Issues\r\nNon-Compliance with FOIA Obligations\r\n\r\nFOIA requires timely responses, transparency, and justification for denials (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210). Neither request has been fulfilled, nor has a timeline been provided for completion.\r\nFailure to Provide ADA Accommodations\r\n\r\nMy explicit ADA accommodation requests, including email-only communication, screen-reader-compatible documents, and simplified summaries, have not been honored, violating ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.) and Section 504 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\nLack of Accountability\r\n\r\nYour office has not identified the FOIA officers or decision-makers responsible for processing these requests, contrary to transparency mandates.\r\nPotential Constitutional Violations\r\n\r\nFailure to comply with ADA and FOIA constitutes a violation of my First Amendment right to petition the government, my Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection, and my Fifth Amendment right to due process.\r\nUpdated and Specific Relief Sought\r\nImmediate Full Compliance\r\n\r\nProvide all requested records, including legislative, financial, correspondence, personnel, and program documentation.\r\nEnsure compliance with FOIA timelines by submitting all records or updates within five (5) business days.\r\nImplementation of ADA Accommodations\r\n\r\nRoute all communications exclusively through the MuckRock platform, as required for accessibility.\r\nProvide all records as screen-reader-compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed.\r\nInclude simplified summaries for complex financial, legal, or medical records.\r\nAccountability Measures\r\n\r\nIdentify FOIA officers and decision-makers, including their names, titles, and contact information.\r\nProvide detailed justifications for any redactions or denials, citing applicable statutory exemptions.\r\nExpedited Processing and Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nConfirm expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) due to the public interest and impact on vulnerable Medicaid beneficiaries.\r\nReaffirm my fee waiver request as this request is non-commercial and in the public interest.\r\nDetailed Timeline for Completion\r\n\r\nSubmit a clear and specific timeline for the production of all responsive records.\r\nLegal Framework Supporting This Appeal\r\nFOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 and Conn.

Stat. \u00a7 1-210)\r\n\r\nRequires timely, transparent responses and prohibits unnecessary delays.\r\nADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.) and Section 504 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794)\r\n\r\nMandate reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, ensuring equitable access to public records.\r\nFirst Amendment\r\n\r\nProtects the right to petition the government for redress of grievances, including access to information.\r\nFourteenth Amendment\r\n\r\nGuarantees equal protection under the law, which includes equal access to public services for individuals with disabilities.\r\nFifth Amendment\r\n\r\nEnsures due process rights, which are infringed by delayed or inaccessible responses.\r\nConsequences of Continued Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with statutory and constitutional obligations will result in the following:\r\n\r\nAdministrative Complaints\r\n\r\nComplaints will be filed with the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, and the Office for Civil Rights.\r\nJudicial Action\r\n\r\nLegal remedies will be pursued under FOIA, ADA, and constitutional protections to enforce compliance.\r\nPublic Reporting\r\n\r\nNon-compliance will be reported to media outlets, advocacy organizations, and oversight committees to ensure public accountability.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis appeal is an opportunity for your office to rectify systemic failures and demonstrate a commitment to transparency, accountability, and accessibility. I expect a full response and compliance with the relief sought by December 17, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n39 Kings HWY STE C\r\nGales Ferry, CT 06335 \r\nDB.42.131.Inf.\r\nABI Resources https://www.ctbraininjury.com/blog/tags/db-42-131-inf https://x.com/ABIresources/status/1866212331279339765 https://www.youtube.com/@ABI.RESOURCES-CT-ABI-MFP-CARE/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=2\r\n\r\nCC:\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission\r\nU.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division\r\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services\r\nRelevant Congressional Oversight Committees",

        "communication": "Subject: Final Assertion of Legal Obligations Under FOIA, ADA, and Constitutional Law\r\nSubject: 10/17/2024 Connecticut Freedom of Information Act Request: Subject: Comprehensive FOIA Request for Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Waiver Program Records (Office Of Policy And Management)\r\n\r\n01.08.2025\r\n\r\nTo all It May Concern in All Relevant Departments and Divisions,\r\n\r\nOffice Of Policy And Management\r\nOffice of Legal Affairs Office of Policy and Management\r\n450 Capitol Avenue MS# 55 SEC Hartford, CT 06106-1379 OPM.FOI@ct.gov\r\n\r\nThis correspondence pertains to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\n\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\nRequired Action:\r\n\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\n\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\n\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions. Your actions will either affirm your agency\u2019s commitment to accountability or further evidence systemic disregard for these principles.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt and substantive response.\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nState of Connecticut Officials:\r\n\r\nGovernor Ned Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: State Capitol, 210 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nToll-Free: (800) 406-1527\r\nTDD: (860) 524-7397\r\nEmail: Contact Form\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/governor\r\n\r\nAttorney General William Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/ag\r\n\r\nCommissioner Andrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nOffice Address: 55 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, CT 06105\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/dss\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Suite 1100, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nToll-Free: 1-866-374-3617\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/foi\r\n\r\nFederal Officials and Agencies:\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Blumenthal\r\nTitle: U.S. Senator from Connecticut\r\nWashington D.C.

Accommodations Request\r\nThis request includes explicit ADA accommodations to address cognitive processing challenges resulting from my traumatic brain injury (TBI). These accommodations are legally required under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nRequested ADA Accommodations\r\nTo ensure accessibility and compliance with ADA standards (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I request the following accommodations for all communications and records:\r\n\r\nScreen-Reader Compatible Formats\r\n\r\nAll documents must be provided in properly labeled PDFs or plain-text files.\r\nEnsure that the documents are screen-reader compatible and retain clear, accessible formatting.\r\nExclusive MuckRock Platform Communication\r\n\r\nAll communications must occur exclusively via the MuckRock platform.\r\nDo not send external links, emails, portals, passwords, codes, or require phone calls for access.\r\nText Embedded in Email Bodies\r\n\r\nKey information must be embedded directly in the email body to facilitate comprehension and accessibility.\r\nSimplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide plain-language summaries for complex or legal documents to ensure clarity and understanding.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Officers\r\n\r\nInclude the full name, title, and contact information of all responsible officers handling this request.\r\nNon-Negotiable Compliance\r\n\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and are essential for ensuring equal access to information. Failure to provide the requested accommodations may constitute a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Thank you for ensuring compliance and accessibility in addressing this request.\r\n\r\nThe challenges we face today demand more than acknowledgment\u2014they require action, collaboration, and a unified commitment to solutions. Together, we must embrace transparency, accountability, and compassion as the foundation of our efforts. By fostering open communication, prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable, and holding systems accountable, we can rebuild trust and ensure equitable outcomes for all.\r\n\r\nSolutions lie in unity\u2014when state and federal leaders, advocates, and communities work hand in hand to uphold justice and fairness. Transparency through accessible Freedom of Information processes, adherence to legal mandates, and robust oversight are the pillars that support meaningful change. Each of us has a role to play in creating a system that serves and protects.\r\n\r\nOur collective mission is clear: to build bridges between agencies and communities, ensure the dignity of every individual, and honor the principles that guide us toward progress.

The documents provided fail to satisfy the scope of my request and do not comply with state and federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) obligations, as well as statutory ADA accommodation requirements.\r\n\r\nGrounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Provide Complete Records\r\nThe records provided are insufficient and omit critical components of the request, including:\r\n\r\nLegislative Records: Bills, amendments, resolutions, legislative history, and voting records on the ABI Waiver Program were not included.\r\n\r\nPublic Records: Missing comprehensive financial records, including budget allocations, financial statements, and audits, required for program transparency.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence: Internal and external communications, including emails and directives related to the program, were not provided.\r\n\r\nPersonnel Records: Non-confidential employment records and organizational charts related to program administration were excluded.\r\n\r\nProgram Information: Enrollment data, performance metrics, and compliance reviews were not included.\r\n\r\n2. Failure to Provide Justifications for Redactions or Denials\r\nThe response lacks a Vaughn Index or detailed justifications for any omissions or redactions, as required by FOIA statutes (Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210 and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)).\r\n\r\n3. ADA Accommodations Request\r\nThis request includes explicit ADA accommodations to address cognitive processing challenges resulting from my traumatic brain injury (TBI). These accommodations are legally required under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nRequested ADA Accommodations\r\nTo ensure accessibility and compliance with ADA standards (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I request the following accommodations for all communications and records:\r\n\r\nScreen-Reader Compatible Formats\r\n\r\nAll documents must be provided in properly labeled PDFs or plain-text files.\r\nEnsure that the documents are screen-reader compatible and retain clear, accessible formatting.\r\n\r\nExclusive MuckRock Platform Communication\r\nAll communications must occur exclusively via the MuckRock platform.\r\nDo not send external links, emails, portals, passwords, codes, or require phone calls for access.\r\nText Embedded in Bodies\r\n\r\nKey information must be embedded directly in the  body to facilitate comprehension and accessibility.\r\nSimplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide plain-language summaries for complex or legal documents to ensure clarity and understanding.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Officers\r\n\r\n***** Include the full name, title, and contact information of all responsible officers handling this request. ****\r\n\r\nNon-Negotiable Compliance\r\n\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and are essential for ensuring equal access to information. Failure to provide the requested accommodations may constitute a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Thank you for ensuring compliance and accessibility in addressing this request.\r\n\r\nRelief Requested\r\nTo address the above deficiencies, I formally request the following actions:\r\n\r\n1. Complete Records Production\r\nProvide all requested records, including:\r\n\r\nLegislative history, voting records, and meeting minutes related to the ABI Waiver Program.\r\nComprehensive public records, including budget allocations, audits, and financial data.\r\nCorrespondence between the Department of Social Services (DSS), OPM, and external entities related to the program.\r\nPersonnel records, job descriptions, and organizational charts for staff overseeing the program.\r\nProgram information such as enrollment data, compliance reviews, and outcome reports.\r\n\r\n2. Detailed Justifications for Redactions or Denials\r\nSubmit a Vaughn Index or equivalent documentation detailing statutory exemptions for withheld or redacted records.\r\n\r\n3. ADA Compliance\r\nImmediately comply with ADA accommodations, including:\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Request\r\nThis request includes explicit ADA accommodations to address cognitive processing challenges resulting from my traumatic brain injury (TBI). These accommodations are legally required under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nRequested ADA Accommodations\r\nTo ensure accessibility and compliance with ADA standards (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I request the following accommodations for all communications and records:\r\n\r\nScreen-Reader Compatible Formats\r\n\r\nAll documents must be provided in properly labeled PDFs or plain-text files.\r\nEnsure that the documents are screen-reader compatible and retain clear, accessible formatting.\r\nExclusive MuckRock Platform Communication\r\n\r\nAll communications must occur exclusively via the MuckRock platform.\r\nDo not send external links, emails, portals, passwords, codes, or require phone calls for access.\r\nText Embedded in Email Bodies\r\n\r\nKey information must be embedded directly in the email body to facilitate comprehension and accessibility.\r\nSimplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide plain-language summaries for complex or legal documents to ensure clarity and understanding.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Officers\r\n\r\nInclude the full name, title, and contact information of all responsible officers handling this request.\r\n\r\nNon-Negotiable Compliance\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and are essential for ensuring equal access to information. Failure to provide the requested accommodations may constitute a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Thank you for ensuring compliance and accessibility in addressing this request.\r\n\r\n4. Timeline for Completion\r\nProvide a clear timeline for fulfilling this appeal and any pending records requests.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis\r\nFOIA Compliance (Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nThe FOIA mandates timely, complete responses to public records requests. Any delays or incomplete responses must be accompanied by statutory justifications.\r\n\r\nADA Compliance (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794)\r\nPublic entities are required to provide reasonable accommodations to ensure equitable access to information for individuals with disabilities.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Protections\r\nFailure to comply with FOIA and ADA violates:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Right to petition the government for redress of grievances.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: Equal protection under the law.\r\nFifth Amendment: Due process rights.\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to resolve this matter will result in escalation through the following avenues:\r\n\r\nAdministrative Complaints: Filing with the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission and the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division.\r\nJudicial Remedies: Pursuing litigation to compel compliance with FOIA and ADA obligations.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging transparency organizations and media outlets to highlight systemic non-compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis appeal serves as an opportunity for OPM to correct these deficiencies and demonstrate a commitment to transparency, accountability, and accessibility. I expect a response within ten (10) business days outlining your corrective actions.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nOriginal FOIA Requests (OPM ID #24-81 and #24-84)\r\nDocuments Provided by OPM\r\nCC:\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission\r\nU.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division\r\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS)",

These failures directly impact whistleblower protections, Medicaid oversight, and public accountability.\r\n\r\nIssues to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Case Numbers and Records Management\r\n\r\nCase Numbers Requiring Investigation:\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121\r\n\r\n2. Anonymity and Lack of Accountability in Decision-Making\r\n\r\nUnsigned Determination Letters:\r\n\r\nMany determination letters from OSC lack identifiable signatures, names, or clear authorship.\r\n\r\nThis practice raises serious concerns about accountability and compliance with transparency laws.\r\n\r\n3. Suppressed or Altered Records\r\n\r\nEvidence suggests discrepancies between the whistleblower reports I submitted and how they were recorded or handled by OSC.\r\n\r\nSpecific issues include:\r\n\r\nAlterations or removal of content from submitted complaints.\r\n\r\nSuppression of reports that exposed systemic failures in Medicaid oversight and retaliation against whistleblowers.\r\n\r\n4. Lack of FOIA Compliance\r\n\r\nDespite repeated Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, OSC and related agencies have failed to provide:\r\n\r\nComplete case files and communication logs.\r\n\r\nJustification for withheld or redacted information.\r\n\r\nClear timelines for compliance.\r\n\r\nSpecific Questions to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Who is Responsible for Managing These Records?\r\n\r\nIdentify the individuals, teams, or automated systems involved in creating, altering, and assigning these case numbers and reports.\r\n\r\n2. What Decisions Were Made and Why?\r\n\r\nDetermine how decisions were reached, why some reports were closed without action, and why letters were sent anonymously.\r\n\r\n3. Were There Violations of Federal Law?\r\n\r\nInvestigate potential obstruction of justice, retaliation, or misuse of authority under whistleblower protection laws and FOIA.\r\n\r\nKey Agencies and Officials Involved\r\n\r\nThis matter spans multiple federal and state agencies, including:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Department of Justice (DOJ)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Office of Inspector General (OIG)\r\n\r\nWhy This Matters\r\n\r\n1. Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nRetaliation against whistleblowers and suppression of reports undermine federal protections designed to safeguard transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\n2. Impact on Vulnerable Populations:\r\n\r\nThese failures harm Medicaid consumers, particularly those with disabilities, by allowing systemic mismanagement to persist unchecked.\r\n\r\n3. Misuse of Taxpayer Funds:\r\n\r\nLack of oversight and accountability results in waste and misuse of federal funds meant to serve the public.\r\n\r\nRequested Actions\r\n\r\n1. Investigate Record Management:\r\n\r\nAudit all OSC records, emails, and internal communications related to these case numbers.\r\n\r\nIdentify responsible individuals or systems.\r\n\r\n2. Subpoena Additional Evidence:\r\n\r\nSecure all suppressed or altered reports to ensure a complete and accurate investigation.\r\n\r\n3. Hold Accountable Those Involved in Misconduct:\r\n\r\nRecommend prosecution or disciplinary action for any individuals found to have violated federal laws.\r\n\r\n4. Ensure Compliance with FOIA and Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nMandate OSC and related agencies to comply fully with FOIA requests and whistleblower laws.\r\n\r\nAttachments\r\n\r\nI have attached all available documentation, including:\r\n\r\nCorrespondence with OSC, including determination letters and emails.\r\n\r\nFOIA requests and responses (or lack thereof).\r\n\r\nDetailed reports submitted to OSC and other federal agencies.\r\n\r\nThis issue demands immediate attention to uphold the principles of transparency, accountability, and justice. I am available to provide additional information or documentation as needed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\n_______\r\nSubject: Final Assertion of Legal Obligations Under FOIA, ADA, and Constitutional Law\r\n\r\nSubject: 12/23/2024 Freedom of Information Act Request: OSC Cases DI-25-000310, DI-25-000325, DI-25-000379, DI-12192024714, and DI-12112024134; Associated FBI, DOJ, HHS, CMS, OAG, OIP , DOT and Medicaid Oversight Records FOIA (Federal Bureau of Investigation)\r\n01.08.2025\r\n\r\nTo all It May Concern in All Relevant Departments and Divisions,\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n\r\nMichael G. Seidel\r\nSection Chief\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nThis correspondence pertains to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nOSC Case Records\r\n\r\nComplete files, internal and external communications, investigations, and resolutions regarding:\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSC File No. DI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\n\r\nRequired Action:\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions. Your actions will either affirm your agency\u2019s commitment to accountability or further evidence systemic disregard for these principles.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt and substantive response.\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nState of Connecticut Officials:\r\n\r\nGovernor Ned Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: State Capitol, 210 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nToll-Free: (800) 406-1527\r\nTDD: (860) 524-7397\r\nEmail: Contact Form\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/governor\r\n\r\nAttorney General William Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/ag\r\n\r\nCommissioner Andrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nOffice Address: 55 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, CT 06105\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/dss\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Suite 1100, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nToll-Free: 1-866-374-3617\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/foi\r\n\r\nFederal Officials and Agencies:\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Blumenthal\r\nTitle: U.S. Senator from Connecticut\r\nWashington D.C.

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

The office will provide an estimate of the time required to respond to the request, and may provide an estimate of copying costs pursuant to a specific request seeking an estimate of cost. If the requestor believes the amount of time or estimated costs stated are not reasonable, the requestor may petition the public records officer for a formal review under WAC 44-06-120.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.",

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

We are not sure what you meant by \"realted\". Did you mean \"related\"? Please know the term \"related\" is inexact and often requires clarification. The Washington State's Attorney General\u2019s Public Records Act Model Rules suggest that the agency should seek clarification from the requestor. The Model Rules also provide that the agency may interpret the request to be for records which directly and fairly discuss the topic. \r\n  \r\n As you may understand, the interpretation of what a record \u201crelating\" to a subject can vary from person to person. To ensure the search is both accurate and efficient, we seek to clarify your request. At this time, we interpret this portion of your request as seeking copies of payments made by requestors to obtain the responsive records released as response to their public record request(s) made in the 2024 calendar year. It is currently unknown if payments were made in the 2024 calendar year for public record requests regardless of what year the request was made and we will search for and provide those too, should they exist. If any of this interpretation is not accurate, please let us know within 30 days. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Your request to know the total feeTotal fees will be ascertained once all the responsive records have been compiled for this request. At this stage, we have gathered records together that will require a fee of $3.50 to be paid. Once the installment has been reviewed and redactions applied, we will then inform you what the fee will be for the records. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Washington State Public Records Act RCW 42.56, and more specifically RCW 42.56.520 recognizes that additional time to respond to a request is allowed when needed to clarify the intent of the request, to determine if any of the information requested is exempt, to notify third parties affected by the request, or to locate and assemble the information requested. The District anticipates being able to release records responsive to your public record request on or before February 5, 2025. If we are able to provide the records to you sooner, we will do so. If you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request please let us know. \r\n  \n Sincerely, \r\n  \r\n Spokane Public Schools\r\n200 N. Bernard\r\nSpokane, Washington 99201",

The charge for the records is $3.75. The records may be paid for at the cashier\u2019s desk on the second floor of the Administration building. Or, if you prefer, you may make a check or money order payable to Spokane Public Schools in the amount of $3.75. Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested records will be made available to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201 Attn: Public Records Office. \r\n  \r\n Please note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency\u2019s notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records. \r\n  \r\n Please also note that some records have been redated with a black text block that include white writing of an exemption key code (01-24) over the protected word or words. You will see the Redaction Exemption Key added to the last page of each record that was redacted. You will know which record has been redacted as the word \"Redacted\" has been added to the end of the title of the released record. Student names and identifying information is protected from release and has been redacted under 20 USC Sect. 1232g; RCW 42.56.230(2)(a)(iii). RCW 42.56.230(5) Credit card numbers and bank account numbers are exempt from disclosure and have been redacted from these records. \r\n  \r\n The District has provided copies of legal invoices, purchase orders of technology and supplies used for public record requests, and amount that requestors paid for their public record requests, also provided salary and benefits of staff that work on public record requests. This concludes the District\u2019s response to this request as the District considers this request to be fulfilled and closed. The Public Records Act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of the District\u2019s response and records produced has started to run because the District does not intend to further address this request. The one year statute of limitations means you have one year to challenge the District\u2019s response and responsive records released to you. \r\n  \r\n If you have follow up questions about this request, please ask within the next 30 days. Please let us know if you believe additional responsive records have not been provided or if we have misunderstood or misinterpreted your request. If you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request please also let us know. \r\n  \n Sincerely, \r\n  \r\n Spokane Public Schools\r\n200 N. Bernard\r\nSpokane, Washington 99201",
