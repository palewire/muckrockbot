S1 Deaths In ICE Custody Emails Meta-Data (or, alternatively, the Emails themselves)\r\nA metadata list of all emails sent or received by DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas since February 2021, containing one or more of the following words or phrases: \r\n(1) \u201cDeath in custody\u201d; (2) \u201cIn-Custody Death\u201d; (3) \u201cDetainee Death\u201d; (4) \u201cInmate Death\u201d; (5) \u201cprisoner death\u201d or (6) \u201cICE Directive 11003.5\u201d. \r\nPlease provide metadata showing: date sent, sender, attachments, file size, recipients (CC & BCC), and subject line.\r\nIf the agency\u2019s position is that the existing meta-data necessary to provide this list is not a pre-existing agency record, we will instead accept each and every non-duplicative responsive email.\r\n\r\nPart B. S1 ICE Custody Death Calendar Entries \r\nA list of all calendar entries for Sec. Mayorkas since February 2022 reflecting any meeting  the Secretary or a DHS designee was invited to or attended about ICE in-custody deaths, as reflected by the time of the meeting or any text accompanying the calendar invite. \r\n\r\nPart C. S1 Names of the 9 In-Custody Deaths on His Watch Meta-Data (or, alternatively, the Emails themselves)\r\nAll emails sent or received by DHS Secretary Mayorkas since February 2, 2021, referencing any of the following 9 individuals who have passed away in or shortly after being released from ICE custody since the Secretary\u2019s confirmation: \r\n\r\n(1) Jesse Jermone Dean Jr.\tThe Bahamas\t3/21/1962\t2/5/2021\t58\tCalhoun County Jail\r\nBattle Creek, Michigan (Calhoun Co. Michigan) \r\n\r\n(2) Diego Fernando Gallego-Agudelo\tColombia\t\t3/15/2021\t45\tPort Isabel Detention Center, Los Fresnos, TX (Ahtna)\r\n\r\n(3) Elba Maria Centeno Briones\tNicaragua\t3/23/84\t8/3/2021\t37\tEl Valle Valley Detention Facility, Harlingen, TX (MTC) \r\n\r\n(4) Pablo Sanchez-Gotopo\tVenezuela \t6/3/1981\t10/1/2021\t40\tAdams County Detention Center, Natchez, Mississippi (CoreCivic) \r\n\r\n(5) Benjamin Gonzalez-Soto\tMexico\t11/24/1985\t7/8/2022\t36\tFlorence SPC, & Central AZ Correctional Complex, Florence, Arizona (CoreCivic) \r\n\r\n(6) Kesley Vial\tBrazil\t8/29/98\t8/24/2022\t23\tTorrance County Detention Center, Estancia, New Mexico (CoreCivic) \r\n\r\n(7) Melvin Calero\tNicaragua\t9/29/83\t10/13/2022\t39\tAurora ICE Processing Center, Denver, Colorado (GEO) \r\n\r\n(8) Cristian Dimitriscu\tRomania\t\t3/7/2023\t\t\tOtay Mesa Detention Center, Otay Mesa, California (CoreCivic) \r\n\r\n(9) Salvador Vargas\tMexico\t\t4/4/2023\t61 Stewart Detention Center, Lumpkin, Georgia (CoreCivic) \r\n\r\nThere appear to be no meaningful consequences for a federal contractor that allows a preventable death in ICE custody. Retraining, a contract penalty amounting to just 20% of a single month\u2019s invoice, or multiple contract penalties amounting to only $700k for two deaths, are the only measurable penalties ICE has publicly admitted to levying against contractors whose violation of their contracts take lives. ICE does not announce these penalties, or the findings supporting them, publicly. Perhaps they do not even share them with the Secretary of Homeland Security. We\u2019d like to know if he\u2019s asked. \r\n\r\nSecretary Mayorkas committed on camera to operating ICE detention facilities in a safe and humane manner. To this end, he has also committed to reviewing performance of facilities and cancelling contracts that fail to ensure humans are safe and cared for in accordance with federal requirements. Yet the facilities listed above, which are sites of repeat findings of violations, and repeat deaths, are all\r\n\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), we hereby request expedited processing of this request, and certify under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct to the best of our knowledge and understanding: \r\nDeaths in ICE custody have been the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest both historically and today. The very first in-custody ICE death listed above was found by DHS-OIG to have been preventable, and the result of medical neglect by ICE-contracted facility staff. See, https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-02/OIG-23-12-Feb23.pdf (\u201cOur contracted medical team reviewed the other four deaths in ICE detention in FY 2021 and found one individual was not provided timely or appropriate care by medical staff at the Calhoun County Jail in Battle Creek, Michigan.\u201d). Despite the OIG\u2019s findings that Calhoun County and its medical contractor, the now-bankrupt Corizon (see https://www.alreporter.com/2023/02/17/corizon-prison-healthcare-provider-declares-bankruptcy-yescare-apparently-replaces-ceo/), failed to render timely or appropriate medical care to Jessie Dean before his death, ICE continues to contract with the County for the imprisonment of non-citizens, further endangering the lives of people locked inside. \r\n\r\nAs ICE is about to rapidly expand its average daily population with the end of Title 42, our community is deeply concerned that DHS is unprepared to care for those it locks up. Expedited access to these records will help dispel or confirm these concerns, and position our network to take the appropriate actions necessary to prevent preventable deaths where the government refuses to do so. \r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act Officer\r\nTransportation Security Administration\r\n601 South 12th Street\r\nArlington, VA 20598\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing to submit a limited Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking records related to two areas of interest within the Transportation Security Administration (TSA): personnel records of TSA employees and records related to the TSA's use of body scanners and other advanced imaging technologies for the period of the last two years (2021-2023).\r\n\r\nFirstly, I request any and all training programs and materials provided to TSA agents in the last two years, including any materials related to cultural competency or implicit bias training. Additionally, I would like to obtain any disciplinary actions taken against TSA agents, including any records related to employee misconduct, violations of TSA policies and procedures, or complaints filed against TSA agents. Lastly, I request internal investigations of TSA employees in the last two years, including any records related to allegations of abuse, harassment, or discrimination by TSA agents.\r\n\r\nThese records will help to provide transparency and accountability for the TSA's actions in maintaining high standards of conduct among its personnel. In support of this request, I would like to cite several court cases, including EPIC v. DHS, 615 F.3d 519 (D.C. Cir. 2010), where the court held that the TSA must release documents related to the effectiveness and privacy impact of body scanners used at airports. The court found that the public interest in transparency and accountability outweighed any privacy concerns related to the release of these records. Additionally, in NARA v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), the Supreme Court held that FOIA requires the disclosure of records that could reasonably be interpreted as indicating an agency's ability or willingness to protect the privacy of individuals.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I request any training materials and manuals provided to TSA agents on the use of body scanners and other advanced imaging technologies in the last two years. Furthermore, I request technical specifications for the scanners and technologies used by TSA agents. Additionally, I would like to obtain any reports or studies conducted by the TSA or other organizations related to the effectiveness and safety of these technologies in the last two years. Lastly, I request any records related to complaints or incidents related to the use of these technologies in the last two years, including any reports of malfunctions, false positives, or privacy concerns.\r\n\r\nThese records will help to ensure the effective and safe use of advanced imaging technologies and provide insights into any privacy concerns associated with their use. In support of this request, I would like to cite the case of Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), where the court held that the Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures and that a warrant is required to conduct a search, absent some exception.\r\n\r\nFOIA requires agencies to disclose records unless they are exempt from disclosure under one of nine exemptions listed in the statute. If you determine that any of the requested records are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide a written explanation of the exemption and the specific reasons why it applies.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Specifically, I request the following:\r\n\r\nAll reports, analyses, and briefings that discuss or analyze the use of quantum computing by the NSA or its contractors for intelligence, encryption, or other purposes.\r\n\r\nAll contracts, grants, and other agreements between the NSA and any other entities, including private companies and academic institutions, related to research or development of quantum computing technology.\r\n\r\nAll correspondence, including emails, memos, and letters, related to the NSA's use or research of quantum computing technology.\r\n\r\nAll budget documents and spending reports related to the NSA's activities and expenditures related to quantum computing.\r\n\r\nAll policies and guidelines related to the NSA's use or research of quantum computing technology, including any regulations or laws governing the use of such technology.\r\n\r\nThe time frame for this request is the last five years, from January 1, 2018, to the date this request is processed.\r\n\r\nI ask that you conduct a search for all responsive records in a manner that is reasonably calculated to locate all records within the scope of this request. Please do not construe my use of the word \"any\" to be an attempt to limit the scope of this request. Rather, I intend it to be inclusive of all records within the specified time frame that are responsive to this request.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I am requesting that you provide me with a list of all databases, systems, or other records repositories that were searched, and provide an explanation of the search methods used to identify and locate the records responsive to my request.\r\n\r\nPlease note that a Glomar response, neither confirming nor denying the existence of records, is not appropriate in this case, as there is already public information indicating that the NSA has been involved in quantum computing research and development. See, e.g., \"NSA Research Directorate's Quantum Program,\" GovernmentCIO Magazine (Feb. 20, 2018).\r\n\r\nIf any part of my request is denied, please provide a detailed explanation for the denial and cite the specific statutory exemption(s) relied upon. In addition, I request that you provide me with any segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe ICE Detainee Death Report regarding Salvador Vargas, 61, who ICE says died April 7, 2023, after being imprisoned at CoreCivic\u2019s Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, which has housed 10 people for ICE who have died in the past 6 years. https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/noncitizen-ice-custody-passes-away-georgia-hospital\r\n\r\nWe make this request as a demand for affirmative disclosure under 5 USC 552(a)(2)(D), as well as under 5 USC 552(a)(3) as a demand for prompt access to information. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request \r\nWe make this request for expedited processing pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), and provide the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\nICE is under a mandatory obligation, set forth in congressional appropriations language, to post the Death Death Report within 30 days of Mr. Vargas\u2019s death. Detainee deaths have been the subject of widespread media attention culminating in congressional action, including the mandatory reporting requirements ICE itself describes. https://www.ice.gov/detain/detainee-death-reporting. ICE is currently violating that law by allotting itself 90 days instead of 30. The purpose of the Death Report publication requirement is to ensure Congress and the public have information about deaths in custody. Access to timely, complete, and accurate information allows the public to take protective actions and advocate policies that could reduce these deaths. For instance, public outcry over in-custody deaths resulted in Congress ordering the DHS Office of Inspector General to conduct an annual review of ICE and CBP in-custody deaths to determine if any systemic issues contributed to those tragedies and make recommendations about how to address those issues. See https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-02/OIG-23-12-Feb23.pdf. \r\n\r\nAs of the date of this request - May 11, 2023 - ICE is in violation of the 30-day Death Report publication requirement. This means the ICE detention system is violating the Anti-Deficiency Act, and ICE leaders are potentially subject to civil and criminal penalties. \r\n\r\nPlease grant this request expedited processing and bring ICE into compliance by posting the detainee death report for Mr. Vargas on ICE\u2019s FOIA reading room, or supplying it to the #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative so that we may post it publicly. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

certify under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct to the best of our knowledge and understanding: \r\nThe subject of the records at issue - ICE deaths in custody - has been the subject of substantial and widespread media coverage about which there exist significant questions as to the agency\u2019s conduct. Multiple federal courts have held ICE broke the law by failing to timely respond to requests about in-custody deaths, including the courts in Transgender Law Center v. ICE (NDCal/CA9), Innovation Law Lab v. ICE (DNM), and Owen v. ICE (CD Cal). As the folks in charge of IHSC, Smith and Rivera are the IHSC officials with the most (a) institutional knowledge about deaths in ICE custody born of long-term, mandatory reports made to or by them about deaths in custody; and (b) individual responsibility in his respective roles within the agency for preventing preventable deaths. Archiving these officials\u2019 emails for historians and experts to understand their response to 58 deaths in custody, and making these records available to those opposing expansion of the carceral apparatus by ICE in the present moment are essential to preventing another 58 losses of human life in ICE custody in the years to come. \r\n\r\nPattern and Practice Injunction Advisal \r\nIn August 2021, our project wrote ICE\u2019s FOIA leaders a letter calling attention to an extensive pattern and practice of failing to timely acknowledge FOIA requests, process them for determinations within statutory timeframes, and make records promptly available. We received no response. In January 2023, the US District Court for the Central District of California declared ICE has an unlawful pattern and practice of failing to timely respond to FOIA requests, and entered judgment in favor of families from whom ICE withheld records about deaths in custody for years. We know you are unlikely to acknowledge this request, assign it an individualized tracking number, make a timely determination about whether to grant or deny it, and make these records available promptly, and on an expedited basis. You are unlikely to have read this far until this request is attached to a federal lawsuit. But if that is the necessary means to enforce this request, we respectfully advise you that the Court in Owen v. ICE (CD Cal) has already said \u201cIt should not take a lawsuit for an agency to comply with FOIA.\u201d If the agency, after having judgment entered against it for FOIA noncompliance in a lawsuit that should never have been necessary in the first place, cannot bring itself into compliance with FOIA\u2019s timelines, we will invite the Court to do so through an injunction. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response,  \r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), we hereby request expedited processing of this request, and certify under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct to the best of our knowledge and understanding: \r\nThe subject of the records at issue - ICE deaths in custody - has been the subject of substantial and widespread media coverage about which there exist significant questions as to the agency\u2019s conduct. Multiple federal courts have held ICE broke the law by failing to timely respond to requests about in-custody deaths, including the courts in Transgender Law Center v. ICE (NDCal/CA9), Innovation Law Lab v. ICE (DNM), and Owen v. ICE (CD Cal). As the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Acting Director, the prior head of ICE\u2019s Custody Management Division, and the agency\u2019s Acting Director during both the Trump and Biden Administrations, Tae Johnson is the single official with the most (a) institutional knowledge about deaths in ICE custody born of long-term, mandatory reports made to or by him about deaths in custody; and (b) individual responsibility in his respective roles within the agency for preventing preventable deaths. Archiving Johnon\u2019s emails for historians and experts to understand his response to 58 deaths in custody, and making these records available to those opposing expansion of the carceral apparatus by ICE in the present moment are essential to preventing another 58 losses of human life in ICE custody in the years to come. \r\n\r\nPattern and Practice Injunction Advisal \r\nIn August 2021, our project wrote ICE\u2019s FOIA leaders a letter calling attention to an extensive pattern and practice of failing to timely acknowledge FOIA requests, process them for determinations within statutory timeframes, and make records promptly available. We received no response. In January 2023, the US District Court for the Central District of California declared ICE has an unlawful pattern and practice of failing to timely respond to FOIA requests, and entered judgment in favor of families from whom ICE withheld records about deaths in custody for years. We know you are unlikely to acknowledge this request, assign it an individualized tracking number, make a timely determination about whether to grant or deny it, and make these records available promptly, and on an expedited basis. You are unlikely to have read this far until this request is attached to a federal lawsuit. But if that is the necessary means to enforce this request, we respectfully advise you that the Court in Owen v. ICE (CD Cal) has already said \u201cIt should not take a lawsuit for an agency to comply with FOIA.\u201d If the agency, after having judgment entered against it for FOIA noncompliance in a lawsuit that should never have been necessary in the first place, cannot bring itself into compliance with FOIA\u2019s timelines, we will invite the Court to do so through an injunction. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response,  \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",
