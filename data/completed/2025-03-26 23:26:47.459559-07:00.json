Your request was received in this office on 2/22/2023.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.If you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Fernando Pineiro Jr. at the address above or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

The records you seek require a search in at least one other office within ATF, and so your request presents \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d under the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii)(I).  Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.  We have not completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.  The time needed to process your request will depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located. For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:  simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track.  Your request has been placed in chronological order based on the date of receipt and will be handled as quickly as possible when it is assigned for processing.  A tracking number has been assigned to your request and is set forth above.  Please refer to this number in any future communications regarding this request.Because this Office is not assessing any fees in connection with the processing of your request, there is no need for us to determine whether your request qualifies for a waiver of fees.If you have any questions regarding the status of your request, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at 202-648-7390 to discuss any aspect of your request.

This significant demand has caused a backlog of FOIA requests, and is considered an \u201cunusual circumstance.\u201d  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).  Because of these unusual circumstances, we need to extend the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by statute. \r\n\r\nDue to this backlog, we estimate that it will take 90 days from the date of this letter to respond to your request.  Please note this is only an estimated date of completion as there may be circumstances that lead to a longer or shorter processing time.  The time needed to complete our processing of your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.  In any event, we will follow up with you if we are able to locate potentially responsive documents from the appropriate ATF component.  To allow us to respond more quickly to you, you may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing. \r\n\r\nI regret the necessity of this delay, but I assure you that your request will be processed as soon as possible.  If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390, for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.

Please refer to this number in any future correspondence. \r\n\r\nIn response to your request, we are releasing a total of 30 pages of responsive material.  Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld.  Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \r\n\r\nPursuant to exemption (b)(6), 0 pages have been withheld in full and 3 pages in part. We are withholding third party information, including the names of ATF employees, under FOIA Exemption (b)(6).  To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the persons whose information you requested.  Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.  The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). \r\n\r\nPursuant to exemption (b)(6), (b)(7)(C), 0 pages have been withheld in full and 27 pages in part.  We are withholding third party information, including the names of ATF employees.  To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the persons whose information you requested.  Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.  The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6).  Also, we are withholding third party information, including the names of ATF employees as well as personal information of other persons mentioned in the records, pursuant to Exemption (b)(7)(C) of the FOIA. Exemption (b)(7)(C) permits the withholding of information compiled for law enforcement purposes that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d The public interest in disclosure is limited to the FOIA\u2019s core purpose of shedding light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties. The public interest under Exemption (b)(7)(C) must be both significant and compelling in order to overcome the legitimate personal privacy interests of a third party. In this matter, the disclosure would not serve the core purpose of the FOIA but would serve as an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390 for  any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.

With that said, a large amount of emails sent from Jamez Holzer to our DHS FOIA staff pertain his guidance, input, comments, etc, regarding the admin work of such cases (ex: \"this covid case requires white house consult\"). I believe this is not what you're looking for. I construed that what you're looking for are general guidance to the FOIA staff regarding COVID-19 and instructions for the FOIA Office to adjust to it?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is correct.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions and would like to further discuss your request, please don't hesitate in letting me know.\r\n\r\nMy phone number is 703-362-7078.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJennifer A.

Specifically, I am requesting a list of all people currently or formerly incarcerated for a drug-free zone violation from 2015 to the date that this request is processed. The list should include names, date of conviction, date of end of sentence, offenses convicted of, inmate ID, facility type (ie. state prison, local jail) and parole eligibility date.I would also like to request any demographic information that may be readily available for the above persons, such as, but not limited to, each person\u2019s date of birth, age at arrest, current age, race, ethnicity and gender. If this time frame is overly burdensome, please provide a date range that can be fulfilled.\nIn addition, I am requesting a copy of any and all reports or studies generated by the state that discuss the passage and efficacy of the drug free zone law.\nIf there are any fees for obtaining or copying these records, please inform me should the cost exceed $100. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees as I am requesting the information on behalf of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of drug free zone laws. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\nIf possible, please provide the requested documents electronically in Excel format. However, if this is not feasible, please inform me of the available methods for obtaining these records. Further, if you expect a significant delay in responding to this request, please contact me with information concerning when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption that justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\nJenny Wadhwa",

This is only for the objective criteria approved by the BOV, with when and how it was approved, that established those performance criteria upon which evaluations, bonuses, etc. were acted on.\r\n\r\nI am willing to take incremental fulfillment of this FOIA so, for example,s the expectations and goals the Superintendent was evaluated on in the recent BOV Special Meeting where the BOV voted not to extend his contract should be available immediately.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nBackground on the CBP One\r\nMost asylum-seekers who come to the U.S. border through Mexico are expelled under the Title 42 Order initiated during the prior administration and continued by the Biden administration. More than 2 million such expulsions have occurred in roughly two years\u2014many of whom are bona fide asylum-seekers who fear serious harm, persecution, and torture in Mexico. Some of the expelled are removed to their origin state by Mexican immigration officials. Others perish in Mexico, or re-attempting the dangerous entry into the U.S. in order to avoid that fate. \r\n\r\nFor some \u2014 roughly 700 per day as an aggregate number encompassing all Southern CBP Ports of Entry \u2014 the U.S. government allows exemption from Title 42 and entry into the U.S., notwithstanding that order. \r\n\r\nA U.S. government-required app called \u201cCBP-One\u201d serves as the hub for making exemption requests. Here is the CBP One Privacy Impact Assessment: https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhscbppia-068-cbp-one-mobile-application \r\n\r\nThrough CBP-One, civil society organizations and Mexican immigration officials (INM) are afforded a dedicated number of exemptions. These parties then identify qualified exemption-seekers and inform CBP that they wish to cross under a Title 42 exemption. Exporting data from the CBP-One app, CBP then sends spreadsheets to INM indicating who will be allowed to present at a POE and claim a Title 42 exemption. Because the exemption process is among the only lawful paths to protection for people fleeing violence, access to exemption numbers from CBP, and the corresponding requirement to use CBP One to claim these exemptions by information CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations (OFO) who\u2019s on the list, has become a coveted, and thus, a commodity. The organizations CBP has unilaterally chosen have monetized access to CBP One, charging rates varying from $2,000 to $6,000 to individuals for the privilege of claiming an exemption. Many other organizations have objected to CBP One\u2019s intrusive surveillance and opted out altogether. \r\n\r\nThis Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) seeks an answer to a very simple set of easily answerable questions: \r\n1. \u201cHow many people have sought Title 42 exemptions through the CBP One app since its rollout by CBP?\u201d \r\n2.  \u201cHow many people did CBP grant Title 42 exemptions after receiving their information through the CBP One app since its rollout by CBP?\u201d  \r\n3. \u201cHow many civil society organizations has CBP authorized to facilitate Title 42 exemptions using CBP One?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnswers we Do NOT seek to through this FOIA: (a) personally identifiable information (PII) regarding individuals presented as applicants for exemptions through the CBP One app. Who, what, when, or where people crossed is not the subject of this request. \r\n\r\nRather, we simply want to know the total number of people granted Title 42 exemptions through CBP One, and the number of civil society orgs CBP has authorized to facilitate Title 42 exemptions using CBP One? \r\n\r\nDescription of Records Sought:\r\nWe request access to the following agency records from CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations and/or the Migrant Crisis Action Team: \r\n\r\n1. Any record demonstrating the total number of Title 42 exemptions sought through the CBP One app since its inception. (Note: We do not seek cumulative or duplicative records. Any single record evidencing this information will suffice.)\r\n2. Any record demonstrating the total number of Title 42 exemptions granted by CBP after receiving the applicant\u2019s information via the CBP One app. (Note: We do not seek cumulative or duplicative records. Any single record evidencing this information will suffice.)\r\n3. Any record demonstrating the total number of civil society (i.e., not government) who have used the CBP One app to facilitate Title 42 exemptions? \r\n\r\nWe believe the most likely custodians of these records will be CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations (OFO) and/or the Migrant Crisis Action Team (MCAT). We believe these records are most likely stored in an excel spreadsheet containing data exported from CBP One or a related interface. We believe these sheets are, at minimum, stored on a shared drive. We further believe CBP\u2019s Office of Information Technology (OIT) could facilitate a prompt and adequate search for response records. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request: \r\nPursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), we hereby request Expedited Processing of this request, and hereby certify that the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.1746: \r\n1. Humanitarian issues and national policy debates around Title 42 are a matter of widespread media interest about which serious questions exist as to the government\u2019s performance of its duties and legal obligations. So serious, in fact, that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held on November 15, 2022, that Title 42 was arbitrary and capricious when issued. Evidence in the Huisha Huisha case from CDC whistleblowers indicates the public health determinations on which Title 42 are allegedly based originated outside of CDC, and are unsupported by scientific consensus. \r\n\r\n2. December 22, 2022, is reportedly the date on which Title 42 will cease to be in effect. Public reporting in Axios reflects the Biden administration expects a high volume of individuals may return and seek admission and protection under humanitarian laws including the Refugee Convention and the Convention Against Torture. \r\n\r\n3. CBP One has created a massive market for exemption payments in Mexico, with demands from some CBP-chosen organizations ranging from $2000-$6000 per individual seeking exemption through CBP One. With roughly 700 exemptions available per day, this represents a ~$10M-~$30M/week government-created market for entry to the U.S. using the CBP One app. This amounts to as much as $1.5bn in fees paid by migrants in a given year.\r\n\r\n4. This commodification of safety has put individuals and organizations at risk of extortion by cartels in Mexico.\r\n\r\n5. CBP has had actual awareness of these extortion risks to civil society organizations, as applied to CBP One, for at least several weeks prior to the filing of this FOIA request.\r\n\r\n6. Failure to promptly search for and provide responsive records will harm our project\u2019s ability to accurately confirm unofficial assessments of the scope of the CBP One market BEFORE the scheduled end of Title 42, which will be vital to effectively advocating a workable future for the CBP One app. Processing this request in the ordinary course would render the records sought useless for the purposes we seek them because we could still be waiting for records months or even years after the policy change on the ground is set to occur. \r\n\r\nFOIA Information Demands\r\nPursuant to 5 USC 552, on behalf of Al Otro Lado\u2019s #DetentionKills Transparency Project, we demand that CBP: \r\n1. Acknowledge receipt of this request within 10 calendar days. \r\n2. Assign this request an individualized tracking number within 10 calendar days. \r\n3. Adjudicate and respond to the Expedited Processing request within 10 calendar days. \r\n4. Provide a response to this request as soon as practicable, or no later than 30 business days after receiving this request. \r\n5. Provide an estimated date on which the agency intends to release records within 20 calendar days of receiving this request. \r\n6. Task an adequate search reasonably calculated to locate the above requested records, and notify all relevant custodians in writing of their obligations to identify, preserve, and search for responsive records. \r\n7. Make all reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions of responsive agency records promptly available in native format. (E.g., release an excel spreadsheet in .xls or xlsx) \r\n8. Provide the name of an agency official who made the required determination of foreseeable harm for any record withheld as exempt. \r\n9. Notify us in writing of our right to appeal any denial, regardless whether the denial was in whole or in part. \r\n10. Assign our request a simple-track processing designation.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this request. \r\n\r\nAndrew Free \r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

By this letter, we concur with your assessment, and remand your case file to FOIA Division for immediate processing of your request.In your initial request, you sought total number of people granted Title 42 exemptions through CBP One, and the number of civil society orgs CBP has authorized to facilitate Title 42 exemptions using CBP One? As of 06/02/2023, FOIA Division, the office responsible for responding to initial FOIA requests, has not yet responded to your request. In your appeal, you contend that \u201cthe agency has failed to provide a timely response within the statutorily provided guidelines. We concur. The FOIA itself requires that each agency, absent unusual or exceptional circumstances, \u201cdetermine within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of any such request whether to comply with such request.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(6)(A)(i). As CBP\u2019s FOIA Division has not responded to your FOIA request within this statutory timeframe, we agree that the agency is delinquent in responding to your request.However, we find that an administrative appeal is an inappropriate cure in this instance.  Indeed, a requester \u201cshall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to such request if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions of this paragraph.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(i).  Instead, a constructive denial allows a requester to proceed directly to district court if an agency fails to respond to an initial request within the prescribed time period.  This determination is consistent with the language of the FOIA itself and the DHS regulations governing FOIA requests.Under the FOIA\u2019s administrative appeal provision, a requester has the right to administratively appeal any adverse determination that an agency makes on his or her FOIA request.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(6)(A).  Under DHS regulations, adverse determinations include denials of records in full or in part, \u201cno records\u201d responses, denials of requests for fee waivers and denials of requests for expedited processing. See 6 CFR 5.6(c). We note that the definition does not explicitly include a failure to respond.The administrative appeal process is important to agencies and requesters because the appeal process provides an agency with an opportunity to review its initial action taken in response to a request to determine whether corrective steps are necessary.  The appeals process allows CBP to correct mistakes made at lower levels and thereby obviates unnecessary judicial review.  In this case, there is no administrative record to review because FOIA Division has not yet processed the request. Accordingly, we are remanding your request to FOIA Division for processing.  As mentioned above, you may immediately challenge FOIA Division\u2019s failure to respond to your request in district court. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(a)(4)(B), you may do so in the U.S. District Court in the district in which you reside or have a principle place of business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.Alternatively, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) offers mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.  If you wish to contact OGIS, you may email them at ogis@nara.gov or call 1-877-684-6448.Please note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

Upon initial review of your request, we have determined that the following documents can be found on the internet at the following link: https://www.cbp.gov/document/foia-record/cbp-one-mobile-application \nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account], mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \n\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \n\nPlease notate file number CBP-FO-2023-018650 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

We have designated your inquiry as FOIA Request # 202500081F. Please include this request number on all correspondence with the FOIA office.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following information:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  A copy of the complete list of actions taken in response to OPM's January 29, 2025, memo entitled: \"Initial Guidance Regarding President Trump's Executive Order Defending Women\" and the President's Executive Order entitled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  A copy of any agency plans to fully comply with OPM's January 29, 2025, memo entitled: \"Initial Guidance Regarding President Trump's Executive Order Defending Women\" and the President's Executive Order entitled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government. \"\r\n\r\nWe respond to requests on a first-in, first-out basis and on a multi-track system. Your request has been placed on the complex track. You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to identify specific documents in order to be eligible for the faster track. To do so, please send a written request, identifying the specific documents sought, to Export-Import Bank of the United States, 811 Vermont Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20571, ATTN: FOIA OFFICER. You may also submit a narrowed request via E-Mail at foia@exim.gov<mailto:foia@exim.gov>. The phrase \"Narrowed Request\" should appear on the letter and on the outside of the envelope containing the narrowed request or in the \"Subject\" line of the E-Mail. Please include the request number listed above on all correspondence with the FOIA office. We will notify you if your request is placed in the simple track.\r\n\r\nEXIM intends to disclose the requested records to the fullest extent of the law. Please be assured that we are processing your request as expeditiously as possible. However, the records you seek require a search in another Office, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\" See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii). Because of these unusual circumstances, we need to extend the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute. We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request. The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and the volume and complexity of any records located. In an effort to speed up your records search, you may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative timeframe for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison, Ms. Lennell Jackson at (202) 565-3290. Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, please feel free to contact me.

The outage affected our ability to access the system and deleted requests that were already in the system. We estimate we have lost requests submitted since November 2024. As of March 19, 2025, the system is partially available, and we are now able to proceed with accepting new requests and assigning accurate FOIA numbers for any requests received from February 14, 2025, through March 21, 2025. We are working with our vendor\u2019s technical team to resolve any remaining issues and restore any deleted information as soon as possible. Please know we certainly understand the importance of your request and are working diligently to provide the information you have requested, but due to the outage it may take longer for us to provide our response.\r\n\r\nThe status of your request is as follows:\r\n\r\nWe have conducted the initial review and have submitted the documents to our Legal Division for review. Therefore, we estimate we will be able to provide a response within three weeks.

Gen Wins briefed: \"There was an out of house consortium that was created and there are some alumni who recognizing kind of how fast this thing is moving, they went and got involved in this consortium where they are some cadet athletes, basketball players. There's an agreement on them here. Now there's two other features that are separate from the NIL. There's an Academic Achievement Fund, which we did. Okay. And the Academic Achievement Fund is set up in such a way where if you stay at VMI and you perform academically at a certain level, right, then you would get a sum of money and I'm pretty sure academic achievement was upon graduation. There's a second one that's called the Austin Fund which operates similarly. Okay. And I know that that one is upon graduation you would get this the equivalent of I believe $5,000 a year. Right. For four years. So when you graduate in four years, the Austin fund would get you somewhere about $20,000. You have those, those two arrangements as well, which we are participating in right now. It largely affects only basketball. It largely only affects basketball.\" He also briefed that the budget projection is based on increased ticket sales. He also mentioned \"Jamal\" attended a Keydet Club meeting covering the NIL and consortiuum and has the slides and other materials from that. This FOIA requests \r\n\r\n1. Records showing the struture, operations and policies of the NIL consortiuum Maj. Gen. Wins Mentioned. Again, these records include Keydet Club and Alumni Agencies slides, documents, agreements, and other materials given to him that, as a result, become discloseable Public Records.\r\n2. Records showing the amunt paid out of the Academic Achievement Fund since its creation and THE SOURCE OF THOSE FUNDS (student fees, donors (who?), state funds, etc.).\r\n3. Records showing how much, if anything, cadets are charged or any funds form cadet athletic or other student fees for admission to or their attendence at NCAA Football and NCAA basketball events regardless if these are considered \"tickets\" or not for the past 2 academic years.\r\n\r\n#1 and especially #3 should be readily available and should not take more than the 5 day maximum. I am willing to accept any of these immediately available rather than wait for all records if needed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",
