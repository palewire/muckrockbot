There does not appear to be a statute in CT for obstruction of justice per se, however, the crimes may fall under threatening or harassment.  My complaint to the Stratford Police and Court filings detail the nature of the threats against my active participation in multiple matters in the Stratford Probate Court.  Because the threats involved multiple CT police departments and the interstate transmission/cooperation between police agencies in Ct and Arizona, a laundry list of federal crimes may have been committed related to this issue.\r\n\r\nThe filings in the Stratford Probate Court have detailed information and are located at the muckrock website here,\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_request_attachments/s_huminski%40live.com/148926/4_filing_merge_7-17-2023.pdf\r\n\r\nFOIA requests have been filed with the police departments involved which also contain this data; Wilton CT, Norwalk CT, Gilbert AZ.\r\n\r\nAt this early stage, I realize that you may only have initial information concerning the complaint filed with your department.  Please provide.  I will also attach a copy of the court filings to this request which also contains copies of the emails sent to your agency as a formal criminal complaint.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be processed by a representative of the news media/press and made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nscott huminski",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nFiles mentioning or generated during or as a result of Operation Sundevil, a 1990 nationwide United States Secret Service crackdown on \"illegal computer hacking activities.\" The Secret Service operated in coordination with the Central Intelligence Agency. It involved raids in approximately fifteen different cities and resulted in three arrests and the confiscation of computers, the contents of electronic bulletin board systems (BBSes), and floppy disks. It was revealed in a press release on May 9, 1990. The arrests and subsequent court cases resulted in the creation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The operation is now seen as largely a public-relations stunt. Operation Sundevil has also been viewed as one of the preliminary attacks on the Legion of Doom and similar hacking groups. The raid on Steve Jackson Games, which led to the court case Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service, is often attributed to Operation Sundevil, but the Electronic Frontier Foundation states that it is unrelated and cites this attribution as a media error.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEmily Crose",

MR149335\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nEmail:  149335-82635795@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nDear Tammy Mercure:\r\n\r\nThis letter is an acknowledgement of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request received in this office on July 18, 2023.  The Department of the Interior (DOI) tracking number for this request is DOI-NPS-2023-005681.  Please cite this tracking number in any future communication with our office regarding your request.  You requested the following from Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe collection of photographs of the destruction of Fazendeville. Fazendeville was a small Black community located by the Chalmette Battlefield which is part of the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve Louisiana. The homeowners had their homes seized through eminent domain in 1964 and the homes were bulldozed that year. I have been told that Guy Hughes, a park employee, has the photographs under his supervision. We would like the whole collection of photographs of Fazendeville, including the photographs of the properties being bulldozed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of the National Park Service to; (1) make records available to the public to the greatest extent possible in keeping with the spirit of FOIA, (2) make documents available as early as possible while protecting the rights of the individuals involved, and (3) withhold documents falling within one of the FOIA exemptions or in cases where the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would be harmful to an interest protected by an exemption.\r\n\r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the news media.  As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.37(g)\r\n\r\nWe use Multitrack Processing to process FOIA requests.  The Simple track is for requests that would generally take one to five workdays to process.  The Normal track is for requests that would generally take six to twenty workdays to process.  The Complex track is for requests that would generally take twenty-one to sixty workdays to process.  The Extraordinary track is for requests that would generally take more than sixty workdays to process.  The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing, which are processed as soon as practicable.  Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the \u201cNormal\u201d processing track.  There are 95 requests pending ahead of yours in this processing track.  In addition, there are 17 \"Simple\" and 8 \"Complex\" requests ahead of yours.  Please note that we currently have a significant backlog of requests but are working diligently to address the pending requests as quickly as possible. The approximate determination date for your request is December 2024.\r\n\r\nWe apologize for this delay in finalizing our decision. You may narrow the scope of your request to obtain quicker processing in your currently-assigned track or move the request into a different track (which may have the effect of reducing the cost of processing your request and having it processed more quickly).  You also may agree to an alternative time period for processing by communicating with us, our FOIA Requester Center, or the FOIA Public Liaison.  Contact information for the Department\u2019s FOIA Requester Centers and FOIA Public Liaison is available at https://www.doi.gov/foia/foiacenters.  You may also seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).  If you choose to contact OGIS, you may do so in any of the following ways:\r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\nE-mail: ogis@nara.gov\r\nWeb: https://ogis.archives.gov\r\nTelephone: 202-741-5770\r\nFax: 202-741-5769\r\nToll-free: 1-877-684-6448\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest in the National Park Service.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at ser_foia@nps.gov.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDenise Ratajczak\r\nRegional FOIA Officer",
