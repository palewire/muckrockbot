Such documents may include but should not be limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; photographs; and all records of communications between employees of DoD and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Wardens,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\n\"Wardens\" appears on a list of DoD entertainment industry collaborations released to me through FOIA. The list is attached to this request.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation as well as the editor-in-chief and a contributor to a research magazine published by said foundation titled \"Cultural Engineering Studies.\" These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Such communications may include, but should not be limited to, emails, correspondence, memos, and transcriptions of telephone calls. \r\n\r\nA previous request from me was rejected by the FBI on the grounds that it would violate Mr. Harris's personal privacy to even acknowledge the existence of such records. As I wrote in my appeal, which was never processed, I do not think this provision applies to my request. To show this, I will first limit the scope of my request to communications between Mr. Harris and the FBI to those communications which are relevant to Mr. Harris's professional work as a writer and novelist. Such communications could not involve a reasonable expectation that they would not be subject to FOIA. Furthermore, even if certain third-party communications are not subject to FOIA, the FBI's own written communications are still subject to FOIA, and my request includes communications from the FBI.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
