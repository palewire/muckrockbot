THE \"ORDER OF THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH SUSPENSION OF FOOD SERVICE LICENSE\" NATIVE FILE A copy of the native electronic file (original .doc, .docx, or .pdf format) for the document titled or known as the \"ORDER OF THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH SUSPENSION OF FOOD SERVICE LICENSE\" authored by Lisa Morrissey, Health Department Director and prepared by Fernada Carvalho as noted by initials on the face of the document regarding Hat City Ale House. A copy of the document is attached to this FOI request.\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirement: I am specifically requesting the metadata associated with this file, including but not limited to: Date of Creation, Date of Last Modification, Authoring User, and File Path.\r\n\r\n2. FILING AND AUDIT TRAIL RECORDS All records, including emails, internal memos, or \"Records Disposal Authorizations\" (Form RC-075), that document the date this document was placed into the physical folder of the Health Department.\r\n\r\n3.  THE \"CEASE AND DESIST\" NATIVE FILE A copy of the native electronic file (original .doc, .docx, or .pdf format) for the document titled or known as the \"CEASE AND DESIST\" authored by Lisa Morrissey, Health Department Director and prepared by Fernada Carvalho as noted by initials on the face of the document regarding Hat City Ale House. A copy of the document is attached to this FOI request.\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirement: I am specifically requesting the metadata associated with this file, including but not limited to: Date of Creation, Date of Last Modification, Authoring User, and File Path.\r\n\r\n4. FILING AND AUDIT TRAIL RECORDS All records, including emails, internal memos, or \"Records Disposal Authorizations\" (Form RC-075), that document the date this document was placed into the physical folder of the Health Department.\r\n\r\n5. All communications with the Connecticut Health Department in connection with the above referenced documents and Hat City Ale House from May 2018 to the present.\r\n\r\n6. All copies of the above referenced documents in possession of Sean Hearty, both as Permit Center Director/Coordinator and Zoning Enforcement Officer, Danbury Planning and zoning.\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirement: I am specifically requesting the metadata associated with these files, including but not limited to: Date of Creation, Date of Last Modification, Authoring User, and File Path.\r\n\r\n7. FILING AND AUDIT TRAIL RECORDS All records, including emails, internal memos, or \"Records Disposal Authorizations\" (Form RC-075), that document the date this document was placed into the physical folder of the Health Department.\r\n\r\nRecords obtained recently from the Office of the Public Records Administrator show that the latest records destroyed by the Danbury Health Department are from 2017. If any of these requested records have been destroyed, please include the properly executed RC-075 documents. I am also requesting that the Health Department refrain from destroying any records in connection with Hat City Ale house, Kevin Paige, or Paige Enterprises, Inc. until the fulfillment of this request is considered complete by both parties.\r\n\r\nFormat: Per CGS \u00a7 1-212(g), I request these records in their original electronic format to preserve the integrity of the embedded metadata. Providing a scanned PDF or a paper printout of an electronic file is a \"denial of access\" to the metadata which is itself a public record.\r\n\r\nFeel free to respond through this portal if there is any need for clarification of this request.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Paige",
