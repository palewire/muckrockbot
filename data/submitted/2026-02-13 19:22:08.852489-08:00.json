I am not requesting personally identifying information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the following, organized by calendar year (2016\u2013present):\r\n\r\n1. The total number of requests for University-administered safe leave (paid, unpaid, or in conjunction with accrued leave), broken down by:\r\n\r\n   - qualifying purpose category under ORS 659A.272, and\r\n   - outcome (approved, denied, redirected to another leave category, delayed, or otherwise modified).\r\n\r\n2. For any denials, delays, or redirections, records sufficient to show:\r\n\r\n   - the year of the determination,\r\n   - the qualifying purpose category under ORS 659A.272, and\r\n   - the stated reason for the denial, delay, limitation, or redirection.\r\n\r\n3. Any aggregate summaries, tracking records, or reports the University maintains that reflect how ORS 659A University-administered safe leave has been administered over time.\r\n\r\n4. Identification of where the University has posted or maintained the notices required under ORS 659A.279 and ORS 659A.283, including:\r\n\r\n   - physical posting locations,\r\n   - electronic locations where those notices have been made available to employees (including remote employees), and\r\n   - the dates those notices were in effect at those locations.\r\n\r\n5. Any records, guidance, training materials, or communications indicating that:\r\n\r\n   - certain qualifying purposes were treated as atypical or outside normal use,\r\n   - eligibility was evaluated based on the nature of the allegation or proceeding rather than the statutory criteria, or\r\n   - certification from a health-care or service provider was considered insufficient under ORS 659A.280.\r\n\r\n6. A year-by-year numerical summary of the number of times the University notified complainants who alleged they were victims of conduct covered by ORS 659A.272 of the availability of University-administered safe leave protections, as required under the notice obligations set forth in ORS 659A.279 and ORS 659A.283, including:\r\n\r\n    - the office providing the notice (e.g., OEOA/OICRC, Human Resources, HR Leaves, Workplace ADA, Employee & Labor Relations, or other),\r\n    - the category of qualifying conduct or bias identified (reported only by category and count),\r\n    - any records or aggregate data reflecting whether notification or access to safe leave was tracked, administered, or categorized differently based on the type of alleged bias (for example, disability-related complaints, ADA retaliation, race,       \r\n       sex/gender, or other protected categories), and\r\n    - any aggregate records reflecting how or when such notice was provided as part of complaint or response processes pursuant to ORS 659A.279 and ORS 659A.283.\r\n\r\n\r\nNames and identifying details are not requested and may be redacted.\r\n\r\nClarification regarding parallel processes:\r\n\r\nTo avoid any confusion, this public records request is submitted pursuant to Oregon Public Records Law only and does not waive, replace, or otherwise affect any requests, grievances, or RFIs I have submitted through my union or any other employment-related process, many of which remain pending.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted because I require timely access to records necessary to understand my statutory protections and to plan accordingly. The public records process is the only mechanism currently available to obtain this information within a reasonable timeframe.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records electronically. If the information is maintained in summary or report form, those summaries are sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
