That prior release confirms that such presentation materials are regularly prepared, used, and subject to disclosure under the Public Records Law.\r\n\r\nBy way of example, additional Community CompStat presentations were held in District D-4 (South End) on Aug 27th, and in other districts citywide during this August and September 2025 time period.  Feel free to exclude the Aug 26 E-13 presentation that has already been provided if it makes it easier for you. \r\n\r\nPlease provide the complete presentation materials (e.g., PowerPoint, slide deck, PDF, or other format) as displayed at each meeting.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrian McCarter",
