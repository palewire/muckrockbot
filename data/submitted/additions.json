Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2013 to July 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, date of birth or age, job title and/or class, job and/or class code, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, county of employment, original hire date, termination date, civil service status (i.e., whether the employee is covered by the State Personnel Law (SPL) in the given year), and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am requesting more detailed data at more frequent intervals than is published here: https://mapyourtaxes.mo.gov/MAP/Download/Default.aspx. \r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly or annual intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",
