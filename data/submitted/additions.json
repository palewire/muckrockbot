If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, and am currently a reporter of The Boston Globe.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

OCR does not cure the destruction of the original structural metadata that makes it accessible, nor make available the parts of the records (such as hyperlinks, headers, etc) which were destroyed by rasterization.

They are generally in plain text or multipart MIME HTML format, which can be directly edited to make redactions if needed. You say that record #4 is a Web page; please provide it in original electronic format, such as HTM or MHTML. \r\n\r\nMy form and format request is mandatory under 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) & (f)(2)(A) (E-FOIA & FOIA Improvement Act) and 29 USC 794d (Rehab Act \u00a7 508).\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai",

FOIA does not impose an unbounded obligation to create requested information in a way that is usable or convenient for the requester. ACUS always attempts to provide records in the requested format, but that is not always possible. This reply is our best effort to provide you with the information without having to pay contractors to manipulate or present the information in your desired format.  There are no in-house IT personnel at our micro agency.\r\n\r\nYou will find attached two Outlook files-both sent to you yesterday in .pdf format. One file was modified to remove PII (after forwarding the document to myself so that it could be redacted). All links and such should be active. The redacted .pdf attachment to the redacted email was sent to you yesterday.\r\n\r\nAs for item 4, you specifically noted that ACUS could reply in a statement, which we did. ACUS has zero FTEs.  I attached the information about the FOIA.gov webpage as a convenience to you. If you have questions about that webpage, you should contact the Office of Information Policy at DOJ since they maintain the webpage.\r\n\r\nFinally, you requested that the documents be uploaded to some sort of database for which you provided a link.  It is a security risk to click on links from unknown sources. In any event, FOIA does not require agencies to plug their responses into a requester's database.\r\n\r\n\r\nShawne C.
