Given the breadth of potentially responsive records and the extensive time that may be needed to review them, are there specific municipalities or agencies whose records you are specifically seeking? Or is there a specific type of information or record you are more narrowly interested in, rather than all documents? \r\nUpon receiving clarification, your request will be forwarded to the appropriate program area(s) to identify documents that are responsive to your request and which may be made available pursuant to all applicable provisions of the Freedom of Information Law. If we do not receive clarification within 30 days, we will presume that your request is withdrawn. \r\nPlease note that, pursuant to Article 6 of the Public Officers Law, a charge may be applied to your request, including the actual cost of the medium used to respond to your Freedom of Information Law request and/or other related costs.

Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 181 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 232 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 659 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 998 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nHolly Early\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS)\r\nFBI-Records Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nPIO: (540) 868-4593\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391/4997\r\nE-mail: foiparequest@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foiparequest@ic.fbi.gov>\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

The FBI has located approximately 3,404 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-100 page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing.  Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nWe contact requesters with requests of this size to see if there might be a way to possibly narrow the scope.  Is this something you might be willing to consider?  If so, please contact me and we can discuss this possibility.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\nLeslie Wilson\r\n540-868-4894\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nNegotiation/RIDS/RMD\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nI have just finished going through the records on the subject of October Surprise.  To focus on the significant file sections on this subject for this request would put a page count at about 900 pages.  I've eliminated the subfiles because the material was duplicative in main file sections.  There appears to be quite a bit of duplication of the documents.  There is a perjury file that was determined not to stick for a couple of persons testifying before the House committee on this subject.  The main file investigation can be addressed by starting with sections until the documents would exceed the medium-track queue.  Some of the material contains articles and congressional handbook material.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you are interested in approaching the subject files in a way we can provide the basis of the investigation, overall summary.  This approach is basically to \"chip\" away at the sections in increments under the 950 threshold.  Some documents may contain other government agency equities and will be processed when guidance is given on the other equity.  The subfiles to eliminate consist of 473 pages, reducing the overall size of your request to under 3,000 pages.\r\n\r\nFor the medium track processing queue, If sections are processed a few at a time, it will also allow for you to see how exemptions (if applicable) are being used.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts on this.\nSincerely,\r\nLeslie Wilson",

All requests are processed in the order in which they are received, and no requests are prioritized by deadline date. The amount of time to completely process your request depends upon the number of pending requests, volume of material encompassed in the request, and the amount of redaction, if any, that is necessary.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware, if you are requesting records with large amount of body camera videos and or high-profile cases, the time to complete your request may be significantly longer as these cases are often voluminous. Identifying the specific record(s) being requested may help expedite your request. You will be notified once records are made available for you to download or pick up, or if no records are found. Your tracking # is 2013. When checking the status of your request, please send emails to mediarequest@mcso.maricopa.gov<mailto:mediarequest@mcso.maricopa.gov> and include your tracking # 2013.\r\n\r\n***Effective February 1, 2024, pursuant to ARS 39-129, the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office (MCSO) Legal Liaison Section has implemented a new fee schedule for requests for video recordings.  The fee for processing video recordings is $25 per each video-hour ($6.25 per quarter hour).  In the event there are contemporaneous multiple requests for the same video, the cost associated with processing the video will be shared equally between all requesting parties at that time. Requests for previously processed videos will be at no cost unless the requestor wishes to receive a hard copy instead of an electronic copy. Fees for hardcopies are listed below. ***\r\n\r\nThe fee breakdown for hard copies are as follows:\r\n\r\nDocuments:                       $.50 for each page\r\n\r\nCD\u2019s:                                      $15.00 each\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DAD2B3.2C4158F0]\r\n\r\nSgt.

Delaney (d. 1989). Proof of death is not required as he has an entry in the Dead List: https://archive.org/details/FBIRIDsDeadList2018/page/n209/mode/2up?view=theater\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPaul Galante",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the FOIA deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

This is estimating one minute per document on the low end and one minute per page on the high end using the VT Secretary of State's Uniform Charges Schedule fee of $0.45 per minute.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you would like to have me narrow by keyword or other search parameter and I can give you a second estimate.\r\n\r\nHave a great weekend,\r\nJoe\r\n\r\n--\r\nJoseph Dempsey\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nCity Attorney's Office\r\nThe City of Burlington, Vermont\r\njdempsey@burlingtonvt.gov<mailto:jdempsey@burlingtonvt.gov>\r\n\r\nPlease note that this communication and any response to it will be maintained as a public record and may be subject to disclosure under the Vermont Public Records Act.\n",

For example, you may find his New York Times obituary at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/obituaries/howard-fineman-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an investigative journalist who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This would give me the license number for that dealer, in this\r\ncase 44485.  I would then search for any complaints we have associated with\r\nthat license number.  I would then go into OnBase and search for\r\ninvestigations based on that license number.  I would cross reference the\r\ncomplaints from MLO with the results in OnBase to make sure they agree.  I\r\nthen printed all of the reports associated with the cases with the\r\nexception of the case that was presented to the Motor Vehicle Dealer\r\nBoard.  For that case I provided the affidavit of probable cause instead of\r\nthe report.  I then provided all of these reports and the affidavit to the\r\nCORA staff in order for them to be redacted and provided to the requestor*.\r\n\r\n\r\n Muckrock ORA comms Redacted\r\n<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ico0cVAh_xQxxQRqSO1_UVLQsayGwmzE>\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMelissa\r\n*Department of Revenue CORA Manager/Administrator*\r\nwww.colorado.gov/revenue/cora",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Barbara Thomas Judge.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Gerald Shur.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nEFOIA Request\r\n\r\nI was seeking the release of all files related to the Historic 'Sharebeast' case as highlighted by the quoted press release from the Department of Justice.\r\n\r\nOwner of Sharebeast.com sentenced for copyright infringement\r\n\r\nATLANTA - Artur Sargsyan has been sentenced for the crime of criminal copyright infringement for private financial gain while operating a massive file-sharing infrastructure that distributed approximately 1 billion copies of copyrighted musical works through Internet downloads.  Sargsyan\u2019s file-sharing websites, which contained numerous pop-up advertisements, generated significant profit for him when visitors accessed the websites to illegally download copyrighted works.\r\n\r\n\u201cSargsyan operated one of the most successful illegal music sharing websites on the Internet,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak.  \u201cHis reproduction of copyrighted musical works were made available only to generate undeserved profits for himself.  The incredible work done by our law enforcement partners and prosecutors in light of the complexity of Sargsyan\u2019s operation demonstrates that we will employ all of our resources to stop this kind of theft.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sargsyan was warned several times that he was violating the law by illegally sharing copyrighted works, but chose to ignore those warnings,\u201d said David J. LaValley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. \u201cHis sentence sends a message that no matter how complex the operation, the FBI, its federal partners and law enforcement partners around the globe will go to every length to protect the property of hard working artists and the companies that produce their art.\u201d  \r\n\r\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges and other information presented in court: Artur Sargsyan owned and operated a number of websites including Sharebeast.com, Newjams.net, and Albumjams.com.  From at least 2012 through 2015, Sargsyan illegally distributed and reproduced copyrighted works through Sharebeast.com.  Using a network of websites that he owned and operated, including Newjams.net and Albumjams.com, Sargsyan created links to a wide swath of copyright-protected music that was stored on Sharebeast.com.  Sharebeast illegally stored and distributed works from scores of artists, including Bruno Mars, Linkin Park, Pitbull, Pharrell Williams, Gwen Stefani, Maroon 5, Ariana Grande, Destiny\u2019s Child, Ciara, Katy Perry, Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, Kanye West, and Justin Bieber.  Meanwhile, Sargsyan profited from the distribution of the copies of these copyrighted works.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America (\u201cRIAA\u201d), Sharebeast.com was the largest online file-sharing website specializing in the reproduction and distribution of infringing copies of copyrighted music operating out of the United States.  From 2012 to 2015, the RIAA sent Sargsyan over 100 e-mails notifying him that Sharebeast.com was illegally hosting and sharing copyright-infringing works.  Sargsyan continued, however, to make the copyright-infringing files available for download, disregarding the many warnings that he received.  The RIAA conservatively estimated the total monetary loss to its member companies at $6.3 billion.\r\n\r\nArtur Sargsyan, 30, of Glendale, California, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr., to five years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $458,200.  He was also ordered to forfeit $184,768.87.

Sargsyan\u2019s file-sharing websites, which contained numerous pop-up advertisements, generated significant profit for him when visitors accessed the websites to illegally download copyrighted works.\r\n\r\n\u201cSargsyan operated one of the most successful illegal music sharing websites on the Internet,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak. \u201cHis reproduction of copyrighted musical works were made available only to generate undeserved profits for himself. The incredible work done by our law enforcement partners and prosecutors in light of the complexity of Sargsyan\u2019s operation demonstrates that we will employ all of our resources to stop this kind of theft.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sargsyan was warned several times that he was violating the law by illegally sharing copyrighted works, but chose to ignore those warnings,\u201d said David J. LaValley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. \u201cHis sentence sends a message that no matter how complex the operation, the FBI, its federal partners and law enforcement partners around the globe will go to every length to protect the property of hard working artists and the companies that produce their art.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges and other information presented in court: Artur Sargsyan owned and operated a number of websites including Sharebeast.com, Newjams.net, and Albumjams.com. From at least 2012 through 2015, Sargsyan illegally distributed and reproduced copyrighted works through Sharebeast.com. Using a network of websites that he owned and operated, including Newjams.net and Albumjams.com, Sargsyan created links to a wide swath of copyright-protected music that was stored on Sharebeast.com. Sharebeast illegally stored and distributed works from scores of artists, including Bruno Mars, Linkin Park, Pitbull, Pharrell Williams, Gwen Stefani, Maroon 5, Ariana Grande, Destiny\u2019s Child, Ciara, Katy Perry, Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, Kanye West, and Justin Bieber. Meanwhile, Sargsyan profited from the distribution of the copies of these copyrighted works.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America (\u201cRIAA\u201d), Sharebeast.com was the largest online file-sharing website specializing in the reproduction and distribution of infringing copies of copyrighted music operating out of the United States. From 2012 to 2015, the RIAA sent Sargsyan over 100 e-mails notifying him that Sharebeast.com was illegally hosting and sharing copyright-infringing works. Sargsyan continued, however, to make the copyright-infringing files available for download, disregarding the many warnings that he received. The RIAA conservatively estimated the total monetary loss to its member companies at $6.3 billion.\r\n\r\nArtur Sargsyan, 30, of Glendale, California, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr., to five years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $458,200. He was also ordered to forfeit $184,768.87. Sargsyan was convicted on these charges on September 1, 2017, after he pleaded guilty.\r\n\r\nThis case was investigated by the FBI.\r\n\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Samir Kaushal and Kamal Ghali prosecuted the case. John Zacharia, formerly the Deputy Chief for Litigation for the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, previously prosecuted the case. The prosecution reflects a coordinated effort by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS), the Office of International Affairs, the FBI\u2019s field offices in Atlanta, Denver, Chicago, and Los Angeles, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California. Substantial assistance was provided by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency and the Ministry of Security and Justice in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nFor further information please contact the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Public Affairs Office at USAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.gov or (404) 581-6016. The Internet address for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia is http://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga.\r\n\r\nVAUGHN Index requested for any materials cited in exemption.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Good day:\r\nCan you confirm a referral request was received from the FBI related to this request?  Agency isn't responding to status requests.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nWilliam\r\n\r\nOriginal Request Shown Below\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nEFOIA Request\r\n\r\nI was seeking the release of all files related to the Historic 'Sharebeast' case as highlighted by the quoted press release from the Department of Justice.\r\n\r\nOwner of Sharebeast.com sentenced for copyright infringement\r\n\r\nATLANTA - Artur Sargsyan has been sentenced for the crime of criminal copyright infringement for private financial gain while operating a massive file-sharing infrastructure that distributed approximately 1 billion copies of copyrighted musical works through Internet downloads. Sargsyan\u2019s file-sharing websites, which contained numerous pop-up advertisements, generated significant profit for him when visitors accessed the websites to illegally download copyrighted works.\r\n\r\n\u201cSargsyan operated one of the most successful illegal music sharing websites on the Internet,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak. \u201cHis reproduction of copyrighted musical works were made available only to generate undeserved profits for himself. The incredible work done by our law enforcement partners and prosecutors in light of the complexity of Sargsyan\u2019s operation demonstrates that we will employ all of our resources to stop this kind of theft.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sargsyan was warned several times that he was violating the law by illegally sharing copyrighted works, but chose to ignore those warnings,\u201d said David J. LaValley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. \u201cHis sentence sends a message that no matter how complex the operation, the FBI, its federal partners and law enforcement partners around the globe will go to every length to protect the property of hard working artists and the companies that produce their art.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges and other information presented in court: Artur Sargsyan owned and operated a number of websites including Sharebeast.com, Newjams.net, and Albumjams.com. From at least 2012 through 2015, Sargsyan illegally distributed and reproduced copyrighted works through Sharebeast.com. Using a network of websites that he owned and operated, including Newjams.net and Albumjams.com, Sargsyan created links to a wide swath of copyright-protected music that was stored on Sharebeast.com. Sharebeast illegally stored and distributed works from scores of artists, including Bruno Mars, Linkin Park, Pitbull, Pharrell Williams, Gwen Stefani, Maroon 5, Ariana Grande, Destiny\u2019s Child, Ciara, Katy Perry, Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, Kanye West, and Justin Bieber. Meanwhile, Sargsyan profited from the distribution of the copies of these copyrighted works.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America (\u201cRIAA\u201d), Sharebeast.com was the largest online file-sharing website specializing in the reproduction and distribution of infringing copies of copyrighted music operating out of the United States. From 2012 to 2015, the RIAA sent Sargsyan over 100 e-mails notifying him that Sharebeast.com was illegally hosting and sharing copyright-infringing works. Sargsyan continued, however, to make the copyright-infringing files available for download, disregarding the many warnings that he received. The RIAA conservatively estimated the total monetary loss to its member companies at $6.3 billion.\r\n\r\nArtur Sargsyan, 30, of Glendale, California, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr., to five years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $458,200. He was also ordered to forfeit $184,768.87. Sargsyan was convicted on these charges on September 1, 2017, after he pleaded guilty.\r\n\r\nThis case was investigated by the FBI.\r\n\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Samir Kaushal and Kamal Ghali prosecuted the case. John Zacharia, formerly the Deputy Chief for Litigation for the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, previously prosecuted the case. The prosecution reflects a coordinated effort by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS), the Office of International Affairs, the FBI\u2019s field offices in Atlanta, Denver, Chicago, and Los Angeles, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California. Substantial assistance was provided by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency and the Ministry of Security and Justice in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nFor further information please contact the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Public Affairs Office at USAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.gov or (404) 581-6016. The Internet address for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia is http://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga.\r\n\r\nVAUGHN Index requested for any materials cited in exemption.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWilliam Fernandes",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. All agency records pertaining to the decision by the Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) for the Middle District of Georgia (MDGa), to decline the recommended prosecution of former CoreCivic employee Freddy Wims for making false statements under oath in connection with the investigation of the death of Jeancarlo Alfonso Jimenez Joseph at the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, GA, on May 15, 2017, including, but not limited to, the Declination Memo created by the USAO MDGa. \r\n\r\n2. All agency records created or reviewed in connection with the following FOIA requests: \"CRM-3006-97176\"; EOUSA-2019-002865; A-2020-01304. \r\n\r\nPlease note the following history of the agency's failure to task an adequate search in response to similar previous requests: \r\nA. First, on May 8, 2019, I requested records from the DOJ Criminal Division pertaining to the declination of prosecution by the USAO for the MDGa. (See: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/doj-records-of-the-dhs-oigs-criminal-investigation-of-jean-jimenezs-death-department-of-justice-criminal-division-72898/#comms). DOJ acknowledged receiving this request on May 22, 2019, and assigned it a tracking number of CRM-3006-97176. In its May 22, 2019, acknowledgement letter, DOJ FOIA requested clarification as to the records requested. I provided the requested clarification the same day, indicating that because prosecution was declined, no case number was publicly available. Consequently, on July 5, 2019, DOJ-CRIM concluded my original request was \"misdirected\" and transferred that request to the Executive Office of United States Attorneys (EOUSA) and informed me it was treating the response as final and the case closed. I did not administratively appeal that determination because it appeared that DOJ-CRIM did not have responsive records, EOUSA did, and that EOUSA would commence a search for these records after it received DOJ-CRIM's intra-agency referral. To the best of my knowledge, I have never received an acknowledgement or individualized tracking number from EOUSA following DOJ-CRIM's July 5, 2019, referral of my May 8, 2019, \"misdirected\" request to EOUSA. \r\n\r\n2. Second, on May 8, 2019, I requested records from the EOUSA (independently from the referral by DOJ-CRIM). That request is available here: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/doj-records-of-the-dhs-oigs-criminal-investigation-of-jean-jimenezs-death-department-of-justice-executive-office-for-united-states-attorneys-72899/. On May 16, 2019, EOUSA acknowledged receipt of this request and assigned it tracking number EOUSA-2019-002865. On July 8, 2019, EOUSA informed me that it had conducted a search of the USAO for the Northern District of Georgia and located no responsive records. I replied on July 17, 2019,  by pointing out that the USAO MDGa had not been searched. EOUSA provided no response. On June 3, 2020, I administratively appealed the constructive denial of my FOIA request, which EOUSA assigned tracking number A-2020-01304. On July 20, 2020, EOUSA denied the appeal, determining it was untimely, because it was not filed within the 90-day period after EOUSA's July 8, 2019 decision. \r\n\r\nBased on the above, a currently-pending referral from DOJ-Crim to EOUSA of my \"misdirected\" request, which DOJ-CRIM initiated no later than July 5, 2019, remains unacknowledged and pending within EOUSA's FOIA files. I seek records responsive to that referral on an expedited basis, given that DOJ FOIA has failed to properly acknowledged the intra-agency transfer for nearly 3 years. \r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me at Andrew@DetentionKills.org if I can provide any clarification or additional information regarding this time-sensitive request. \r\n\r\nI make this request on behalf of the #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative, a project of Al Otro Lado. Its purpose is to inform the public of actual and alleged criminal wrongdoing by government contractors which DOJ officials have declined to prosecute. \r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this time-sensitive matter. \r\n\r\nBest regards, \r\n\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

For example, you may find his New York Times obituary at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/science/space/thomas-p-stafford-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files.

I am an associate editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?
