These sightings, widely described as \u201cmystery drones\u201d or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), have been the subject of significant public interest and media coverage.\r\n\r\nThis request specifically seeks access to all records created, received, or modified between November 1, 2024, and the date of this request's fulfillment. To ensure the identification of all responsive materials, this request includes references to \"mystery drones,\" \"UAP,\" \"unidentified flying objects (UFOs),\" \"unmanned aerial systems (UAS),\" \"unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\" \"aerial anomalies,\" or any similar terminology used to describe these aerial sightings.\r\n\r\nThe requested records include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nAudio and Video Files: All audio or video files received, recorded, or obtained by the department related to these sightings. This includes recordings made by departmental surveillance equipment, body-worn cameras, dashboard cameras, or agency-operated drones, as well as media submitted by citizens, contractors, or third parties. I request the original or highest-resolution versions of these files and associated metadata, including timestamps, geolocation data, technical specifications of recording devices, and any embedded identifiers for classification, dissemination tracking, or chain of custody.\r\n\r\nAssociated Analyses and Documentation: All investigative reports, intelligence summaries, or briefings prepared in connection with these sightings. This includes assessments of their origin, behavior, or potential significance, such as whether they posed a security, safety, or privacy threat. I also request documentation of decisions or deliberations regarding the classification, distribution, or public disclosure of information related to these events.\r\n\r\nCommunications and Directives: All internal and inter-agency communications referencing these aerial phenomena, including any correspondence that references \"mystery drones,\" UAP, or similar terms. This includes records of communications with external entities, such as contractors, private organizations, foreign governments or international bodies, and federal, state, or local agencies involved in investigating or responding to these incidents.\r\n\r\nRecords of Federal Collaboration: All records documenting referrals, consultations, or information sharing with federal agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Defense (DoD), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or any other relevant entities.\r\n\r\nIf the scope of this request is deemed overly broad, I am willing to work with your office to refine it to ensure the timely identification and release of responsive records. I also request that responsive records be provided in their original electronic format, preserving all metadata.\r\n\r\nIf any portions of the requested records are exempt under public records laws, I request that non-exempt portions be released. For any classified materials, I request a mandatory declassification review under applicable laws, including Executive Order 13526.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
