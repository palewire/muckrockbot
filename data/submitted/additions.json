If a separate record identifies the anticipated or actual amount of time the person spends on their duties (i.e., identifying how much of their time is spent on a given subject), please provide that record, as well.\r\n\r\n3. Any record sufficient to show the salary of any person (whether employed by the city or any departments thereof) whose primary responsibilities include responding to or managing public records requests.\r\n\r\n4. If the city maintains a log of public records requests, please provide a copy of the log dating back to January 1, 2022.\r\n\r\nRequests 1-3 are limited to documents generated during or concerning the last fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",
