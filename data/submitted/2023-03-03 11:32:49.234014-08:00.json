All emails to/from/between Dr. Anthony Fauci and any email address originating from, or ending in, \" @mckinsey.com \" between the dates of 1/1/2020 and 1/31/2021. Please make sure to include all attachments to those emails. When providing the responsive records related to this request, please specifically certify that no other responsive documents related to this request exist.\r\n\r\nIf it is not possible for your agency to conduct a search for emails originating from a specific domain, such as @mckinsey.com, please let me know and I can provide you with a specific list of McKinsey email addresses to search for instead.\r\n\r\nBetween 4/28/2020 and 1/31/2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded $13 million to McKinsey and Company, the details of which are available here: https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75R60220P00009_7526_-NONE-_-NONE-\r\n\r\nFully understanding if, and/or how, high-ranking government public health officials like Dr. Fauci communicated with non-government consultants when shaping the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the information that was shared during the public policy-making process, is of the highest importance to the public interest. Given the impact of COVID-19 and its related policies on the United States, and on global society more generally, the requested records have deep historical significance and undeniably hold a high level of importance to the public interest. Because of that, the requested records should be made available to the public with as few redactions as possible, at the lowest fee possible, and as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested information will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and/or activities of the government during a historic public health crisis and is not primarily in my commercial interest.\r\n\r\nIn order to help determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am a freelance journalist whose work has been published by print and digital news outlets and magazines at the national, regional and local levels. You can view my portfolio at www.erinmariemiller.com/clips. I have previously been determined a media requester by federal agencies under other FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the media, I request a waiver of all fees. In the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $25 for the requested information. If the fee for this request exceeds this amount, please notify me in writing for permission prior to beginning work on the request.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nPlease send all documents related to this request to this email address.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Marie Miller",

In addition, the FDNS Directorate is responsible for detecting, deterring, and combating immigration benefit fraud, hence the creation of the FDNS Data System (FDNS-DS). FDNS-DS NexGen is a case management system, that is planning to use resolved artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) entities from other applications to aid in investigative work, enhance investigative case prioritization, and detect duplicate case work. In the future, there are plans to integrate AI/ML into the predictive modeling for future system enhancements, working side-by-side with the business stakeholders to develop best practices. Fraud occurs in numerous ways; being able to discover and detect persons with multiple identities allows for more comprehensive investigations, reduces investigative cycle time, and improves performance.\"\r\n\r\nYou can find more about this program here: https://www.dhs.gov/data/AI_inventory\r\n\r\nI am interested in responsive records between 1/1/22-12/28/22.
