Specifically, I am requesting the following information:\r\n\r\nRecords of all requests made by law enforcement agencies for surplus military equipment, including the types of equipment requested and the justification for the request.\r\nRecords of all equipment distributed to law enforcement agencies under the 1033 Program and the Homeland Security Grant Program, including the types of equipment distributed, the quantity, and the receiving agencies.\r\nPolicies and procedures governing the distribution of surplus military equipment to law enforcement agencies, as well as any relevant guidance or training materials.\r\nRecords of any incidents involving the use of surplus military equipment by law enforcement agencies, including any investigations, disciplinary actions, or reports.\r\nI request that any responsive records be provided to me without redactions or withholdings, except in cases where redactions or withholdings are required by law. Please note that the FOIA requires that any redactions or withholdings be limited to only the specific information that is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA, and that the agency must provide a justification for any such redactions or withholdings.\r\n\r\nI also note that the FOIA requires agencies to provide the requested information in a timely manner. If the requested information is not provided within 20 business days, I reserve the right to pursue all legal remedies available to me.\r\n\r\nTo support my FOIA request, I would like to reference the case law of Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1113 (D.C. Cir. 2004), which holds that \u201cgovernmental agencies bear the burden of showing that requested documents are exempt from disclosure under FOIA.\u201d I would also like to reference the case law of Martin v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 488 F. Supp. 2d 443, 454 (D.D.C. 2007), which holds that \u201cFOIA exemptions are to be narrowly construed, with any doubts resolved in favor of disclosure.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

Because when it comes to driving, it's not just about getting from point A to point B, it's about feeling the family connection (if you know what I mean).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting all documents, emails, and memos related to the processing time of driver's license applications and registration documents for the past five years. Because when you're part of the family, you want to make sure that everyone is taken care of (even if it means waiting in line for what feels like forever).\r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to request any statistics or reports on the number of people who have fallen asleep while waiting in line at any of the NY DMV offices during the past five years. Because we all know that sometimes, waiting in line can feel like spending quality time with your second cousin twice removed (you know, the one who always falls asleep at family gatherings).\r\n\r\nIf possible, please include any information on the measures taken by the DMV to address long wait times and to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals waiting in line. Because we're all part of the same family here, and we want to make sure that everyone is treated with respect and care.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand the importance of efficiency and accuracy in processing these requests, I couldn't help but wonder if any of your employees have ever felt the need for speed, so to speak. Any reports or records related to any high-speed pursuits, street racing incidents, or other dangerous activities involving DMV employees would be greatly appreciated (but we won't tell anyone, because family always sticks together).\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your response\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or destroyed, I reserve the right to file a complaint and take legal action to compel the release of these records.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer you to the following court cases:\r\n\r\nFederal Open Market Committee v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340 (1979): Agencies cannot withhold records under FOIA merely because they consider them confidential. The agency must show that the information is actually exempt under one of the nine statutory exemptions.\r\nFBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615 (1982): Agencies cannot rely on a \"mosaic theory\" of withholding, where they argue that release of some information, in combination with other publicly available information, would reveal sensitive information.\r\nWashington Post Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252 (D.C. Cir. 1982): Agencies cannot withhold documents simply because they contain both exempt and non-exempt material. Rather, the agency must segregate and release the non-exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Specifically, I am requesting documents related to surveillance of the protest and any other relevant documents.\r\n\r\n***Please read this request carefully. Failure to comply with the request or provide all responsive records in a timely manner may result in legal action, including filing a complaint with the Civilian Complaint Review Board and the Mayor's Office, as well as seeking relief in court to compel the production of the responsive records.***\r\n\r\nThe Occupy Wall Street protests took place at various locations throughout New York City, including but not limited to Zuccotti Park (located in the Financial District), Foley Square (located in Lower Manhattan), Union Square (located in the East Village), Washington Square Park (located in Greenwich Village), Tompkins Square Park (located in the East Village), Bryant Park (located in Midtown Manhattan), City Hall Park (located in Lower Manhattan), Columbus Circle (located at the southwest corner of Central Park), Brooklyn Bridge (a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn), Times Square (located in Midtown Manhattan), and Grand Central Terminal (located in Midtown Manhattan).\r\n\r\nDuring this time, there were reports of excessive police force and other misconduct towards protestors by NYPD officers. As such, I request access to any and all records related to surveillance of the protests at these locations, including but not limited to, intelligence gathering, information sharing with other law enforcement agencies, and reports on any protest-related incidents. Additionally, I request documents related to the following specific events that took place at these locations:\r\n\r\nZuccotti Park: The initial encampment and general assembly of the Occupy Wall Street movement.\r\nFoley Square: The October 1, 2011, march and rally led by labor unions and community groups in support of Occupy Wall Street.\r\nUnion Square: The September 24, 2011, rally that was one of the largest protests during the Occupy Wall Street movement.\r\nWashington Square Park: The October 8, 2011, student-led rally in support of Occupy Wall Street.\r\nTompkins Square Park: The October 22, 2011, Occupy Halloween march and rally.\r\nBryant Park: The November 3, 2011, Bank Transfer Day protest.\r\nCity Hall Park: The November 15, 2011, eviction of the Occupy Wall Street encampment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am requesting access to any other relevant documents, including but not limited to, communications between NYPD personnel or with other agencies, memos, policies, procedures, training materials, and guidelines related to the surveillance of the protests. This request includes records that may have been generated by interagency collaboration or cooperation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I request any video footage that may have been taken by NYPD Community Affairs officers during the Occupy Wall Street protests. Furthermore, I request access to any complaints filed against NYPD officers during the Occupy Wall Street protests that are related to their conduct towards protestors.\r\n\r\nI understand that locating responsive records may require the use of certain keywords and phrases. Therefore, I suggest that the following key strings be used in the search for responsive records:\r\n\r\nOccupy Wall Street\r\nOWS\r\nZuccotti Park\r\nFoley Square\r\nUnion Square\r\nWashington Square Park\r\nTompkins Square Park\r\nBryant Park\r\nCity Hall Park\r\nColumbus Circle\r\nBrooklyn Bridge\r\nTimes Square\r\nGrand Central Terminal\r\nCommunity Affairs\r\nComplaints\r\nSurveillance\r\nIntelligence gathering\r\nInformation sharing\r\nReports\r\nMemos\r\nPolicies\r\nProcedures\r\nTraining materials\r\nGuidelines\r\nI request that all responsive records be provided without redactions or deletions, unless a specific legal exemption applies. If records are withheld or redacted, I request that the basis for withholding or redaction be clearly stated, and that any segregable portions of the records be released.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request that the responsive documents be provided to me on a rolling basis as they become available, rather than waiting until all records have been compiled. This will enable me to more quickly review and analyze the records, as well as identify any additional documents that may be necessary to request.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIL mandates that records be provided to the public, and withholding or redacting responsive records may only be done under specific legal exemptions. If any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or deleted, please provide the legal justification for doing so. Failure to comply with this request may result in legal action, including filing a complaint with the Civilian Complaint Review Board and the Mayor's Office, as well as seeking relief in court to compel the production of the responsive records.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to cite the following court cases and local laws to support my FOIA request:\r\n\r\nMatter of New York Times Co. v. City of New York, 735 N.Y.S.2d 380 (Sup. Ct. 2001)\r\nMatter of Daily News, L.P. v. New York City Police Dept., 15 N.Y.3d 385, 911 N.E.2d 1140 (2010)\r\nMatter of Murray v. City of New York, 107 A.D.3d 785, 967 N.Y.S.2d 462 (2d Dep't 2013)\r\nNew York Public Officers Law, Article 6\r\n\r\nThese cases and laws establish that FOIL requires government agencies to provide requested records unless they fall under specific exemptions, and that the exemptions must be narrowly construed. Therefore, I urge the NYPD to comply with my FOIA request and provide all responsive records in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRequest access to any and all records related to the WWE plane incident and investigation into it, which occurred on May 5, 2002. The incident involved several wrestlers and staff members of the WWE who were traveling on a chartered flight from London to the United States.\r\n\r\nAs you may be aware, the incident became chaotic and resulted in allegations of sexual assault, harassment, and other inappropriate behavior. These allegations were made public in a recent \"Dark Side of the Ring\" documentary by Vice, which has raised serious concerns about the safety and well-being of those involved. I have attached a copy of this article to this request for your reference.\r\n\r\nAs a concerned citizen and journalist, I believe it is important to understand the full extent of this incident and any related investigations that may have taken place. Therefore, I request access to any and all records related to this incident, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\nAny FBI investigation or inquiry into the incident\r\nWitness statements and interviews conducted by the FBI or other law enforcement agencies\r\nCorrespondence between the FBI and the WWE or its employees regarding the incident\r\nAny reports or memoranda created as a result of the investigation\r\nAny other documents or information related to the incident or any subsequent investigations\r\nAny other incidents involving the WWE/WWF and allegations of sexual misconduct or inappropriate behavior\r\nAny other investigations conducted by the FBI into the WWE/WWF or its employees\r\nIn addition, I request that the FBI conduct an interagency search for any records that may be in the possession of other government agencies, such as the Department of Justice or the Department of Transportation.\r\n\r\nI advise the FBI not to delete, redact, or withhold any responsive records. If any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or destroyed, I reserve the right to file a complaint and take legal action to compel the release of these records.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer you to the following court cases:\r\n\r\nFederal Open Market Committee v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340 (1979): Agencies cannot withhold records under FOIA merely because they consider them confidential. The agency must show that the information is actually exempt under one of the nine statutory exemptions.\r\nFBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615 (1982): Agencies cannot rely on a \"mosaic theory\" of withholding, where they argue that release of some information, in combination with other publicly available information, would reveal sensitive information.\r\nWashington Post Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252 (D.C. Cir. 1982): Agencies cannot withhold documents simply because they contain both exempt and non-exempt material. Rather, the agency must segregate and release the non-exempt material.\r\nFurthermore, I request that any redactions made to the records be kept to a minimum and that any exemptions claimed by the FBI be explained in detail.\r\n\r\nTo help facilitate the search for these records, I provide the following keystring search terms:\r\n\r\nWWE plane incident\r\nFlight from Hell\r\nSexual assault allegations WWE\r\nFBI investigation WWE\r\nWWE misconduct investigation\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

Massengill, who was charged with setting fire to a Planned Parenthood clinic in Illinois, as reported in the article referenced here: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/illinois-man-charged-setting-fire-planned-parenthood.\r\n\r\nIn order to assist with locating the records, I request that a search be conducted for all records related to Tyler W. Massengill and any associated individuals or organizations involved in the incident. I further request that this search be conducted across all relevant offices, divisions, and agencies, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) indices.\r\n\r\nTo narrow the scope of the search, I request that the following key strings be used in the search for responsive records: \"Tyler W. Massengill\", \"Planned Parenthood\", and \"fire\". I also request that this search be conducted for records from January 1, 2021 to the date this request is processed.\r\n\r\nI request that all responsive records be provided in their entirety, without redaction or deletion, unless such redaction or deletion is necessary to protect classified information, personal privacy, or other legally protected interests. Please note that any such redaction or deletion will be subject to challenge and may be compelled in court.\r\n\r\nFinally, I request that this request be expedited due to the nature of the information sought and the public interest in disclosure. As a reference for expedited processing, I cite the case of American Civil Liberties Union v. FBI, 710 F.3d 422 (2013), which held that a delay in the release of information pertaining to government activity that is already in the public domain can result in a lack of trust in government officials, thereby hindering their ability to carry out their duties.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request an interagency search for responsive records, including any records that may be held by other agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\r\n\r\nTo assist in the search, I would like to request that the following key strings be used to identify potentially responsive records:\r\n\r\nTyler W. Massengill\r\nPlanned Parenthood arson\r\nIllinois\r\nI also request any Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) records, including but not limited to wiretaps, surveillance logs, and monitoring reports related to Tyler W. Massengill or the Planned Parenthood arson case.\r\n\r\nTo support this request, I would like to reference the article from the Department of Justice (DOJ) website titled \"Illinois Man Charged with Setting Fire to Planned Parenthood\". The article states that Tyler W. Massengill was charged with damaging and destroying a Planned Parenthood facility by means of fire on October 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to cite the following case law to support this FOIA request:\r\n\r\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Department of Defense, 628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011)\r\nNation Magazine v. United States Customs Service, 71 F.3d 885 (D.C. Cir. 1995)\r\nI request that this FOIA request be expedited due to the urgency and importance of the information sought. If any records are withheld, redacted, or deleted, I request a detailed explanation for each instance and the specific FOIA exemption(s) under which the information was withheld.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to remind you that any responsive records that are not provided will be subject to compulsory production in court. I look forward to your timely response and please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRelated to death of Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza, as outlined in the ICE document titled \"Detainee Death Review (DDR) Report: Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza\" (document available at https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrMendozaMelvinArielCalero.pdf).\r\n\r\nAs context, recent reports indicate that there have been a significant number of deaths in ICE custody in recent years, and the public has a strong interest in understanding the circumstances surrounding these deaths and any legal action that may have resulted.\r\n\r\nIn support of this FOIA request, I would like to cite the following court case:\r\n\r\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 666 F. Supp. 2d 41 (D.D.C. 2009)\r\nIn this case, the court ruled that agencies must provide a \"reasonably detailed\" explanation for any redactions or withholdings of records requested under FOIA, and that such redactions or withholdings may not be made \"categorically or through conclusory assertions.\"\r\n\r\nPlease note that any unjustified withholding, redaction, or deletion of records requested in this FOIA request will be subject to legal action to compel disclosure. Additionally, any complaint filed with the appropriate court or administrative body will seek reimbursement of legal costs and fees.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting any and all records, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\nAny additional reports, investigations, or documents related to the death of Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza not included in the aforementioned DDR report;\r\nAny correspondence, including but not limited to emails, letters, or memoranda, related to the death of Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza;\r\nAny medical records or reports related to the care and treatment provided to Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza while in ICE custody;\r\nAny policies, procedures, or guidelines related to the care and treatment of detainees in ICE custody, specifically those related to medical care;\r\nAny video footage or photographs related to the death of Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza, including footage from surveillance cameras or body-worn cameras worn by ICE personnel;\r\nA list of all ICE employees who interacted with Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza from the time of his detention until his passing, including but not limited to officers, medical personnel, and administrative staff.\r\nTo help narrow the scope of this request, I am specifically interested in records from the time of Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza's detention until his passing.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

This includes information on the development and implementation of such algorithms, as well as any internal communications regarding their effectiveness and security.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting access to all responsive documents and programs related to the use of cryptographic algorithms, including but not limited to metadata collection programs like XKeyscore, and any other related programs or tools.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to reference several articles that discuss the importance of transparency and accountability in the use of cryptographic algorithms by government agencies, including the NSA. These articles are attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nI am also interested in any information related to Type 1-4 product types, as defined by the National Security Agency/Central Security Service Information Assurance Directorate (NSA/CSS IAD) Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) Program. This may include information on the implementation and use of cryptographic algorithms in Type 1-4 products, as well as any internal communications or reports regarding their security and effectiveness.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the development, implementation, and effectiveness of these algorithms is crucial to ensuring that they are being used in a responsible and lawful manner. As a result, I believe that this request falls within the purview of the FOIA and that the NSA has a duty to provide access to these records in the interest of transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nI request that all responsive documents be provided in their entirety, without redaction or withholding, except in cases where the NSA can provide a specific justification for why the records are exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Please note that any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records without providing a specific justification may result in a complaint and legal action to compel the NSA to provide access to the requested records in accordance with the FOIA.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
