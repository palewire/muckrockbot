We are still consulting with the staff regarding potentially responsive records relating to your FOIA request.  Once we receive a response from the SEC staff, our office will continue to process your request as expeditiously as possible.  Due to the unforeseen delays, the new estimated completion date (ECD) is December 31, 2023.  This new ECD is to ensure that the agency\u2019s search of records is accurate, and if records are located, sufficient time to review them for responsiveness.  We do sincerely apologize for the unusually long delays.  You may continue to contact me during the interim.\r\n\nKindest Regards,\r\n\r\n      Alysia Morrow\r\nFOIA Research Specialist\r\nOffice of FOIA Services\r\n\r\nOFFICE                 +1 202 551 8376\r\namorrowa@sec.gov<mailto:amorrowa@sec.gov>\r\n\r\n[Title: SEC logo]",

        "communication": "Kinda, yeah, but not exactly.\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting you run the search again but only with that parameter returning larger files, with the intent of seeing how many files are of the kind that might fit the \"1 GB of data can contain anywhere from 16,000 individual pages to over 60,000 pages\" estimate. Using size:1048568..1074000000 returns all the results that are between about a megabyte and a gigabyte. I'm making an educated guess that a very small number of files are responsible for the majority of the on disk space.\r\n\r\nI suspect that some files are very large on disk (like powerpoints with uncompressed images), but have very few pages that need to be reviewed. As an example, a scientist colleague of mine once had a powerpoint presentation that was more than a gigabyte in size, with something like only 50 slides. She'd included some videos that had never been compressed, which drastically inflated the file size.\r\n\r\nI do not know exactly what features the city pays for (the licensing agreement with Microsoft is the subject of another ongoing FOIL request of mine!), but one possible option is you may be able to export a report to see more information about the documents the search returns:\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ediscovery-export-a-content-search-report\r\n\r\nAn alternative that I provided was to simply download a copy of the larger search results and spot check them to see if there are just a few files that account for the majority of the on-disk space. That's very easy with some common free software, but if you wish to do it manually, increasing the parameter to something like size:52430000..1074000000 should reduce the volume of files even further.\r\n\r\nI'd expect that using size:1048568..1074000000 might return several hundred files, and size:52430000..1074000000 might return a few dozen. If you run the 50 MB-1GB search and the size of the responsive records are like 10GB, that means we've found the culprit! And I can ask you to either review the number of pages in that files when estimating the voluminousness of the request as a whole. If it's just a few powerpoints, neither of us have to worry about days  spent redacting 16,000 pages, it may only be a hundred.",

        "communication": "Hello there, we are approaching three missed agency-proposed records production dates. Will the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date/deadline most recently proposed by the agency be met?\r\n\r\nI would like to assume the agency is being forthright with me about meeting a date they propose, and have no knowledge of anything that they might be able to reasonably foresee preventing them from producing the requested and agreed upon records. I struggle to fathom how a pre-existing and ongoing backlog could surprise anybody by causing delays in records production - some agencies have abused this with me in a downright rude manner to delay requests more than a dozen times. \r\n\r\nI have no personal animus with any individual employed by the department - in a likely understaffed role - who is following routine agency procedures, and I presume they have no issue with me. We're all working with unfair systems run by people we have no contact with! Indeed, the records access officer I dealt with earlier was exceptionally helpful and more technically competent than the majority of records access officers that I've interacted with.\r\n\r\nOver the years I have learned that such agency-proposed records production dates are more often missed than met, and it's no more likely the agency will meet the next date they propose than the one they've missed. On muckrock, this agency is a bit better than the average NYC agency, and returns records with an average of 113 days, so we're just on the edge of meeting this date! That's good news - I just want to rely on something better than crossed fingers.\r\n\r\nI am pre-emptively appealing on grounds of constructive denial of records. I am asking the agency to provide guarantees that the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date/deadline most recently proposed by the agency will be met, and if it cannot be met under current circumstances, that the agency shall either provide a date for which they will provide such records absent circumstances a reasonable person cannot reasonably forsee delaying production of records, or assign sufficient staff to meet the agency proposed records production date. \r\n\r\nI look forward to this appeal being moot upon production of records by the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date.",

Inspector Tony Robles noted that on May 9, 2024, he went to the Baltimore and spoke with the complaining tenant, and took photos.  Please provide all of those notes, documents, photos or videos.\r\n3. All communications regarding the February 2022 inspection by Tony Robles of the Baltimore, during which he noted over 100 violations for lack of deadbolts, but James Heiberg said to delete those violations. \r\n4. All communications between anyone from Code Enforcement and anyone at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, regarding the deadbolts at the Baltimore.  This is including but not limited to the text messages and emails that Robert Gilardi kindly sends to Mark Dyer rather than issuing a Notice to Comply. This includes communications between Code Enforcement on the one hand, and on the other hand,  AHF's: Mark Dyer, Michael Weinstein, Jonathan Eisenberg, Tom Myers, Conrad Sison, Beatrice Di Marco, Dominique Eastman, Herbert Ellis,  Juan Larios.\r\n5. Any discussion (including emails, text messages, memos, notes) between any Code Enforcement employee, (including but not limited to James Heiberg, Robert Gilardi, Tony Robles, Ann Sewill, etc.), that includes any of the following terms: \"1941.3\" \"deadbolt\" \"dead bolt\" \"91.8607\" \"door lock\" \"91.8607\" and/or \"897099.\" \r\n6. Any discussion between any Code Enforcement employee, about why it decided to exclude the exact complaint language from the publicly accessible Property Activity Report on complaint #897099.\r\n7. Any emails with the subject line \"Complaint # 897099 / Baltimore Hotel / Carlos Brum/ Lack of Deadbolts\"\r\n\r\nThis public records act request is not limited to the custodian of records simply forwarding this request to the named individuals here. This request demands that the custodian of records actually contact its IT department and conduct a search with the specific parameters and search terms. This request demands electronic copies of these records in their native format, and not printed out and scanned.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnnette Morasch",

As just one example, the email from Mark Dyer to the City dated 2/12/2024 has several attachments which were not produced. (See attached.) None of the emails which show they have attachments were produced with the attachments. \r\nThese records also do not include any of the following requested documents:\r\n\r\n2. Inspector Tony Robles noted that on May 9, 2024, he went to the Baltimore and spoke with the complaining tenant, and took photos. Please provide all of those notes, documents, photos or videos.\r\n3. All communications regarding the February 2022 inspection by Tony Robles of the Baltimore, during which he noted over 100 violations for lack of deadbolts, but James Heiberg said to delete those violations.\r\n4. All communications between anyone from Code Enforcement and anyone at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, regarding the deadbolts at the Baltimore. This is including but not limited to the text messages and emails that Robert Gilardi kindly sends to Mark Dyer rather than issuing a Notice to Comply. This includes communications between Code Enforcement on the one hand, and on the other hand, AHF's: Mark Dyer, Michael Weinstein, Jonathan Eisenberg, Tom Myers, Conrad Sison, Beatrice Di Marco, Dominique Eastman, Herbert Ellis, Juan Larios.\r\n5. Any discussion (including emails, text messages, memos, notes) between any Code Enforcement employee, (including but not limited to James Heiberg, Robert Gilardi, Tony Robles, Ann Sewill, etc.), that includes any of the following terms: \"1941.3\" \"deadbolt\" \"dead bolt\" \"91.8607\" \"door lock\" \"91.8607\" and/or \"897099.\"\r\n\r\nDocuments have been redacted without reason. I understand why you woudl redact tenant contact information (which you did for some, but not others). But there are whole chunks of communications redacted without saying who was involved in the redacted communication. Thus the majority of my requests were ignored by the  City. \r\n\r\nConclusion. If I do not receive a fully compliant response to my PRA, we will file a writ of mandate and seek attorneys' fees on August 19, 2024.",

Provide a blank template letter for the 5 day unexcused absence letter; \r\n2. Provide a blank template letter for the 10 day unexcused absence letter; RESPONSE: Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\n3. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 5 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024; \r\n4. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 10 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024. RESPONSE: The CPS FOIA Office has reviewed your request with the CPS Office of Student Support and Engagement and the CPS School Administration & Health Services Team and has been advised that the information you seek is not comprehensively tracked centrally in the regular course of business. Be advised that while there is a system in place that advises schools of students who have had 5-day and 10-day unexcused absences, the correspondence that is to be sent out to parents is the responsibility of individual schools. As such, this information is not centrally tracked or can be counted. In order to provide you with information responsive to your request, a FOIA Officer would have to go to each school to conduct a search and create a new record which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. Specifically, creating records and answering questions is not required according to guidance provided by 5 ILCS 140/2(c). 5 ILCS 140/1, Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28, 32 (4 th Dist. 1989), and Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Additionally, under Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Further, section 1 of FOIA states in part: \u201cThis Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\u201d In accordance with Section 1 of the Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer your questions or prepare researched records on your behalf in response to your request. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Ana Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

There is no obligation for us to continue producing records that are not being collected by a requester. \r\nRCW 42.56.120(4) states that if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. \r\nWAC 44-14-04006(1) states that a records request has been fulfilled and can be closed if an entirely unclear request has not been clarified, a request or installment has not been claimed or reviewed, or the requestor cancels the request.

A copy of all guidelines, protocols, training materials, educational materials, and screening or diagnostic materials used by the university\u2019s athletics department related to the prevention of disordered eating, identification of student-athletes at risk of developing disordered eating, and establishing a chain of reporting for a student-athlete flagged as at risk for developing or exhibiting symptoms of disordered eating. Relevant keywords to this records search include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, relative energy deficiency, low energy availability, RED-S, and disordered eating.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees because I am a reporter for a widely read news site, Business Insider, and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of American universities\u2019 procedures for assisting student-athletes at risk of developing eating disorders. \r\n\r\nIn conducting your search, please use the most recent technologies and tools available. \r\n\r\nIf any part of our request is determined by your organization to be exempt from disclosure, please release any segregable non-exempt portions. If your organization determines that such segregation is impossible, please indicate why this is technically the case. If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the Georgia Open Records Act \u00a7 50.18.70 et seq.,. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees. \r\nPlease produce these records in the electronic format and share them with me via email at nparakul@insider.com, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHannah Beckler",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThank you for your message. I submitted my request via MuckRock on January 10 2024. Below is a copy of the original request language:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Georgia Open Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. A copy of all guidelines, protocols, training materials, educational materials, and screening or diagnostic materials used by the university\u2019s athletics department related to the prevention of disordered eating, identification of student-athletes at risk of developing disordered eating, and establishing a chain of reporting for a student-athlete flagged as at risk for developing or exhibiting symptoms of disordered eating. Relevant keywords to this records search include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, relative energy deficiency, low energy availability, RED-S, and disordered eating.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees because I am a reporter for a widely read news site, Business Insider, and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of American universities\u2019 procedures for assisting student-athletes at risk of developing eating disorders.\r\n\r\nIn conducting your search, please use the most recent technologies and tools available.\r\n\r\nIf any part of our request is determined by your organization to be exempt from disclosure, please release any segregable non-exempt portions. If your organization determines that such segregation is impossible, please indicate why this is technically the case. If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the Georgia Open Records Act \u00a7 50.18.70 et seq.,. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees.\r\nPlease produce these records in the electronic format and share them with me via email at nparakul@insider.com, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nNarimes Parakul",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Galante,\r\n\r\nThis is in reference to your FOIPA request # 1433170-000 for FBI records concerning 065-HQ-57411. We are reaching out to you to determine if you are still interested in these records, or, if at this time, you would consider reducing the size of your request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis. Requests are divided into two primary tracks -simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents). Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-500 pages), large (501-4,999 pages), and extra-large (5,000 and over pages) sub-tracks are based upon request size.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the large track and reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us with regards to this inquiry to let us know if you are still interested in receiving records for this request either in full (the remaining records), or reducing the request to a faster processing track.\r\nIf you reduce the size, you may request remaining, additional records by submitting a new FOIPA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<http://www.fbi.gov/foia> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DA2456.D092CD00][Logo, company name  Description automatically generated]",

Small track requests (0-50 pages) current average time is approximately 4 months to complete; Medium track requests (51-500 pages) current average time is approximately 41 months to complete; Large track requests (501-4,999 pages) current average time is approximately 67 months to complete; and Extra-large track requests (over 5,000 pages) current average time is approximately 79 months to complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<http://www.fbi.gov/foia> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DA3E3A.AEF77850][Logo, company name  Description automatically generated]",

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington.

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via email reply.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nDO NOT DELAY PRODUCTION OR DELIVERY OF REQUESTED PUBLIC RECORDS IN BAD FAITH\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-04003 (8) An agency can only seek a clarification when the request is objectively \"unclear.\" Seeking a \"clarification\" of an objectively clear request delays access to public records.\r\n\r\nDo not delay production of copies of records responsive to this public records request by sending emails seeking redundant \"confirmation\" the requestor still wants the records originally requested. This request should remain open and production of copies of responsive public records requested should continue until complete. The requestor WANTS COPIES OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTED.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nDO NOT DELAY PRODUCTION OR DELIVERY OF REQUESTED PUBLIC RECORDS IN BAD FAITH\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-04003 (8) An agency can only seek a clarification when the request is objectively \"unclear.\" Seeking a \"clarification\" of an objectively clear request delays access to public records.\r\n\r\nDo not delay production of copies of records responsive to this public records request by sending emails seeking redundant \"confirmation\" the requestor still wants the records originally requested. This request should remain open and production of copies of responsive public records requested should continue until complete. The requestor WANTS COPIES OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTED.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fcity-of-tacoma-24283%252Fcity-of-tacoma-public-disclosure-analyst-lisa-anderson-public-employee-personnel-file-and-disciplinary-records-168565%252F%253Femail%253Dcitymanager%252540cityoftacoma.org&url_auth_token=AADpHRyPgY-oQVLpNlmUJat-aWk%3A1sRNAp%3AGnihOZo3elUy2CllxYWIFXjvqtTdM18uLkMJshGxozE\"I\r\n\r\nI am providing an installment of records responsive to your request labeled Installment 1.

Proof of death is not required as her death was widely reported: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/us/madeleine-albright-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

We have reviewed your request and wanted to follow up with more information, as well as to get direction from you about how you'd like to proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with state law and our policy and procedures regarding public access to University information (both linked below), there is a threshold of staff time beyond which time spent collecting and copying responsive records is charged to the requester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we are often able to search a single inbox for a select date range and keywords, conducting this search across 17 months of Dr. Urriola's inbox will put us over the threshold I mentioned above. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to proceed with this request, as currently written, we would need to collect a $100 deposit. Should the final cost be above or below this deposit total, we would follow up with you before releasing the data to detail any balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all that said, it's also our understanding that Dr. Urriola's contributions do not generally involve the communications aspects of this work. It is quite possible that, should you pay the costs associated with collecting 17 months of data, that there will be little or no responsive data at the end of that search. We won't know for certain until we conduct a search for these records, but I wanted to be upfront about that possibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in refining this search to reduce potential costs, which would primarily involve reducing the timeframe you've identified, I'd be happy to discuss that as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you'd like to proceed with this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nJake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks referenced above:\r\n\r\nhttps://policy.umn.edu/operations/publicaccess\r\n\r\nhttps://policy.umn.edu/operations/publicaccess-proc01\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at University of Minnesota.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free. See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39. If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.

The Normal track is for requests that can be processed in six to twenty workdays. The Complex track is for requests that can be processed in twenty-one to sixty workdays. The Exceptional/Voluminous track is for requests requiring more than sixty workdays for processing. The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing. Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nThis request falls into the Complex track.\r\n\r\nWe normally process requests on a first-in, first-out basis, however, due to the nature of your request and the circumstances surrounding this request, we will prioritize and process your request as the records become available. Please know that the Bureau\u2019s Management is very committed to providing responses to FOIA requests and remedying the FOIA backlog.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact us at BLM_WO_FOIA@blm.gov. Thank you for your interest in public lands and in programs and activities of the BLM.\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:30a47f1d-a3b3-47fc-bb83-7b41916a62fa]",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publish a\r\n    number of . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdocument sets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Samuel Loring Morison.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The documents were received by ATF on April 3, 2024, and this referral was assigned ATF tracking number 2024-01020.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence with this office.  For your reference, the FBI file number associated with this request is FBI FOI/PA # 1590533-000. \n\nFor your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:  simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  At this time, your request has been assigned to the Simple track.  You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. \n\nWe determined that you are a representative of the news media pursuant to 5 U.S.C. section  552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).  As such, we are required to assess fees for duplication of responsive records.  See 28 C.F.R. section 16.10(c).  You may review the Department of Justice regulations, which establish the fees charged for processing FOIA requests at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-2015-04-03/2015-07772.  If you disagree with this determination, you are welcome to provide any additional information that would demonstrate that you should not be considered a representative of the news media requester.  If you would like to discuss either the track or the fees associated with your request, please contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390.  You may also discuss any aspect of your request with our FOIA Public Liaison. \n\nSincerely, \n\nElizabeth A. Wood \nActing Chief \nInformation and Privacy Governance Division\n",

ATF received the referral on 4/3/2024.  Your request was assigned ATF tracking number 2024-01020.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence.   For your reference, the FBI file number associated with this request is 1590533-000. \r\n\r\nWe reviewed the 3 pages that the FBI sent us.  Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld.  Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \r\n\r\nWe are withholding third party information, including the names of ATF employees under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C).  To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the persons whose information you requested.  Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.  The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6).\u00a0 Exemption 7(C) permits the withholding of information compiled for law enforcement purposes that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d\u00a0 The public interest in disclosure is limited to the FOIA\u2019s core purpose of shedding light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties.\u00a0 The public interest under Exemption 7(C) must be both significant and compelling in order to overcome the legitimate personal privacy interests of a third party.\u00a0 In this matter, the disclosure would not serve the core purpose of the FOIA, but rather, would serve as an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). \r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390, for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.

I am appealing that  amended fee estimate. \r\n\r\nI believe I qualify as an educational and/or media requester, and for that reason the fees should be waived. My initial request did not specify my status. I am a journalism professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, and this request was part of a public records class I teach. I will use this request, the appeal and communications related to it, and any documents obtained, in teaching that class. The records obtained will likely be used as part of public interest news media reporting--by students or other professional news media--on the USPS decision to move mail processing from Reno, NV to Sacramento, CA. I may also use this request and communications related to it in my academic research on public records. \r\n\r\nAs evidence of my status as an educational and/or media requester, you can view my professional bio and profile here: https://www.unr.edu/journalism/faculty-and-staff/directory/file-patrick. A description of the course I teach is here: https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2019/rsj-public-records-course.

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to \"Filegate\", which arose in June 1996 around improper White House access in 1993 and 1994 to Federal Bureau of Investigation security-clearance documents. Access to the files, allegedly without permission, was given to Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security, with estimates ranging from 400 to 900 unauthorized file disclosures.\r\n\r\nI request that processing be expedited, as there is widespread interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence. This is especially relevant given the upcoming election, in which Hillary Clinton (suspected by some of wrongdoing in 'Filegate') is a candidate. I certify that my statements concerning the need for expedited processing are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I request that fees be waived, as the documents will be used to facilitate news stories which enhance the public's understanding of the government's handling of alleged wrongdoing. The documents will also be made available through the nonprofit Internet Archive's national security collection. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nI'm contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Filegate. As you probably recall, the FBI located approximately 2893 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  I can be reached via email at rbronson@fbi.gov, or you may call me at 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nRebecca Bronson\r\nRecords Management Division\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n\r\n540-868-1695",
