THE \"CASAGRANDE DRAFT\" NATIVE FILE A copy of the native electronic file (original .doc, .docx, or .pdf format) for the document titled or known as the \"Revised Statement of Planned BusinessOperation\" authored by Attorney Dan Casagrande, which was recently located in the Health Department files regarding Hat City Ale House. A copy of the document is page 5 of the attached file and was returned in a prior FOI request on 1/5/26. This document bears my signature and was never submitted by me. Dan Casagrande presented this altered document in a discussion conference in January 2024. It was not marked for discussion or draft purposes. Who placed it in the file is unknown. It's existence was discovered by me on March 13, 2024. Upon which I notified Farley Santos of the Mayors staff. Farley Santos assured me that it had been removed/destroyed on or about March 21, 2024. It currently remains in the health department folder and does not represent statements I have ever submitted to the City of Danbury.\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirement: I am specifically requesting the metadata associated with this file, including but not limited to: Date of Creation, Date of Last Modification, Authoring User, and File Path.\r\n\r\n2. FILING AND AUDIT TRAIL RECORDS All records, including emails, internal memos, or \"Records Disposal Authorizations\" (Form RC-075), that document the date this document was placed into the physical folder of the Health Department.\r\n\r\n3. 2018 INTAKE RECORDS The original 13-page \"Intake Form\" or inspection report from the 2018 initial issuance of Food Service License for Hat City Ale House. If this record has been destroyed, please provide the corresponding RC-075 form authorizing its destruction as required by the State Library\u2019s retention schedule.\r\n\r\nFormat: Per CGS \u00a7 1-212(g), I request these records in their original electronic format to preserve the integrity of the embedded metadata. Providing a scanned PDF or a paper printout of an electronic file is a \"denial of access\" to the metadata which is itself a public record.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn.

Requests are processed in the order in which they are received; please do not submit duplicate entries for the same information. You will be contacted about the availability and/or provided with copies of the records in question based on your selected preferred method of delivery. PLEASE NOTE: The Ohio Public Records Act codified in R.C. Chapter 149 does not require a governmental body to create new information or records that do not already exist or are beyond state records retention schedules. \r\n \r\nYou can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will be contacted when your request has been completed. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgain, thank you for using the Ohio Department of Public Safety - Public Records Center. Effective July 1, 2025, the Ohio State Highway Patrol will assess a fee of $38.90 per hour of video requested. This fee is the cost associated with reviewing, blurring, redacting, uploading, and producing the video records (R.C. 149.43(B)(1)). Once we receive the requested video recordings from the post, if any, an invoice shall be provided to you with the associated costs and must be paid prior to processing the videos. If an invoice is not paid within 30 days, the invoice will be cancelled and the request for videos will be closed. All other items contained in the request will still be processed and released in accordance with Ohio Public Records law regardless of whether an invoice is paid. For example, a requester who asks for body cam video, a case report, and a training record but does not pay the video invoice within 30 days will still receive the case report and training record but the video will not be processed and released. \r\nOhio Department of Public Safety",

Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, and design of the Coalie mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to DOI's decision to create a coal mascot in the first place.\r\n\r\n2. If any image of Coalie was created using AI, please produce all AI prompts that were used in the course of creating the image. Please also produce all AI image results that were generated but not ultimately used. \r\n\r\n3. Please produce all Coalie-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, videos, worksheets, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any wearable Coalie costume. Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all communications related to Coalie. This includes internal agency communications, as well as communications sent to or received from non-DOI people, agencies, or entities (public or private).\r\n\r\n6. Please produce any plans or guidelines for how the Coalie mascot will be used.\r\n\r\n7. Please produce all documents in which the Coalie mascot appears, including electronic records such as social media posts.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to and processing of this request.",
