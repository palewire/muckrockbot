I am a survivor of that attack.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 the Israeli government agreed to pay $6,000,000 for the damage to the ship.\r\n\r\nI am requesting all correspondence between the US and Israeli governments related to the payment for the damage to the USS Liberty.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoe Meadors",
