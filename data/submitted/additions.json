Such documents may include, but are not limited to, script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the FBI and the hosts and contributors of \"The Spying Game\" podcast, including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication. I request a search of all locations where such documents might be located, including but not limited to the entertainment liaison offices and communications HQ or similar offices.\r\n\r\nAttached is a document, released to me by the FBI in response to a previous FOIA request, confirming that, some time between 2019 and 2023, the FBI supported a production listed as \"The Spying Game,\" which I presume is the above-named podcast series.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",
