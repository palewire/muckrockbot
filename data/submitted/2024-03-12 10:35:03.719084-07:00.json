This includes A) any notes taken during meetings that discussed IVAS at Camp Santiago and B) any other documents related to IVAS, including internal documentation, public relations materials, after action reviews, and executive summaries.\r\n\r\n2) Any messages, communications, emails, and associated attachments shared with local, state, and federal agencies to promote \"situational awareness\" of IVAS training at Camp Santiago. These emails, messages, and associated attachments can include but are not limited to A) communications  inviting local, state, and federal agencies to participate in training exercises and B) communications letting local, state, and federal agencies know about activities taking place during the military training.\r\n\r\n3) Any internal or external organizational charts created during the lead up to the IVAS tropics test showing the command structure to be followed during the military training exercise. \r\n\r\n4) Any attendance sheets produced during the course of the IVAS tropics test at Camp Santiago.\r\n\r\n5) Any maps created during the course of the IVAS tropics test at Camp Santiago.\r\n\r\n6) Any recordings, videos, and/or images produced during the course of the IVAS tropics test at Camp Santiago. The articles mentioned above note that there is a \"detailed 'virtual playback' of the executed scenario\" created by the IVAS during testing.\r\n\r\n7) To the extent possible, any emails and associated attachments that mention IVAS testing and training at Camp Santiago.\r\n\r\nTo help limit the extent of the responsive documents, please limit search from Jan 1, 2021 through Jan 1, 2022. Please deliver these documents on a rolling basis as responsive documents are found. You can treat #7 (emails) as a separate request because I suspect there will be many more responsive documents there.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. It will be used in the course of reporting for Marea Ecologista, an independent journalism outlet. (https://mareaecologista.com/)\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was received by the Department of Technology, Management and Budget, Central Procurement Services, on March 8, 2024.  You have requested:\r\n\r\nI am seeking any agreements, documents, reports, communications, lists, logs or datasets showing the names of the state and local law enforcement agencies that have bought or can use services through the following Personal Information Database contracts: LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Contract #: 200000000664 and West Publishing Corporation, a Thomson Reuters business, Contract #: 200000000689.\r\n\r\nThe following action has been taken in response to this request:\r\n\r\nREQUEST GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST PARTIALLY GRANTED:\r\n\r\nWe have identified records believed to be responsive to your request.

The requested records are attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4(5) of the FOIA, MCL 15.234(5), provides that a public body must notify the requester in writing if all or a part of the requested information is available on the public body's website.  Please be informed that all or parts of the records you have requested are available without charge at: State of Michigan, DTMB contracts may be available free of charge at: DTMB - Contract List (michigan.gov)<https://www.michigan.gov/dtmb/procurement/contractconnect/contract-list>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST PARTIALLY DENIED:\r\n\r\n\r\nMCL 15.232(e), Records Not Possessed by DTMB\r\n\r\nTo the best of the Department's knowledge, information, and belief, DTMB does not maintain or possess public records as that term is defined under section 2(e) of the FOIA, MCL 15.232(e), under the name given in your request or by another name reasonably known to the Department, to wit, agreements, documents, reports, communications, lists, logs or datasets showing the names of the local law enforcement agencies that have bought or can use services through the following Personal Information Database contracts: LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Contract #: 200000000664 and West Publishing Corporation, a Thomson Reuters business, Contract #: 200000000689\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMCL 15.233(3)(1) Request Overly Broad\r\n\r\nMCL 15.233, Sec. 3 (1) provides that a requesting person must describe a public record sufficiently to enable the public body to find the record.
