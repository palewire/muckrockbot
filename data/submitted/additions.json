This includes any existing data compilation, including but not limited to any existing rosters of currently incarcerated people, that contains the following information: \r\n\r\n1) Name; \r\n2) ADC number; \r\n3) Admission date; \r\n4) Reason for admission; \r\n5) Current facility; and \r\n6) Projected release date. \r\n\r\nI ask that the Board provide the above records within three business days of receipt of this request, as required by Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 25-19-105(e). I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. I also ask that the Board provide me with a fee estimate prior to fulfilling any request. \r\n\r\nShould any part of the above request be denied, I request the Board provide a written response citing the specific statutory exemption, as required by Ark. Code. Ann. \u00a7 25-19-105(a)(3). If some of the above records are disclosable and others exempt, please provide the disclosable documents and provide the exemption(s) preventing disclosure of the rest per Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 25-19-105(f). If any of the above documents are administratively controlled by a different custodian than the Board, I ask that the Board please provide those custodians\u2019 information, per Ark. Code. Ann. \u00a7 25-19-105(a)(3)(C).   \r\n\r\nPlease note that I am a citizen of Arkansas, and I am using MuckRock\u2019s services to help manage and track my request.
