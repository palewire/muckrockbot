## Overview
MuckRockBot is a bot that automatically posts updates about public records requests from MuckRock to Mastodon. It keeps track of new requests being filed and completed, and shares those updates on its Mastodon account at [mastodon.palewi.re/@muckrockbot](https://mastodon.palewi.re/@muckrockbot).
