Specifically, I am seeking a dataset that includes the following information:\r\n\r\nDate and time of each traffic stop where a canine unit was employed.\r\nLocation of the traffic stop.\r\nThe reason for the traffic stop.\r\nWhether the canine unit indicated the presence of any substances, and if so, the type of substance indicated.\r\nThe outcome of the stop (e.g., warning, ticket, arrest).\r\nAny available demographic information about the driver(s) stopped.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlexander Love",
