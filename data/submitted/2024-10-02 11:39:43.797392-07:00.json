The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide copies of all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v.

Your request has been received and is being processed in accordance with the California Public Records Act. Your request was received in this office on 10/1/2024 and given the reference number N000011-100124 for tracking purposes. Records Requested: To Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nAccess to public records related to the collaboration between Fullerton College, the Fullerton Police Department (FPD), and Flying Lion, Inc. concerning the FPD\u2019s Drone First Responder (DFR) trial program.\n\nThis request is prompted by a law enforcement bulletin obtained from the Fullerton Police Department through a separate PRA request, which indicates that Fullerton College collaborated with the FPD on the DFR program. The bulletin specifically mentions that this collaboration led to the use of the call sign \"Hornets\" in honor of the Fullerton College Hornets. A copy of this bulletin is enclosed for your reference.\n\nSpecifically, I am requesting the following records:\n\n1. All communications (including but not limited to emails, letters, memos, and meeting minutes) between Fullerton College and the Fullerton Police Department related to the DFR program, including any discussion of the use of the call sign \"Hornets.\"\n\n2. Agreements, contracts, or memoranda of understanding between Fullerton College and the Fullerton Police Department and/or Flying Lion, Inc. pertaining to the DFR trial program.\n\n3. Any documents, reports, or presentations prepared by Fullerton College for or in collaboration with the Fullerton Police Department and/or Flying Lion, Inc. regarding the DFR program.\n\n4. Any internal communications or documents within Fullerton College that discuss or reference the college\u2019s involvement in or support for the FPD\u2019s DFR program.\n\nIf any records are withheld, please provide a detailed justification for each withheld record or portion thereof, including the specific exemption that you believe justifies the withholding.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAndrew Johnston\n\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fnorth-orange-county-community-college-district-35901%252Ffullerton-college-and-fullerton-police-department-dfr-program-173948%252F%253Femail%253Dkstearns%252540nocccd.edu&url_auth_token=AAGzh1ND4Gju0NG7RjeCek_vrHg%3A1svZ7m%3AEVsrDld0z-RUjiSecIuS9JXd5e1x0oekVEvSlUcO0Vg \nYour request will be forwarded to the relevant department(s) to locate the information you seek and to determine the volume and any costs associated with satisfying your request.
