        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1.\tAny internal communications (including emails, text messages, meeting notes, or memos) sent or received by any SPUSD board member, administrator, or district staff between February 3, 2025, and February 18, 2025, that reference:\r\n\t\u2022\tDeliberations over how to publicly acknowledge or respond to any incident(s) that occurred during the week of February 3\u20137;\r\n\t\u2022\tEfforts to delay, manage, or coordinate messaging to parents or the public;\r\n\t\u2022\tPreparation for the February 11, 2025 board meeting, including decisions about what would or would not be addressed publicly.\r\n2.\tAny records\u2014internal or external\u2014reflecting anticipated or actual community records requests related to that same time period.\r\n\r\nThis request is prompted by Board Member Karissa Adams\u2019s public statement during the February 11, 2025 board meeting. While participating remotely by phone, Ms. Adams stated:\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me just start by saying a real big thank you to our staff and our administration\u2026 last week we had a little bit more excitement in one week than we would like to have at the school\u2026 In this world of communication right now we need to remember that information will be dispelled as it\u2019s necessary and available, and that doesn\u2019t always mean, you know, right this second.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis statement appears to acknowledge a deliberate delay in communication with families regarding a specific incident or emergency. Notably, no other board member acknowledged the comment, and no one else referred to the incident at any point during the meeting. The session continued without clarification, follow-up, or public discussion\u2014despite the implications of the remark.\r\n\r\nFor reference, I am including a brief excerpt from the publicly available recording of the meeting:\r\nhttps://archive.org/download/spusd_02-11-2025/spusd_02-11-2025.mp4\r\n\r\nThe clip has been lightly zoomed to highlight board member reactions at the moment the comment was made. The fact that a board member raised a potentially serious issue\u2014publicly, on record\u2014and was met with complete silence, including from colleagues physically present in the room, is relevant context for this request.\r\n\r\nThis statement\u2014and the collective non-response that followed\u2014raises serious questions about what was known internally, when key decisions were made, and how communication with the public was managed at both the administrative and board level.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Rochford",

As such, we do not intend to further address this request and the PRA's one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review has started to run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you believe that there are other records in existence that should have been released to you in response to this request, please notify the Public Records Office as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant Clallam County Policy 321.17, fees for records requests shall be waived when the total fee for the request is under ten dollars. Since the total fee for this request is under ten dollars, no payment is due at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the records that are being provided to you have been redacted in part pursuant to applicable law. The redactions appear as black boxes on various pages of the responsive documents. Within the redaction box there is overlay text designating a code for the statutory exemption applicable to the redacted information. Brief explanations of the basis for the redactions are provided on the redaction log. As you review these responsive records, you can refer to the explanations listed in the redaction l to identify the exemption and its applicability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Office has attempted to apply consistent redactions on documents that contain the same information. In the event that you locate documents that contain redactions that are not applied consistently, please contact the Public Records Office. Please also contact the Public Records Office if you believe records were improperly redacted or withheld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Clallam County Administrative Policies and Procedures, any person who objects to the partial denial or redaction of a request for a Public Record may petition the Public Records Officer for a review of that decision. The petition must be in writing and include the petitioner\u2019s name and contact information.

Specific and unique terms or phrases are best or you can choose to use the + so that the first term/phrase + the second term/phrase must be in the email to be responsive (ie. \"PTSA Clubs Program\" + \"student safety\").The Department of Technology team is responsive to email/google chat pulls and all documents are reviewed to ensure that releasing them does not violate any federal or state law. \r\n**Note the district can search by groups of people (ie. HR department or legal department) but your request involves a 100+ employees. I would expect on average to each of them to conduct a search of their files for responsive documents on average would take 10 minutes (some shorter and some much longer). My recommendation would be to focus your request on those who you know have records responsive to your request and you can always submit a new request based on the documents you receive and review. Respond to this email with the details requested above. Upon receipt of clarification, the Denver Public Schools (DPS) will further respond to your public records request as required by law.\u00a0 If clarification is not received within 15 business days from the date of this email, this request will be closed.

However, based on the breakdown, it appears those paired terms were searched separately rather than together. For example, \u201cstudent\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d appear to have been run individually, which resulted in over 13,000 records\u2014definitely not the intended outcome.\r\n\r\nTo help reduce volume and return more relevant results, I\u2019d appreciate it if the attached paired terms could be searched using \u201cAND\u201d logic\u2014where both terms appear within the same document. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve also reviewed the rest of the terms and removed some of the broader ones from consideration to help keep the search more targeted. Attached is a breakdown of:\r\n\r\n- The combined search terms I\u2019d like searched using \u201cAND\u201d logic\r\n- The individual terms already searched that I\u2019d still like included in the next round\r\n- The individual terms already searched that I\u2019d like removed from the next record count and estimate\r\n\r\nOnce the updated search is complete, please let me know the revised count of unique responsive records and any associated cost estimate. I\u2019m happy to continue refining the scope if needed.\r\n\r\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if anything in the attachment needs clarification or if there\u2019s a preferred format that would make things easier on your end.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help in moving this forward.\r\nSincerely,\r\nPatrick Quigley\r\n",

These records concern internal communications within Denver Public Schools (DPS) related to two key incidents at Centennial School for Expeditionary Learning involving the Centennial PTSA and myself (Patrick Quigley): \r\n\r\n- An October 23, 2024 incident in which PTSA Committee Co-Chair Michelle Frankel yelled and used profanity toward me, a parent volunteer, on school grounds and in front of students. \r\n- A set of claims made on March 6, 2025, by PTSA Treasurer Eric Lyche, alleging that I violated policy, removed a student from the PTSA Clubs Program, and caused emotional distress to a parent. \r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, \u201ccommunications\u201d includes, but is not limited to: emails, text messages, meeting notes or summaries, records of phone or in-person conversations, chat messages (including Slack or Microsoft Teams), calendar invites, agendas, and any written or recorded documentation\u2014including internal drafts or materials created by DPS personnel for internal use. \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\r\nPlease produce all communications and records exchanged between or among the following DPS individuals or departments: \r\n\r\n- Scott Wolf, Director of Operational Services \r\n- Emily Volkert, Principal at Centennial \r\n- DPS Human Resources, including Alui Kouassi \r\n- DPS Legal or Risk Management personnel \r\n- DPS Communications personnel \r\n- Regional or instructional superintendents \r\n- Family and Community Engagement (FACE) \r\n- Volunteer Services (or department responsible for volunteer management / support) \r\n\r\n...that reference or relate to: \r\n\r\n- The October 2024 or March 2025 incidents \r\n- Any use or discussion of my name in connection with those incidents, my volunteer role, or related complaints \r\n- Internal guidance, recommendations, or direction\u2014including from Mr. Wolf to Principal Volkert\u2014regarding how to manage, respond to, or characterize either incident or any related communications involving the PTSA or me \r\n- Internal evaluations or concerns regarding my volunteer role, including reputational risk, conflict management, or parent complaints \r\n- Discussions or evaluations of DPS Board Policy KFA and its applicability to either incident \r\n- Any internal discussion or evaluation of assumed risk, liability, or legal exposure for volunteers participating in programs on DPS campuses, including whether volunteers are considered covered, protected, or personally liable under DPS policy or practice \r\n- Oversight of or internal evaluations related to the PTSA Clubs Program, including PTSA conduct, safety practices, volunteer management, policy compliance, or DPS\u2019s responsibility for incidents involving PTSA volunteers \r\n- Responses to my complaints or requests for retraction, including any internal assessment of reputational risk or incident handling \r\n\r\nPlease exclude records entirely unrelated to the individuals, incidents, or volunteer role described above (e.g., general personnel matters or unrelated school operations). \r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request yields no responsive records, I request confirmation of that outcome. If any records are withheld or redacted, please cite the specific legal exemption under \u00a7 24-72-204(3)(a), C.R.S., and provide a general description of the withheld material. \r\n\r\nIf clarification or narrowing would expedite fulfillment, please notify me at your earliest convenience. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nPatrick Quigley \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fdenver-public-schools-5864%252Fdps-internal-records-on-ptsa-incidents-centennial-oct-2024-mar-2025-186885%252F%253Femail%253Dcora%252540dpsk12.org&url_auth_token=AABOPm4MTqHlrCgJ-bwXFFls9Es%3A1uI1Bf%3A0lrZk2peXWorARE32e9arZ0PwDQwv0cjhH83i52mqIM \r\nPreviously, clarifications were requested: \r\nFor the email/google chat search portion, please provide the search terms/phrases that you believe would be in a responsive email. Specific and unique terms or phrases are best or you can choose to use the + so that the first term/phrase + the second term/phrase must be in the email to be responsive (ie. \"PTSA Clubs Program\" + \"student safety\"). \r\n\r\nThe Department of Technology team is responsive to email/google chat pulls and all documents are reviewed to ensure that releasing them does not violate any federal or state law. \r\nRespond to this email with the details requested above. \r\nUpon receipt of clarification, the Denver Public Schools (DPS) will further respond to your public records request as required by law.\u00a0 If clarification is not received within 5 business days from the date of this email, this request will be closed. \r\nFor questions or additional information, please reply to this email. \r\nSincerely, \r\nSTACY WHEELER \r\nLegal Department",

All other requested document types\u2014such as texts, meeting notes, calendar items, or internal drafts\u2014should remain under the original full scope.\r\n\r\nPlease limit the search of email and Google chat to these accounts and dates:\r\nScott Wolf: November 11 \u2013 November 22, 2024, and March 17 \u2013 May 22, 2025\r\nEmily Volkert: October 23 \u2013 November 22, 2024, and February 18 \u2013 May 22, 2025\r\nAlui Kouassi: November 4 \u2013 December 5, 2024\r\n\r\nPlease further narrow the results to include only records where at least two of the above individuals appear as sender, recipient, or CC. This should help focus the pull on internal handling and cross-departmental coordination while filtering out isolated or unrelated communications.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve also attached a revised list of keyword terms to refine the scope further. Terms are structured using Boolean logic (e.g., volunteer AND (oversight OR policy OR complaint OR risk)). If this format is incompatible with your system, please let me know the preferred syntax and I\u2019ll revise accordingly.\r\n\r\nTo reduce cost and avoid duplication, I also request that your team consolidate and deduplicate any records that appear under multiple terms, custodians, or systems. If a single record matches more than one search condition, I ask that only one copy be included in the results.\r\n\r\nIf possible, once the updated filters are applied, could your team please provide:\r\n- A revised, deduplicated record count\r\n- A brief sample (10\u201315 records) from the resulting set so I can verify relevance before proceeding with full review\r\n\r\nIf any aspect of these refinements poses a technical challenge or requires adjustment for DoTS compatibility, please let me know and I\u2019ll revise accordingly.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your work on this.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPatrick Quigley",

These records concern internal communications within Denver Public Schools (DPS) related to two key incidents at Centennial School for Expeditionary Learning involving the Centennial PTSA and myself (Patrick Quigley): \r\n\r\n- An October 23, 2024 incident in which PTSA Committee Co-Chair Michelle Frankel yelled and used profanity toward me, a parent volunteer, on school grounds and in front of students. \r\n- A set of claims made on March 6, 2025, by PTSA Treasurer Eric Lyche, alleging that I violated policy, removed a student from the PTSA Clubs Program, and caused emotional distress to a parent. \r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, \u201ccommunications\u201d includes, but is not limited to: emails, text messages, meeting notes or summaries, records of phone or in-person conversations, chat messages (including Slack or Microsoft Teams), calendar invites, agendas, and any written or recorded documentation\u2014including internal drafts or materials created by DPS personnel for internal use. \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\r\nPlease produce all communications and records exchanged between or among the following DPS individuals or departments (based on the search parameters provided by the requester): \r\n\r\n- Scott Wolf, Director of Operational Services \r\n- Emily Volkert, Principal at Centennial \r\n- DPS Human Resources, including Alui Kouassi \r\n\r\n...that reference or relate to: \r\n\r\n- The October 2024 or March 2025 incidents \r\n- Any use or discussion of my name in connection with those incidents, my volunteer role, or related complaints \r\n- Internal guidance, recommendations, or direction\u2014including from Mr. Wolf to Principal Volkert\u2014regarding how to manage, respond to, or characterize either incident or any related communications involving the PTSA or me \r\n- Internal evaluations or concerns regarding my volunteer role, including reputational risk, conflict management, or parent complaints \r\n- Discussions or evaluations of DPS Board Policy KFA and its applicability to either incident \r\n- Any internal discussion or evaluation of assumed risk, liability, or legal exposure for volunteers participating in programs on DPS campuses, including whether volunteers are considered covered, protected, or personally liable under DPS policy or practice \r\n- Oversight of or internal evaluations related to the PTSA Clubs Program, including PTSA conduct, safety practices, volunteer management, policy compliance, or DPS\u2019s responsibility for incidents involving PTSA volunteers \r\n- Responses to my complaints or requests for retraction, including any internal assessment of reputational risk or incident handling \r\n\r\nPlease exclude records entirely unrelated to the individuals, incidents, or volunteer role described above (e.g., general personnel matters or unrelated school operations). \r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request yields no responsive records, I request confirmation of that outcome. If any records are withheld or redacted, please cite the specific legal exemption under \u00a7 24-72-204(3)(a), C.R.S., and provide a general description of the withheld material. \r\n\r\nIf clarification or narrowing would expedite fulfillment, please notify me at your earliest convenience. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Ms. Wheeler,\r\nThank you for providing the responsive records and privilege log for CORA request #R000523-052225. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve reviewed the documents, privilege log, and sworn statement regarding withheld materials. After reviewing the relevant CORA statutes and consulting with the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition (CFOIC), I\u2019d like to respectfully request the following:\r\n\r\n1. Supplement to the Privilege Log\r\nUnder CORA \u00a7 24-72-204(3)(a)(XIII), the sworn statement accompanying any withheld records must:\r\n\u201cspecifically describe each document withheld, explain why each such document is privileged, and why disclosure would cause substantial injury to the public interest.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis standard was further clarified in Complete Colorado v. HCPF (Denver District Court, 2023), where the court found that general references to the \u201cdeliberative process\u201d were not enough. The agency was ordered to provide a document-by-document justification, including a clear explanation of the anticipated harm to the public interest from disclosure.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the privilege log does not include this level of detail. It generally states that disclosure of all withheld records would \u201cstifle honest and frank discussion,\u201d but does not explain how this applies to each specific document or why that harm outweighs public access in each instance. I respectfully request a supplement to the privilege log providing the specific justification required for each withheld document.\r\n\r\n2. Redacted Versions of Withheld Records\r\nWhere applicable, I request that the district release redacted versions of any withheld documents, removing only those specific portions deemed privileged or confidential. \r\n\r\nThis approach aligns with the intent of CORA and the Colorado Court of Appeals ruling in Ritter v. Jones (2009), which affirmed that partial disclosure is appropriate when a document contains both public and exempt material.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.\r\nSincerely,\r\nPatrick Quigley",

Please be advised that records are not organized or tagged according to distance from specific coordinates. Therefore, numerous records must be searched for and pulled before an additional step can be made to determine if the subject matter concerns activity within the specific geographic radiuses. We estimate that several thousands of pages of material must be pulled, with personnel spending approximately three weeks, or 120 hours on the search and compilation aspect of the response. \r\n\r\nOnce responsive records are located, and additional manual work of segregation and redaction will begin. As you may have seen or will soon see, the MBTA filed a fee petition seeking permission to charge for segregating and redacting records to the extent they contain information exempted under the Public Records Law. We currently estimate that 10-20,000 pages of material will need to be reviewed for segregation and redaction at 2 minutes per page. \r\n\r\nOnce the records are reproduced in final form, they can be transmitted to you. \r\nEstimated time to complete described work \r\n\r\nSearch and compilation time: 120.00 hours \r\n\r\nSegregation and redaction time: 500.00 hours \r\n\r\nReproduction time: 5.00 hours \r\n\r\nTotal estimated time: 625.00 hours \r\nHourly rate and estimated fee \r\n\r\nHourly rate: $25.00/hour. This hourly rate is equal to or less than the hourly rate attributed to the lowest paid employee who has the necessary skill required to search for, compile, segregate, redact or reproduce the records requested. \r\n\r\nNo fee will be assessed for the first four hours of work. Therefore, the estimated cost of complying with your request is 621 hours of chargeable work at $25.00 per hour, or $15,525.00. This amount must be paid in advance and is just an estimate, which may change when the work is actually performed. If you would like the MBTA to perform the work described above, kindly send a check in the amount of $150.00 payable to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, to my attention at 10 Park Plaza, Suite 3510, Boston, MA 02116. Additionally, we are happy to discuss an alternate scope so that records may be transmitted to you in a more efficient and affordable manner. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJulie Ciollo \r\nAssistant General Counsel/ \r\nRecords Access Officer",

Specifically, the Supervisor of Records asked that the MBTA do the following: the Authority must clarify how it requires 120 hours to search for responsive records and 5 hours to reproduce responsive records. The Authority must also provide additional information regarding the tasks necessary to produce the responsive records. You have submitted 10 broad and at times vague requests. All of your requests ask for numerous categories of records, including the following:\u00a0incident reports, arrest records, daily or monthly incident logs, and internal communications \u2014 including emails, text messages, or direct messages sent via platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Signal, Slack, or similar,\u00a0daily or monthly incident summary logs maintained by Transit Police,\u00a0internal memoranda, threat assessments, or safety alerts issued by Transit Police,\u00a0maintenance logs, service requests, or incident reports generated by MBTA Facilities, Customer Support, or contracted vendors,\u00a0memoranda, emails, correspondence, or reports originating from MBTA Legal, Risk Management, or third-party insurers that reference public safety risks, legal liability, or potential claims,\u00a0work logs, service reports, and internal or contractor-submitted records relating to sanitation, shelter maintenance, needle/biohazard removal, or encampment response,\u00a0EMS or overdose response records received, logged, or shared with MBTA Transit Police or Facilities, staff dispatch records, overdose response logs, or incident summaries from January 1, 2023 to present,\u00a0all injury logs, incident reports, union grievances, or OSHA filings made by MBTA employees or contractors concerning assaults, injuries, or unsafe working conditions,\u00a0internal communications regarding a decision not to issue a public safety bulletin, formal rider alert, or other public warning. Further, you have restricted the above categories to records related to a wide range of geographic areas. A full response will require numerous personnel across numerous MBTA departments to query databases or perform manual searches to compile potentially responsive areas. Because records are not categorized by proximity to a certain location, a manual review must take place to ensure that the subject matter matching your request comports with the chosen geographic areas. This work is compounded by the fact that you have chosen a time period of over two and a half years across every category of request. Given the numerous departments needed to engage on your requests, the dozens of categories of records, and the need for an extensive manual search to determine which records comport to the chosen geographic areas, we estimate each request may take at least 12 hours to complete the search and compilation portion of the MBTA's response. Please note that the MBTA does not permit tex messaging to be used for substantive business communications. If you wish you pursue any portion of your requests asking for text messages, please know that this is a manual search requiring an inspection of every MBTA-issued text-enabled device, of which there are hundreds if not thousands. The MBTA estimates at least 5 hours of reproduction time, which comports to 30 minutes per request. This work includes reproducing records in a redacted format once redactions have been applied, or uploading records that do not require any redaction. To the extent not already specified, the tasks needed to provide you with a full response include querying numerous databases and servers, reviewing records by hand to determine subject matter responsiveness, segregating and redacting responsive records, and reproducing records for you. Please be advised that the MBTA reserves the right to update this response or the fee estimate as the tasks involved in providing you with a response may change once the work is begun. Thank you for your attention to this matter. \r\nSincerely, \r\nJulie Ciollo Assistant General Counsel/ Records Access Officer",

Village personnel applied for the Organized Retail Crime Grant through an online portal administered by the Illinois Attorney General\u2019s Office.  We are not sure how other law enforcement agencies completed an application.  They may have prepared a paper application or have print-outs from the Attorney General\u2019s online portal.  But the Village of La Grange does not.  We cannot provide you records we do not have.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you desire to see the application materials completed in the online portal, you may want to submit a request to the Illinois Attorney General\u2019s Office.  We assume that the Attorney General\u2019s Office has copies of all information submitted.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DB9500.D12604F0]\r\n\r\nDaisy Cabrera\r\nExecutive Assistant\r\nVillage of La Grange\r\n53 S.

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords of: \r\n- Officers with authorized access to ALPR systems\r\n- Any audits that include records for the reason of the search, misuse, and how many times the ALPR search was run. \r\n- The number of times other agencies, including federal agencies, with access to the department's ALPR data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott",

I am applying a number to each of your requested items for ease of reference, as well as, providing a response in red to each item.\r\n\r\n  1.  Any risk assessments, emergency or incident response plans produced by the University of California Davis between April 20, 2024 and the time that this request is processed that mention any of the following words: \"protests,\" \"demonstrations,\" \"occupation,\" \"camp,\" \"encampment,\" \"Israel,\" \"Gaza,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Anti-semitism,\" \"Islamophobia,\" \"PULP,\" or \"Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine.\"\r\n\r\nPlease see The UC Davis Police Policy Manual found at  Police Department - UC Davis Police Policy<https://police.ucdavis.edu/professional-standards/policies> for current information regarding risk assessments, emergency or incident response plans.  I am also searching for any additional documents that may exist after publication of this manual. All information identified as responsive to your request will be reviewed, and made available for your access, in accordance with relevant law and University policy. The estimated date for production of the requested records is on or around November 11th, 2024.\r\n\r\n  1.  Any reports or logs about surveillance activities on pro-Palestine or pro-Israel student protesters on the University of California Davis campus, produced by the university, university police, or local police. These may include written reports based on CCTV camera footage, reports of relevant social media posts, plans for future surveillance, etc., between April 20, 2024 and the time that this request is processed.\r\nPlease see The UC Davis Police Policy Manual found at  Police Department - UC Davis Police Policy<https://police.ucdavis.edu/professional-standards/policies> for current information regarding social media, video, and facial recognition surveillance information.  Any student related information, if existed, would be denied pursuant to The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g).  Subsequently, they are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act (\u201cPRA\u201d), as the PRA allows the University to withhold records from disclosure where disclosure of the records is exempt or prohibited under federal or state law (Government Code \u00a7 7927.700).\r\n\r\nAs I\u2019m sure you are aware, FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of records directly pertaining to students, and generally prohibits the disclosure of such records to the public without the consent of the affected student(s).  (34 CFR 99.30 and 99.31).  In this case, the records you have requested are \u201ceducation records\u201d that contain \u201cpersonal information\u201d about a student.  (34 CFR 99.3).  The records cannot feasibly be redacted to protect the identity of the student (i.e. cannot be de-identified), and therefore can only be released with the student\u2019s consent.\r\n\r\n  1.  Any email correspondence between the University of California Office of the President (UCOP), the UC Davis Office of the Chancellor, the UC Davis Associate Chancellor/Chief of Staff, and Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs between April 20, 2024 and and the time that this request is processed, that mention the following words: \"protests,\" \"demonstrations,\" \"occupation,\" \"camp,\" \"encampment,\" \"Israel,\" \"Gaza,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Anti-semitism,\" \"Islamophobia,\" \"PULP,\" or \"Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine.\"\r\nUC has considered your request and before we can acknowledge it, we need to address the fact that it\u2019s overly broad. Even \u201ca clearly framed request\u201d may be unduly burdensome if it \u201crequires an agency to search an enormous volume of data for a \u2018needle in the haystack\u2019 or conversely, \u2026compels the production of a huge volume of material.\u201d  California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Ct. (1998) 67 Cal. App. 4th 159, 166. You have not selected custodians which is necessary to perform an email search. You have provided keywords, but this list is overly broad and will likely produce a voluminous set of records. UC Davis has responded to several public records requests related to your keywords. We will produce those records because they are the result of similar searches, and we believe they are also responsive to your request. Once you review those documents you may submit a public records request with specific information to conduct a search for potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nThe estimated date for production of these previously released records is on or around October 1st, 2024.\r\n\r\n4. Any agreements (including informal, not-signed, or draft agreements that would take place over email) or memoranda between the University of California Office of the President (UCOP), the UC Regents, the UC Davis Office of the Chancellor, the UC Davis Associate Chancellor/Chief of Staff, and UC Davis Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs between April 20, 2024 and and the time that this request is processed.\r\n\r\nA search for responsive records was conducted and it has been determined no records exist pursuant to the California Public Records Act.\r\nAt this time, items #2 and #4 are considered closed. Items #1 has an estimated date for production of on or around November 11th, 2024. Items #3 has an estimated date for production of these records is on or around October 1st, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nHeather Urzua\r\nLegal Operations Manager\r\nUC Legal \u2013 UC Davis Office of the Campus Counsel\r\nOne Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616\r\nPhone: 530-754-6295\r\nhttps://campuscounsel.ucdavis.edu/",

        "communication": "Dear Ed Burton,\r\n\r\nThank you for following up. As previously discussed, item #3, copied in below, was determined overly broad. I have also copied in the response for ease of reference. However, it was determined that similar previous records releases would be provided to you as they contained a similar search criteria. Upon further review of those records, we intended to release to you, it was discovered that yes, the custodian and keywords were similar, the date reference was not. Therefore, we are uncertain if the previous release would be responsive to your request.\r\nTo summarize, you have selected departments, however, specific custodians are necessary to perform an email search. You have also provided keywords, but this list is overly broad and will likely produce a voluminous set of records. For the keywords, we would ask that you narrow and prioritize the list to allow us to conduct a search for a reasonable number of records. We will then acknowledge your request and provide records to you on a rolling basis. I\u2019d like to propose a few options to assist you in getting the records you want as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Confirm the UC Davis custodians you are interested in. Below is a suggestion of custodians:\r\n     *   Chancellor, Gary May\r\n     *   Vice Chancelor, Pablo Reguerin\r\n  *   Narrow a timeframe\r\n  *   Identify a specific record\r\n  *   We can release previous communications related to the same departments and keywords to you. However, the date range is not similar.\r\n  *   Prioritize your keyword list. At this time, you have requested:\r\n\r\n  1.  protests\r\n  2.  demonstrations\r\n  3.  occupation\r\n  4.  camp\r\n  5.  encampment\r\n  6.  Israel\r\n  7.  Gaza\r\n  8.  Palestine\r\n  9.  Anti-semitism\r\n  10. Islamophobia\r\n  11. PULP\r\n  12. Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine\r\nPlease note, it is possible exempt exemptions may apply to some of these records. These exemptions could include:\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 954 and Code of Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2018.030(a), respectively, as incorporated into Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.705);\r\n\u00b7         Records that are exempt due to the deliberative process privilege under Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000. Courts have applied section 7922.000 to exclude from public review materials the disclosure of which \u201cwould expose an agency's decision-making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency's ability to perform its functions\u201d (Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1342.). The materials withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege meet the requirements that the materials are both pre-decisional and deliberative (American Civil Liberties Union of Northern Cal. v. Superior Court (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 76.);\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Personnel, medical, or similar files are exempt pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.700, and personal contact information is exempt from disclosure pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000, where disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; The public interest served by withholding private personal contact information outweighs any public interest served by disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Exempt from disclosure pursuant to The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g). FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of records directly pertaining to students, and generally prohibits the disclosure of such records to the public without the consent of the affected student(s).  (34 CFR 99.30 and 99.31).\r\n\r\n3. Any email correspondence between the University of California Office of the President (UCOP), the UC Davis Office of the Chancellor, the UC Davis Associate Chancellor/Chief of Staff, and Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs between April 20, 2024 and and the time that this request is processed, that mention the following words: \"protests,\" \"demonstrations,\" \"occupation,\" \"camp,\" \"encampment,\" \"Israel,\" \"Gaza,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Anti-semitism,\" \"Islamophobia,\" \"PULP,\" or \"Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine.\"\r\n           UC has considered your request and before we can acknowledge it, we need to address the fact that it\u2019s overly broad. Even \u201ca clearly framed request\u201d may be unduly burdensome if it \u201crequires an agency to search an enormous volume of data for a \u2018needle in the haystack\u2019 or conversely, \u2026compels the production of a huge volume of material.\u201d California First Amendment Coalition v.
