I am requesting any records in the possession of the WDFW that pertain to the following:\r\n\r\n(1) Wolf population management plans, reports, and studies.\r\n\r\n(2) Records of communication between the WDFW and other state or federal agencies, as well as tribal governments and non-governmental organizations, regarding gray wolf management and conservation.\r\n\r\n(3) Records related to permits issued by the WDFW for the lethal removal of wolves, including but not limited to applications, authorizations, and reports.\r\n\r\n(4) Records related to monitoring and research activities conducted by the WDFW, including but not limited to GPS tracking data and population surveys.\r\n\r\n\r\n***Clarification Needed:\r\nProgram staff that are seeking records responsive to your request are asking for the following clarifying information:\r\n\r\nPlease provide a timeframe for this request.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520, failure to provide clarification may result in the request being closed. Please respond no later than May 1, 2023.\r\n\r\n**Please Note: Many of the records you have requested are expected to contain information that is exempt, as provided by the Public Records Act, RCW 42.56<https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56>. WDFW must apply all required exemptions by redacting sensitive information from records before producing them to requestors. Not only does the Public Records Act apply to WDFW, but many of the records you have requested are expected to also have information that is exempt specifically by RCW 42.56.430<https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.430>.\r\n\r\nConsistent with RCW 42.56.520, additional time is needed to search for records, review for sensitive information, and respond to this request. We anticipate our next response and estimate an installment of records no later than July 6, 2023.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.120 provides that agencies may charge fees to recover the cost of producing copies of records when fulfilling public records requests. The fee schedule is available on the WDFW Public Records webpage<https://wdfw.wa.gov/about/administration/public-records>.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me by phone at (564) 669-4827 or by email at Jennifer.Brown@dfw.wa.gov<mailto:Jennifer.Brown@dfw.wa.gov> if you have questions concerning this public records request.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\nJennifer Brown, JD\r\nPublic Records Analyst | Public Records Unit\r\nWashington Department of Fish and Wildlife\r\nMS# 43146\r\nPO Box 43200, Olympia, WA 98501\r\nJennifer.Brown@dfw.wa.gov | (564) 669-4827",

I appreciate your prompt response regarding my public records request, PRR No. 22759. After reviewing the estimated cost of approximately $900.00 to scan the 6,000 records, I would like to explore the possibility of setting up a payment plan for this fee.\r\n\r\nGiven the nature of my work as an investigative journalist, managing expenses is crucial, and while I'm committed to covering the costs, it would be more manageable for me to make payments over time.\r\n\r\nCould you please provide information on whether the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife offers payment plans or if we can discuss a structured payment schedule? I want to ensure that I can receive the requested records while also meeting my financial obligations.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if it's possible to proceed with the scanning of the records while we work out the payment plan details, please let me know. This would allow me to start reviewing the materials as soon as possible for my investigative work.\r\n\r\nThank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your guidance on this matter.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJordan Lassiter",

The requests focused on decisions Durkan and other city officials made amid racial justice protests and unrest in the city\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood last year.\r\n\r\nThe claims allege Irwin and Ferreiro were required to \u201cperform illegal acts\u201d and \u201csubjected to scorn, ridicule, abuse and hostility\u201d in retaliation for trying to comply with the law, The Seattle Times reported.\u201d\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records in the care custody or control of the SEATTLE CITY ATTORNEY or in the alternative the CITY OF SEATTLE:\r\n\r\n1.

This is the King County Public Records Program. You are requesting Seattle City Attorney records which would be held by the City of Seattle, not King County. If the Seattle City Attorney\u2019s Office filed records with the King County Superior Court, you would need to contact the Court for those records. That is why you were provided with the Court referral in our previous email.\r\n\r\nPlease contact the Seattle City Attorney using the link below:\r\nhttps://www.seattle.gov/cityattorney\r\n\r\nTo confirm, yes your request with the King County Executive Branch is closed. Please contact the City of Seattle directly for Seattle City Attorney records, and contact the Superior Court directly to request any records they may have.\nRegards,\r\nThe Public Records Program",

The requests focused on decisions Durkan and other city officials made amid racial justice protests and unrest in the city\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood last year.\r\n\r\nThe claims allege Irwin and Ferreiro were required to \u201cperform illegal acts\u201d and \u201csubjected to scorn, ridicule, abuse and hostility\u201d in retaliation for trying to comply with the law, The Seattle Times reported.\u201d\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records in the care custody or control of the SEATTLE CITY ATTORNEY or in the alternative the CITY OF SEATTLE:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic .pdf copy of all public documents filed with the King County Superior Clerk of the Court in case # 21-2-11739-9 SEA - IRWIN ET ANO VS CITY OF SEATTLE.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter.\r\nNo official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The requests focused on decisions Durkan and other city officials made amid racial justice protests and unrest in the city\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood last year.\r\n\r\nThe claims allege Irwin and Ferreiro were required to \u201cperform illegal acts\u201d and \u201csubjected to scorn, ridicule, abuse and hostility\u201d in retaliation for trying to comply with the law, The Seattle Times reported.\u201d\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records in the care custody or control of the SEATTLE CITY ATTORNEY or in the alternative the CITY OF SEATTLE:\r\n\r\n1.

The requests focused on decisions Durkan and other city officials made amid racial justice protests and unrest in the city\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood last year.\r\n\r\nThe claims allege Irwin and Ferreiro were required to \u201cperform illegal acts\u201d and \u201csubjected to scorn, ridicule, abuse and hostility\u201d in retaliation for trying to comply with the law, The Seattle Times reported.\u201d\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records in the care custody or control of the SEATTLE CITY ATTORNEY or in the alternative the CITY OF SEATTLE:\r\n\r\n1.

We assigned your request tracking number ATFY22-145.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence concerning your request.\r\n\r\n           To the extent that your request requires a search in another Office, consultations with other Department of Justice components or another agency, and/or involves a voluminous amount of material, your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).  Accordingly, we will need to extend the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\r\n\r\nWe assign and process requests on a multitrack basis.  The time needed to complete our work on your request will depend on several factors, including the complexity of our records search, the volume and complexity of any material located, and the order of receipt of your request.  At this time, we have assigned your request to the complex track.  In an effort to speed up our process, you may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records. You can also agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located.  Any decision with regard to fees will be made after we determine whether fees will apply to this request.\r\n\r\nWe regret the necessity of this delay, but we assure you that your request will be processed as soon as possible. If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact this Office by telephone at the above number, or you may write to the above address.  You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison, Wayne Foster, at the above telephone number or address to discuss any aspect of your request.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (\"OGIS\") at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\n                                                                                   Sincerely,\r\n\nFOIA/Privacy Act Unit\r\nAntitrust Division",

The Department of Banking is transitioning to a new online FOI management system called GovQA, accessible on the Department webpage:  https://FOI-Freedom-of-Information-Requests.

The Department is seeking to upload your request into the GovQA platform.  I am in communication with the Division responsible for managing the \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d records to which you refer, and I expect to issue a final response by September 29th at the latest, hopefully by September 21st.  (I will be away September 22nd \u2013 September 25th).  Please note that the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission interprets \u2018promptly\u2019 under CGS Section 1\u201119(a), as \u201c \u2026 quickly and without undue delay, [considering] all of the factors presented by a particular request.

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

In order to ensure an adequate response, your request requires clarification. We have identified an MS Excel list of 3,267 flight events which includes the following data elements: - Flight Date/Time - Flight Title (i.e. case number, if included) - Flight Description (i.e. case related or training*, etc., if included) - Takeoff Lat/Long (i.e. location) - Air Time - Air Seconds *note: most training events are blank This list includes Lat/Long so requires review of each event where there is a case number (investigation) to determine case status prior to release of the list. Open and active investigations are categorically exempt so we would not provide lat/long information. Based on current request volume and the time to review and determine each case status, we would anticipate completion of our review by April 10, 2023. If we are unable to meet this self-imposed deadline, we will let you know, and if we're able to provide a response sooner, we will certainly\u00a0do so. If, however, you're willing for us to remove the \"Takeoff Lat/Long\" column, we can provide a response much sooner. If we don't hear from you by , we will proceed with review of each individual investigation and you can expect a response by November 9, 2023 April 10, 2023. Your request is subject to fees as allowed under King County Ordinance 18949 and the Public Records Act, RCW 42.56.120. Please visit our and select \"What is the cost to obtain records\" for more information. Once we have determined the scope of your request and responsive records, we may provide an estimate for fees requiring 10% down prior to processing your request. website PLEASE NOTE: Per RCW 42.56.120(4), the KCSO reserves the right to close a records request after 30 days if a requester does not inspect, view, download, and/or pick up the records we provide. There is no obligation for us to continue producing records that are not being collected by a requester. RCW 42.56.120(4) states that if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. WAC 44-14-04006(1) states that a records request has been fulfilled and can be closed if an entirely unclear request has not been clarified,a request or installment has not been claimed or reviewed, or the requester cancels the request. \r\nPlease reply directly to this message or log in to the Online Request System if you have any questions or would like to clarify or cancel this request.

This should include contracts for CCWIS or comparable systems that include predictive models as well as project descriptions for any models created in-house.\r\n\r\n2) Data dictionaries for all child welfare predictive models used by the department, including those provided by outside entities as well as in-house models. Data dictionaries are  documents commonly created for predictive models and databases. They describe the categories of data that are inputs (age, gender, etc.) and outputs (risk level, etc.) of predictive models. They are equivalent to headers on a spreadsheet, and do not include actual data.\r\n\r\n3) A list of all memorandums of understanding (MOUs) and/or data sharing agreements with state or local agencies for the provision of data that is incorporated into the department's child welfare predictive models. Should the department not maintain a list of these MOUs, I will accept copies of the MOUs themselves.\r\n\r\n4) Any differential impact assessments, validation studies, or comparable documents that describe the accuracy of child welfare predictive models used by the department.

In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employ involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed breakdown of the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help, and I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

As such, it should be a straightforward task for the department to identify the relevant software/systems. Please don't hesitate to call me for further clarification if the department cannot identify the software/systems it uses.\r\n\r\n1) Contracts with companies, nonprofits, or other entities that currently provide software to the department that includes predictive analytics models for child welfare (i.e., models designed to identify home placement risk, abuse risk, human trafficking risk, etc.). This should include contracts for CCWIS or comparable systems that include predictive models as well as project descriptions for any models created in-house.\r\n\r\n2) Data dictionaries for the child welfare predictive models currently used by the department, including those provided by outside entities as well as in-house models. Data dictionaries are documents commonly created for predictive models and databases. They describe the categories of data that are inputs (age, gender, etc.) and outputs (risk level, etc.) of predictive models. They are equivalent to headers on a spreadsheet, and do not include actual data.\r\n\r\n3) Memorandums of understanding (MOUs) and/or data sharing agreements with state or local agencies for the provision of data that is incorporated into the department's current child welfare predictive models.

According to dispatch audio, officers with OPD responded to the scene and pursued a suspect on foot.  At 12:21 (near 1231 51st Ave), they had the suspect in custody.  I am looking for records that indicate the number of officers who responded to this incident, and, if any exist, investigative reports and body camera footage from the officers who responded.  I am also looking for any arrest reports.\r\n\r\nI request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically.\r\n\r\nNews media status and fee waiver:\r\n\r\nAs a reporter for WIRED, I qualify as a news media requester for the purpose of fees. Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees. This request is not primarily in the commercial interest of myself or WIRED. Additionally, please notify me of costs before taking any billable steps.\r\n\r\nSegregability:\r\n\r\nIf you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory exemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to only a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and provide the remainder of the record.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my request, please do not hesitate to e-mail me at dhruv_mehrotra@wired.com. Conde Nast's legal counsel is also copied on this letter. We look forward to a response as quickly as possible under applicable law.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

Therefore, we have forwarded it to\r\nour *Office of Research Services, Special Access and FOIA* (RF) staff who\r\nhandle FOIA requests for such archival records.\r\n\r\nSince *Research Services* does not process FOIA requests through\r\n*FOIAOnline*, we removed your request from the *FOIAOnline* website.  *Special\r\nAccess *staff will assign you a new tracking number, and respond directly\r\nto you.

Your request was received in this office on May 11,\r\n2021 and assigned FOIA tracking number 65692, interim tracking number\r\nRF-737.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to FBI file numbers 100-HQ-440363, 100-WF-41792,\r\n100-HQ-344527, 62-HQ-107350, and/or 100-NY-164641 on Gavin Hall MacFayden.\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Our initial assessment is that Gavin Hall MacFayden is the subject of\r\n   100-NY-164641, compiled as part of a domestic security\r\ninvestigation, created\r\n   between November 1968 and March 1990, and consisting of an estimated 13\r\n   pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Our initial assessment is that the Socialist Youth League is the subject\r\n   of 100-HQ-344527, compiled as part of a domestic security\r\ninvestigation, created\r\n   between March 1941 and September 1973, and consisting of an estimated 9,000\r\n   pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Our initial assessment is that Women Strike Force is the subject of\r\n   62-HQ-107350, compiled as part of an administrative inquiry\r\n   investigation, created between October 1961 and January 1978, and\r\n   consisting of an estimated 16,000 pages\r\n\r\n\r\nThese records require review for information protected from release under the\r\nFOIA <https://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine>:\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe estimated total page count for your request is 25,013 pages.

        "communication": "Dear Jermaine Scott,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response. I agree that narrowing this request would be a good next step to decide about how to proceed for all documents. Thank you for the information. I would like to narrow the request to a subset of the documents mentioned for the case files that I have requested.\r\n\r\nI would like to request a fully copy of 100-NY-164641 (13 pages), and then the first ten pages chronologically of files 100-HQ-344527 (10 pages) and 62-HQ-107350 (10 pages). I believe that this will allow me to make a determination of how to proceed at a later date for 100-HQ-344527 and 62-HQ-107350. Additionally, it should be well below the cap for third tier processing. Would this reduction put my request into a speedy tier or a faster queue? If it is easier to simply narrow to a single locator, I would select 100-NY-164641 and I'm willing to pay for it.\r\n\r\nIf it is also possible to perform a simple release of the already reviewed 100-WF-41792 and 100-HQ-440363 documents, I would like this as well, but only if it does not significantly slow down the response time.  I want to ensure that I receive those full documents from NARA directly.\r\n\r\nI would also like to discuss the possibility of a public interest/journalistic/academic fee waiver or reduction. Gavin was an internationally recognized American journalist working in London, England in the public interest; these documents will help me to inform the public about his life and work. If a fee waiver or fee reduction is not possible, I'm willing to pay immediately for the narrowed files.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to have a telephone call to discuss this narrowing process if that would be useful. Thank you for your time today, I look forward to discussing this request further with you. \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nJacob",

        "communication": "Dear Jacob,\r\n\r\nWe will narrow your request to a full copy of 100-NY-164641 (13 pages), and\r\nthen the first ten pages chronologically of files 100-HQ-344527 (10 pages)\r\nand 62-HQ-107350 (10 pages).\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I can not attest to one queue being faster than the other.\r\nWe are diligently working through our current FOIA request from the public\r\nlike yourself.\r\n\r\nYou can request copies of 100-WF-41792 and 100-HQ-440363. The National\r\nArchives and Records Administration is closed to researcher visits and has\r\nsuspended reproduction and digitization services until further notice due\r\nto COVID-19. Once the research rooms have reopened, you or your designated\r\nrepresentative may view the redacted file at the National Archives in\r\nCollege Park, Maryland. To monitor the status of the reopening of the\r\nNational Archives at College Park to the public and the resumption of copy\r\norders, visit https://www.archives.gov/coronavirus. If you cannot visit our\r\nCollege Park facility, you may order a reproduction copy at the cost of 80\r\ncents per page by contacting our office at specialaccess_foia@nara.gov or\r\n301-837-3190 to place an order. A mailing/billing address is required to\r\ngenerate a price quote, so please include that information with your\r\nreproduction request. Please note that any orders placed will not be\r\nserviced until such time that operations can resume safely. We apologize\r\nfor any inconvenience. Once operations resume, your reproduction request\r\nwill be serviced in the order it was received.\r\n\r\nYou asked for a waiver of the fees normally charged for providing\r\nresearchers with copies of archival records. The fee and fee waiver\r\nprovisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), however, do not apply\r\nto the archival records. The FOIA fee section states that \u201cNothing in this\r\nsubparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable under a statute specifically\r\nproviding for setting the level of fees for particular types of records\u201d [5\r\nUSC 552 (a) (94 ) (vi)]. Accordingly, the NARA fee statute, 44 USC 2116\r\n(c), and implementing regulations at 36 CFR Part 1258, apply exclusively to\r\nyour request, under which the National Archives does not waive reproduction\r\ncharges for individual requesters. Our inability to grant you the requested\r\nfee waiver does not constitute a denial for the purpose of the FOIA.\r\n\r\nWe are legally bound to charge reproduction fees for our records (more\r\ninformation can be found in our regulations: Title 36: Parks, Forests, and\r\nPublic Property, PART 1258\u2014FEES\r\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=ba12875cd02d4f84c4062c1ea87b9208&h=L&mc=true&r=PART&n=pt36.3.1258\r\n<https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=ba12875cd02d4f84c4062c1ea87b9208&h=L&mc=true&r=PART&n=pt36.3.1258>).\r\nAdditionally, our fee schedule is based on the native format of the\r\nrecords; as these records were originally paper, the reproduction fee is\r\n$.80 per page.\r\n\r\n\r\nJermaine Scott\r\nArchives Specialist\r\nSpecial Access and FOIA Program",

On\r\nJanuary 14, 2022, Archives Specialist Jermaine Scott provided you with your\r\npermanent FOIA tracking number *RD 65692*. Please reference this FOIA\r\ntracking number on all future correspondence concerning this request.\r\n\r\nOn February 9, 2022 you requested that we narrow your request to receiving\r\na full copy of FBI Files 100-NY-164641 (13 pages), the first 10 pages of\r\n100-HQ-344527, and 62-HQ-107350 (10 pages). Combined the total page count\r\nfor your request comes to 33 pages. Your request does not exceed 700 pages,\r\nso it is assigned to our first-tier processing queue. The estimated time of\r\ncompletion for your request is 39 months from Mr. Scott's February 9, 2022\r\nemail to you.\r\n\r\nTo give you an indication of our existing backlog for cases in Tier 1,\r\nthere are approximately 992 cases ahead of yours. Unfortunately, the\r\nCOVID-19 pandemic has created many unprecedented challenges in our work.\r\nThe majority of the records that our customers request require our staff to\r\nbe on-site to search for and review microfilm, microfiche, or original\r\ntextual records. Staffing levels on-site have been severely limited with\r\nlong periods where our facility was closed. Even as we expand our\r\nreopening, operations may be temporarily curtailed due to limited staffing\r\nand/or deteriorating local health conditions.\r\n\r\nOur small staff has and will continue to work diligently to process each\r\nrequest as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n*Please note, we will not respond to status update requests more than once\r\nevery six months.*\r\n\r\nTo notify this office of a change in your contact information or to track\r\nthe status of your request, please telephone 301-837-3190 or e-mail\r\nspecialaccess_foia@nara.gov.

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThank you for your latest reply. On 06/09/2022 I was informed that \"The estimated time of completion for your request is 39 months from Mr. Scott's February 9, 2022 email to you.\" By my understanding this is roughly in the middle of 2025. Unfortunately this is an unacceptable time window for the purpose of this FOIA, and a lack of statutory compliance is hampering my research and publication efforts. I understand that COVID-19 is an exceptional circumstance. As I have already narrowed my request extensively because of delays, I request that this now greatly narrowed request is expedited.\r\n\r\nI specifically request expedited processing as this data is for use in a news article that is pending. Part of the article is based on the results of this FOIA. Specifically, I declare that \"if the request is made by an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity; or,\"  The information in my request is urgently needed to inform the public about government surveillance activities of American journalists such as Mr. MacFayden who primarily live abroad.  I'm willing to have my editor write a letter confirming these facts, if that is useful.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I also assert that my FOIA relates to another NARA exception: \"when the subject is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\" Requesting Gavin MacFadyen's FBI file resulted in the case numbers at NARA, and since Mr. MacFadyen was subject to government surveillance, this FOIA concerns a matter of the government's integrity, and naturally the results will affect the public confidence in our government. Delaying the result certainly will affect the public confidence in our government.\r\n\r\nAs per NARA's web page on requesting expedited processing, I assert that the above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhat's the next step for receiving expedited processing? According to the website, I will receive a reply within ten calendar days - if there is supplemental information that I can provide sooner, please advise and I will attempt to supply this information in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nJacob",

Your request was received in this office on May 11,\r\n2021 and assigned FOIA interim number RD 65692. You requested access to FBI\r\nfile numbers 100-HQ-440363, 100-WF-41792, 100-HQ-344527, 62-HQ-107350, and\r\n100-NY-164641 on Gavin Hall Macfadyen. In January 2022 you narrowed your\r\nrequest to the first ten pages each of 100-HQ-344527 and 62-HQ-107350, and\r\nthe whole of 100-NY-164641.\r\n\r\nWe completed a line-by-line review of the records you requested. To\r\nminimize reproduction costs to you and avoid reviewing only a partial\r\ndocument, we processed whole serials from 100-HQ-344527 and 62-HQ-107350 up\r\nto a sum of 10 pages; additional serials would take you over the ten-page\r\nthreshold in either instance. We have therefore reviewed serials 1, X1, and\r\nX2 from 100-HQ-344527 for a total of 8 pages, and serials 1-2 from 62-HQ-107350\r\nfor a total of 9 pages. Please contact me directly if you require\r\nadditional pages from either case file.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe completed a line-by-line review of the records you requested. Please be\r\nadvised, we have considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing\r\nrecords and applying FOIA exemptions for this request. Information was\r\nreleased to the greatest extent possible.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Spokane Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nIn the event the District chooses to provide these records in installments over time I request the records to be produced in reverse chronological order - from the most recent records to the earliest.\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the PRA. I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

        "communication": "To Whom It Concerns:\r\n\r\nThe District has received your request dated November 4, 2021 at 11:11pm for public record requests received from January 1, 2010- November 4, 2021 and responses to these requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to process your request, we find clarification is necessary. Please clarify if you are seeking records released in response to these requests, or just the communication responding to the request, without the records that were provided in response to the request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis clarification is necessary because, as a school district,  many of our requests are made by parents or legal representatives of students requesting email records that discuss students and students\u2019 education.  Student records are protected under RCW 42.56.230 and the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).  Redacting these records in order to release them to you will take a considerable amount of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same holds true for public record requests made by staff members for records, which would be released largely unredacted to the staff member but would require considerable redactions prior to releasing them to anyone else.  Our Collective Bargaining Agreements also require notification require prior to releasing records that discuss staff, even in a redacted state. We would like to provide the records you are seeking as quickly and efficiently as possible but would like to avoid additional time-intensive work if you are not seeking those records.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our office follows the record retention schedules established by the Washington Secretary of State, we will not be able to provide records dating back to 2010. We will work with our technology staff to retrieve electronic records dating back to June 30, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act, chapter 42.56 RCW, and more specifically RCW 42.56.520 recognizes that additional time to respond to a request is allowed when needed to clarify the intent of the request, to determine if any of the information requested is exempt, to notify third parties affected by the request, or to locate and assemble the information requested.  Given the nature of the request, that is the case here.  The District anticipates being able to release records on or before January 4, 2022.  The sooner you respond to our request for clarification, the sooner we will be able to begin work on your request.  Please let us know if you are no longer seeking records to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org",

Thank you for the clarification email you sent on November 12, 2021.  We have compiled records beginning with the date of your request and working backward to June 30, 2017, which is the extent of the District's email retention date.  Once we have released records to you that do not need additional redactions, we will begin to re-process the records that need additional redactions starting from November 4, 2021 and working backwards to June 30, 2017.\r\n\r\nPlease note, this request will take a substantial amount of time to redact records that were previously released to parents, which contain their students' education records, or staff members' who have requested their own records, etc.  Please let me know if you are only requesting records that do not require additional redactions.\r\n\r\nThe District has compiled the first installment of responsive records to this request.  The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a disc for you.  The charge for the records is $2.00.  The disc may be picked up at the cashier's desk on the second floor of the Administration building - at which time the disc will be release to you.  Or, if you prefer, you may make a check or money order payable to Spokane Public Schools in the amount of $3.70, which includes the cost of the envelope and postage.  Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested disc will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201<https://maps.google.com/?q=200+North+Bernard+Street,+Spokane,+WA+99201&entry=gmail&source=g> Attn: Public Records Office.

If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor.

Thank you for the clarification email you sent on November 12, 2021.  We have compiled records beginning with the date of your request and working backward to June 30, 2017, which is the extent of the District's email retention date.  Once we have released records to you that do not need additional redactions, we will begin to re-process the records that need additional redactions starting from November 4, 2021 and working backwards to June 30, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe District has compiled another installment of responsive records to this request.  The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a disc for you.  The charge for mailing the records to you is $1.70. Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested disc will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201<https://maps.google.com/?q=200+North+Bernard+Street,+Spokane,+WA+99201&entry=gmail&source=g> Attn: Public Records Office.\r\n\r\nPlease note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor.  The Legend of Color Coded Redactions will contain the specifics on the redactions in each installment released to the requestors.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before June 3, 2022.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org<mailto:CheriS@SpokaneSchools.org>",

For example, records which were previously provided to parents or employees that contain exempt information would need additional review and redaction prior to releasing these records to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease clarify within 30 days whether you are, in fact, seeking those records which will require additional review and redaction. If we do not receive clarification from you within 30 days, we will assume you are not seeking those records which require additional redaction.\r\n\r\nThe District has compiled another installment of responsive records to this request.  The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a thumb drive for you. If you would like the records, the cost is $7.21 to include the cost of the thumb drive, envelope and postage.  Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested records will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201<https://maps.google.com/?q=200+North+Bernard+Street,+Spokane,+WA+99201&entry=gmail&source=g> Attn: Public Records Office.\r\n\r\nPlease note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted prior to the release of the records to the original requestor.  The Legend of Color Coded Redactions will contain the specifics on the redactions in each installment released to the requestors.\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before December 22, 2022. Please let me know if you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org<mailto:CheriS@SpokaneSchools.org>",

The responsive records are too large to send via email and have been saved to a thumb drive for you. If you would like the records, the cost is $7.45 to include the cost of the thumb drive, envelope and postage. Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested records will be mailed to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201  Attn: Public Records Office.  Please note, the Administration building will be closed beginning December 23, 2022 and will reopen on January 3, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease also note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency's notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will see some records have been redacted. Please see the Legend of Color Coded Redactions for the specifics on the redactions in each installment released to the requestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the District continues to process this request, it is anticipated that the next installment date will be on or before April 21, 2023 due to the records needing additional review, redactions and or third party notification prior to releasing the records to your organization. Please let me know if you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSincerely,\r\nCheri Skutley\r\n\r\nCheri Skutley, CPRO\r\nRecords Specialist\r\nSpokane Public Schools\r\n200 North Bernard Street\r\nSpokane, WA 99201\r\n509-354-7332 Office\r\n509-354-5959 Fax\r\nCheriS@SpokaneSchools.org<mailto:CheriS@SpokaneSchools.org>\r\n\r\n\r\n\"...Just Keep Moving.\" -Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.",

We now understand why our past installments were being sent back to us \"return to sender\".  In the future, please direct any communications regarding your request either directly to me, or to District representative Terri LeFors.  I have included Terri on this communication to ensure you have her email address moving forward.  If you do feel the need to continue to send communications regarding your public records request via U.S. Mail, please ensure that any mailings contain language directing the email directly to Terri (i.e., \"attn: Terri LeFors\") rather than the District in general.\r\n\r\nYour past communication went to the District's billing department, who does not handle the processing of public records requests.  Thus, any communications you send to the District in general (or to the billing department specifically) may not be received by the District's public records department.  In the meantime, we will resend your previous installments to you at your newly-provided address.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, we believe it may take us a few more days than originally anticipated to provide you with the next installment.  We now estimate being able to provide you with that installment on or before October 13, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlex Fern\r\nAssociate Attorney\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D9EF9A.19E04330]\r\n510 W.

Pursuant to the Tennessee Open Records Act, I\u2019m writing to request the following: \r\n\r\n1. Any records documenting the number of times your agency used force against a person aged 17 or under, including date of incident, age, race, gender and type of force.  \r\n\r\n2. Any data dictionary that you use to compile use of force data. \r\n\r\n3. Your agency\u2019s blank use of force form used to compile use of force reports.  \r\n\r\n4.  Any records documenting the type of call, location and subsequent criminal charges, if any. \r\n\r\n5. Your agency\u2019s use of force policy manual. \r\n\r\n6. The total number of officers in your agency currently who carry Conducted Energy Weapons, such as TASERs, as well as the overall number of officers. \r\n\r\nIf you believe that a portion of the information I have requested is exempt from disclosure by express provisions of the law, and if you believe that the public interest in withholding the information clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure, I request that you identify in writing the harm of release to the public considering the important interest of transparency in government operations, particularly when public funds are involved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nThis request is filed by Kent Hoover, a citizen of Tennessee, in coordination with Wendy Ruderman.",

Any data dictionary that you use to compile use of force data.\r\n\r\n3. Your agency's blank use of force form used to compile use of force reports.\r\n\r\n4. Any records documenting the type of call, location and subsequent criminal charges, if any.\r\n\r\n5. Your agency's use of force policy manual.\r\n\r\n6. The total number of officers in your agency currently who carry Conducted Energy Weapons, such as TASERs, as well as the overall number of officers.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that a portion of the information I have requested is exempt from disclosure by express provisions of the law, and if you believe that the public interest in withholding the information clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure, I request that you identify in writing the harm of release to the public considering the important interest of transparency in government operations, particularly when public funds are involved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Adri\u00e1n Lamo, or \"The Homeless Hacker\" (Born February 20, 1981 \u2013 Died March 14, 2018). Adrian Lamo was born in Malden, Massachusetts on February 20, 1981 \r\n and has been reported deceased in Wichita, Kansas on March 14, 2018. Major media outlets across America as of March 14, 2018 have reported his death including The Wichita Eagle: http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article205629184.html and follow up article https://www.kansas.com/latest-news/article210989594.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS),  Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Adrian Lamo.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that Mr. Adrian Lamo's DNA is on file in the CODIS database, as well as his fingerprints in the IAFIS database, are held by the FBI due to the very public court battle on the matter as published by Wired in 2007: https://www.wired.com/2007/06/hacker-adrian-l/\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Adrian Lamo.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Adrian Lamo.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Adrian Lamo including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nMr.  Adrian Lamo was a controversial public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJacob Appelbaum\n\n",

In order to be more specific in my request, I am seeking the following record types related to personnel records:\r\n\r\nPerformance evaluations\r\nDisciplinary records\r\nTraining records\r\nAttendance records\r\nAny correspondence regarding promotions, demotions, or transfers\r\nRegarding the email request, I understand the need for clarification on the different types of email recipients. Please find the definitions for each type below:\r\n\r\nSent mail: Emails sent by the subject employee.\r\nCC (Carbon Copy): Emails where the subject employee is included as a secondary recipient, typically for their information or awareness.\r\nBCC (Blind Carbon Copy): Emails where the subject employee is included as a hidden recipient, usually to maintain their privacy or confidentiality.\r\nMetadata: The data providing information about the emails in question, such as sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and email size.\r\nPlease ensure that your search for responsive records includes the above-mentioned email types and associated metadata.\r\n\r\nAs established in the case law Matter of Data Tree, LLC v. Romaine, 9 NY3d 454 (2007), the courts have determined that email metadata, as a component of electronic records, is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\n\r\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to receiving your response. If you have any questions or require further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me \r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nJordan ",

I have a general sense of the email records that we have that mention The Hacking Team, and I'd be happy to describe what I've reviewed so far and hopefully determine which of these records would be useful to you and which would not. That way I could provide you with a smaller quantity of potentially useful records in a shorter period of time.\r\n\r\nI should be free any time Wednesday morning, Thursday, or Friday.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSteve Giballa\r\nSenior Counsel, Cyber Law\r\nUnited States Secret Service\r\n202-507-1494\r\n\r\nAll e-mail to/from this account is subject to official review and is for official use only.

Our CIO\u2019s search of USSS email records turned up a bit over 30,000 emails that included the phrase \u201cHacking Team.\u201d From the couple thousand I\u2019ve reviewed so far, most of these are emails from the Hacking Team that appear to have been distributed to a kind of list-serve. Each email is typically a link to a news story about either cybercrime or just a foreign policy/national security story, with some editorializing from David Vincenzetti. We have multiple copies of each of these emails, which appear to have been sent to the list on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nSo I think the initial question is are you interested in receiving copies of these emails from the Hacking Team? Or would you rather only receive records of emails generated within the USSS that are in some way about the Hacking Team? That second category is going to be much smaller.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m happy to answer any follow-up questions about this as well. Hope the recovery is going well.\n-Steve",
