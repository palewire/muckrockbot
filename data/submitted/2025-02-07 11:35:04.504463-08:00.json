        "communication": "Dear Mr. Carollo: \r\n\r\nThe Department of the Navy received your Freedom of Information (FOIA) / Privacy Act (PA) request dated February 5, 2025, and placed it in queue for processing by order of receipt on the same day. \r\n\r\nUnusual circumstances arise when a response within the statutory 20-day period may not be attainable due to: \r\n\r\n1. Collection and search for records from a facility outside of this office. \r\n2. Volume of records that may be responsive to your request. \r\n3. Consultation with one or more agencies having a substantial interest in the determination or the subject matter. \r\n\r\nThe Navy FOIA program is decentralized, requiring our office to search and gather documents from Navy component offices which are not geographically co-located. Per the Department of the Navy FOIA/PA regulation 32 CFR \u00a7701.8(g)(2), this office grants itself an extension of ten days response time. We appreciate your patience and understand the importance of timely responses to FOIA requests and apologize for any inconvenience this delay may cause. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, please be aware that the U.S. Navy\u2019s new FOIA portal, Secure Release, is online. For your convenience, you may now submit FOIA requests online at www.SecureRelease.us or www.FOIA.gov. \r\n\r\nPlease direct questions to the FOIA Service Center by phone (202) 685-0412 or send via email don-foia-pa@us.navy.mil. \r\n\r\nU.S. Navy Headquarters (FOIA) \r\n2000 Navy Pentagon \r\nWashington, DC 20350-1200 \r\ndon-foia-pa@us.navy.mil",

Bush to request special permission to allow the members of Natural to fly. Not only did President Bush grant special permission, but he also sent special planes to pick them up in New York. Lou Pearlman was so powerful that he could bypass strict national laws for his personal benefit.
