These terms are hosted online and are changed by Flock at will and without notice.  The current terms online are not the same terms agreed to by The City.  Archiving of the terms by archive.org is also not possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This new portal will streamline the processing of records.\r\n\r\nPlease see the following link to GovQA to the \"Submit a Records Request\" area Public Records Requests | Oregon Department of Corrections<https://oregondoc.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(erfwg1qlil3uvveemnxer342))/supporthome.aspx>, or more general information can be found in my signature line.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DC91BA.3F4567D0]\r\nLaura Sterling\r\nPublic Records Analyst\r\nLegal Affairs Unit\r\n3723 Fairview Industrial Dr. SE, Suite 200\r\nSalem, OR 97310\r\nCell: 971-375-5381\r\nwww.oregon.gov/DOC\r\n\r\nThe Oregon Department of Corrections has transitioned to an online public records request portal, GovQA.

Record requests that can be provided with less than one hour of staff time will not be billed for labor. If we determine that our office possesses the public records you request, but are voluminous, difficult to locate, and/or contain information that may include open and closed information, we will provide you with a written estimate of the fees that we will require be pre-paid in order to pay for the actual costs associated with (a) locating and/or retrieving the public records from storage, (b) staff time spent in assisting with making copies of the records, including staff time spent examining the records for possible closure and/or redaction, and (c) copying and mailing the requested public records. In addition to billing for labor that exceed one hour of staff time, the following rates shall apply: \r\n \r\n Copies, 25 cents per page after 100 pages \r\n Staff time will be charged at the rate of pay for each person whose time is used in order to assist and/or respond to a specific request. This may include the time spent to access records maintained on computer facilities, review records to determine whether closure exceptions apply and /or to redact open from closed information. For the purpose of transparency, our rates are as follows: general staff time will be charged at $20 per hour, and information technology (IT) services and Legal staff services will be charged at $38 per hour. \r\n Additional fees may be assessed if any other costs are incurred by KDOC in connection with complying with a record request. KDOC will provide an estimate of the fees which shall be paid prior to the department gathering the records. In order to ensure payment, the final cost of providing access to or furnishing copies must be paid before the records are provided. If the final cost is less than the estimate, the requestor will be reimbursed for the difference. 5. If we determine that we do possess the records, but that the records are subject to closure by law, we will provide you with that information with a written citation to the laws allowing or requiring that type of public record to be closed.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\n1. All departmental or municipal policies regarding communication and information sharing between departmental officers or employees and federal agents/agencies within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including but not limited to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The records request includes, but is not limited to, policies regarding: \r\n\r\nA. Fingerprint and other data sharing, \r\n\r\nB. ICE detainer requests,   \r\n\r\nC. Compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including guidance or policies around when communication with ICE officers is allowed, and \r\n\r\nD. Communicating with federal immigration enforcement officers. \r\n\r\nThis request covers any policies that are currently in effect or that have been in effect at any point on or after January 20, 2025. \r\n\r\n2. The three most recent communications (e.g., emails, text messages, call logs or transcripts, or otherwise) between a departmental officer or employee and a federal DHS or ICE employee. In addition, I request all records related to these communications, including, but not limited to, any records indicating that the department was made aware of the communications, discussions of their content or implications, evaluations them for compliance with departmental or other city policies, identification or acknowledgement of any potential policy violations, and any internal responses, disciplinary actions, or follow-up measures resulting from these communications. \r\n\r\n3. All records relating to incidents, if any, from January 20, 2025, to the day this request is responded to, in which an individual was taken from the department\u2019s custody directly into ICE custody. For each incident, the records request includes, but is not limited to, booking and transfer records, communications with ICE or other federal agencies, internal documentation or discussion of the transfer, and internal notes, memos, or documentation referencing communication with DHS or ICE.\r\n\r\nFor each request, I am not seeking identifying information, and I will accept anonymized or redacted data as necessary to protect identities. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. I expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff \r\n\r\nJoshuadankoff@cfjj.org  \r\n\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives \r\n\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice  \r\n\r\n(submitted via MuckRock platform)",
