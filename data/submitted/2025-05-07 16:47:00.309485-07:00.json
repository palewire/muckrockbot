I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Such communications may include, but should not be limited to, emails, correspondence, memos, and transcriptions of telephone calls. \r\n\r\nA previous request from me was rejected by the FBI on the grounds that it would violate Mr. Harris's personal privacy to even acknowledge the existence of such records. As I wrote in my appeal, which was never processed, I do not think this provision applies to my request. To show this, I will first limit the scope of my request to communications between Mr. Harris and the FBI to those communications which are relevant to Mr. Harris's professional work as a writer and novelist. Such communications could not involve a reasonable expectation that they would not be subject to FOIA. Furthermore, even if certain third-party communications are not subject to FOIA, the FBI's own written communications are still subject to FOIA, and my request includes communications from the FBI.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation.
