Please inform me if that is insufficiently narrow.\r\n\r\nI apologize for the waste of your time with the earlier  broad request. It is hard for an outsider to know a priori which individuals might be most relevant, and how many records each individual person or term may return a priori - so I often cast a very broad net to begin with.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER RICCIO",
