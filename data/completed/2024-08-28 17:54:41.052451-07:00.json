That bulletin advised local agencies to be prepared in the event the calls target Nebraska schools.\r\n\r\n- I am looking for a copy of this bulletin\r\n- emails, communications, internal memos or directives about false reports of active shootings or swattings in the last year.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

This would give me the license number for that dealer, in this\r\ncase 44485.  I would then search for any complaints we have associated with\r\nthat license number.  I would then go into OnBase and search for\r\ninvestigations based on that license number.  I would cross reference the\r\ncomplaints from MLO with the results in OnBase to make sure they agree.  I\r\nthen printed all of the reports associated with the cases with the\r\nexception of the case that was presented to the Motor Vehicle Dealer\r\nBoard.  For that case I provided the affidavit of probable cause instead of\r\nthe report.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Gerald Shur.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nEFOIA Request\r\n\r\nI was seeking the release of all files related to the Historic 'Sharebeast' case as highlighted by the quoted press release from the Department of Justice.\r\n\r\nOwner of Sharebeast.com sentenced for copyright infringement\r\n\r\nATLANTA - Artur Sargsyan has been sentenced for the crime of criminal copyright infringement for private financial gain while operating a massive file-sharing infrastructure that distributed approximately 1 billion copies of copyrighted musical works through Internet downloads.  Sargsyan\u2019s file-sharing websites, which contained numerous pop-up advertisements, generated significant profit for him when visitors accessed the websites to illegally download copyrighted works.\r\n\r\n\u201cSargsyan operated one of the most successful illegal music sharing websites on the Internet,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak.  \u201cHis reproduction of copyrighted musical works were made available only to generate undeserved profits for himself.  The incredible work done by our law enforcement partners and prosecutors in light of the complexity of Sargsyan\u2019s operation demonstrates that we will employ all of our resources to stop this kind of theft.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sargsyan was warned several times that he was violating the law by illegally sharing copyrighted works, but chose to ignore those warnings,\u201d said David J. LaValley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. \u201cHis sentence sends a message that no matter how complex the operation, the FBI, its federal partners and law enforcement partners around the globe will go to every length to protect the property of hard working artists and the companies that produce their art.\u201d  \r\n\r\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges and other information presented in court: Artur Sargsyan owned and operated a number of websites including Sharebeast.com, Newjams.net, and Albumjams.com.  From at least 2012 through 2015, Sargsyan illegally distributed and reproduced copyrighted works through Sharebeast.com.  Using a network of websites that he owned and operated, including Newjams.net and Albumjams.com, Sargsyan created links to a wide swath of copyright-protected music that was stored on Sharebeast.com.  Sharebeast illegally stored and distributed works from scores of artists, including Bruno Mars, Linkin Park, Pitbull, Pharrell Williams, Gwen Stefani, Maroon 5, Ariana Grande, Destiny\u2019s Child, Ciara, Katy Perry, Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, Kanye West, and Justin Bieber.  Meanwhile, Sargsyan profited from the distribution of the copies of these copyrighted works.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America (\u201cRIAA\u201d), Sharebeast.com was the largest online file-sharing website specializing in the reproduction and distribution of infringing copies of copyrighted music operating out of the United States.  From 2012 to 2015, the RIAA sent Sargsyan over 100 e-mails notifying him that Sharebeast.com was illegally hosting and sharing copyright-infringing works.  Sargsyan continued, however, to make the copyright-infringing files available for download, disregarding the many warnings that he received.  The RIAA conservatively estimated the total monetary loss to its member companies at $6.3 billion.\r\n\r\nArtur Sargsyan, 30, of Glendale, California, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr., to five years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $458,200.  He was also ordered to forfeit $184,768.87.  Sargsyan was convicted on these charges on September 1, 2017, after he pleaded guilty.\r\n\r\nThis case was investigated by the FBI.\r\n\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Samir Kaushal and Kamal Ghali prosecuted the case.  John Zacharia, formerly the Deputy Chief for Litigation for the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, previously prosecuted the case.  The prosecution reflects a coordinated effort by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS), the Office of International Affairs, the FBI\u2019s field offices in Atlanta, Denver, Chicago, and Los Angeles, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California.  Substantial assistance was provided by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency and the Ministry of Security and Justice in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nFor further information please contact the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Public Affairs Office at USAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.gov or (404) 581-6016.  The Internet address for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia is http://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga.\r\n\r\nVAUGHN Index requested for any materials cited in exemption.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWilliam Fernandes",

Sargsyan\u2019s file-sharing websites, which contained numerous pop-up advertisements, generated significant profit for him when visitors accessed the websites to illegally download copyrighted works.\r\n\r\n\u201cSargsyan operated one of the most successful illegal music sharing websites on the Internet,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak. \u201cHis reproduction of copyrighted musical works were made available only to generate undeserved profits for himself. The incredible work done by our law enforcement partners and prosecutors in light of the complexity of Sargsyan\u2019s operation demonstrates that we will employ all of our resources to stop this kind of theft.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Sargsyan was warned several times that he was violating the law by illegally sharing copyrighted works, but chose to ignore those warnings,\u201d said David J. LaValley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. \u201cHis sentence sends a message that no matter how complex the operation, the FBI, its federal partners and law enforcement partners around the globe will go to every length to protect the property of hard working artists and the companies that produce their art.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges and other information presented in court: Artur Sargsyan owned and operated a number of websites including Sharebeast.com, Newjams.net, and Albumjams.com. From at least 2012 through 2015, Sargsyan illegally distributed and reproduced copyrighted works through Sharebeast.com. Using a network of websites that he owned and operated, including Newjams.net and Albumjams.com, Sargsyan created links to a wide swath of copyright-protected music that was stored on Sharebeast.com. Sharebeast illegally stored and distributed works from scores of artists, including Bruno Mars, Linkin Park, Pitbull, Pharrell Williams, Gwen Stefani, Maroon 5, Ariana Grande, Destiny\u2019s Child, Ciara, Katy Perry, Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, Kanye West, and Justin Bieber. Meanwhile, Sargsyan profited from the distribution of the copies of these copyrighted works.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America (\u201cRIAA\u201d), Sharebeast.com was the largest online file-sharing website specializing in the reproduction and distribution of infringing copies of copyrighted music operating out of the United States. From 2012 to 2015, the RIAA sent Sargsyan over 100 e-mails notifying him that Sharebeast.com was illegally hosting and sharing copyright-infringing works. Sargsyan continued, however, to make the copyright-infringing files available for download, disregarding the many warnings that he received. The RIAA conservatively estimated the total monetary loss to its member companies at $6.3 billion.\r\n\r\nArtur Sargsyan, 30, of Glendale, California, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr., to five years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $458,200. He was also ordered to forfeit $184,768.87. Sargsyan was convicted on these charges on September 1, 2017, after he pleaded guilty.\r\n\r\nThis case was investigated by the FBI.\r\n\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Samir Kaushal and Kamal Ghali prosecuted the case. John Zacharia, formerly the Deputy Chief for Litigation for the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, previously prosecuted the case. The prosecution reflects a coordinated effort by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Department of Justice Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS), the Office of International Affairs, the FBI\u2019s field offices in Atlanta, Denver, Chicago, and Los Angeles, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California. Substantial assistance was provided by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency and the Ministry of Security and Justice in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nFor further information please contact the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Public Affairs Office at USAGAN.PressEmails@usdoj.gov or (404) 581-6016. The Internet address for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia is http://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga.\r\n\r\nVAUGHN Index requested for any materials cited in exemption.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWilliam Fernandes\r\n///////",

        "communication": "Thank you for your inquiry regarding the status of your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy (FOIPA) request.   A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u2018Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u2019 link.  Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 152 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 922 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,964 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,360 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request medium processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is February 2024.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  If you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please indicate so and a representative will be in contact.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. All agency records pertaining to the decision by the Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) for the Middle District of Georgia (MDGa), to decline the recommended prosecution of former CoreCivic employee Freddy Wims for making false statements under oath in connection with the investigation of the death of Jeancarlo Alfonso Jimenez Joseph at the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, GA, on May 15, 2017, including, but not limited to, the Declination Memo created by the USAO MDGa. \r\n\r\n2. All agency records created or reviewed in connection with the following FOIA requests: \"CRM-3006-97176\"; EOUSA-2019-002865; A-2020-01304. \r\n\r\nPlease note the following history of the agency's failure to task an adequate search in response to similar previous requests: \r\nA. First, on May 8, 2019, I requested records from the DOJ Criminal Division pertaining to the declination of prosecution by the USAO for the MDGa. (See: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/doj-records-of-the-dhs-oigs-criminal-investigation-of-jean-jimenezs-death-department-of-justice-criminal-division-72898/#comms). DOJ acknowledged receiving this request on May 22, 2019, and assigned it a tracking number of CRM-3006-97176. In its May 22, 2019, acknowledgement letter, DOJ FOIA requested clarification as to the records requested. I provided the requested clarification the same day, indicating that because prosecution was declined, no case number was publicly available. Consequently, on July 5, 2019, DOJ-CRIM concluded my original request was \"misdirected\" and transferred that request to the Executive Office of United States Attorneys (EOUSA) and informed me it was treating the response as final and the case closed. I did not administratively appeal that determination because it appeared that DOJ-CRIM did not have responsive records, EOUSA did, and that EOUSA would commence a search for these records after it received DOJ-CRIM's intra-agency referral. To the best of my knowledge, I have never received an acknowledgement or individualized tracking number from EOUSA following DOJ-CRIM's July 5, 2019, referral of my May 8, 2019, \"misdirected\" request to EOUSA. \r\n\r\n2. Second, on May 8, 2019, I requested records from the EOUSA (independently from the referral by DOJ-CRIM). That request is available here: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/doj-records-of-the-dhs-oigs-criminal-investigation-of-jean-jimenezs-death-department-of-justice-executive-office-for-united-states-attorneys-72899/. On May 16, 2019, EOUSA acknowledged receipt of this request and assigned it tracking number EOUSA-2019-002865. On July 8, 2019, EOUSA informed me that it had conducted a search of the USAO for the Northern District of Georgia and located no responsive records. I replied on July 17, 2019,  by pointing out that the USAO MDGa had not been searched. EOUSA provided no response. On June 3, 2020, I administratively appealed the constructive denial of my FOIA request, which EOUSA assigned tracking number A-2020-01304. On July 20, 2020, EOUSA denied the appeal, determining it was untimely, because it was not filed within the 90-day period after EOUSA's July 8, 2019 decision. \r\n\r\nBased on the above, a currently-pending referral from DOJ-Crim to EOUSA of my \"misdirected\" request, which DOJ-CRIM initiated no later than July 5, 2019, remains unacknowledged and pending within EOUSA's FOIA files. I seek records responsive to that referral on an expedited basis, given that DOJ FOIA has failed to properly acknowledged the intra-agency transfer for nearly 3 years. \r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me at Andrew@DetentionKills.org if I can provide any clarification or additional information regarding this time-sensitive request. \r\n\r\nI make this request on behalf of the #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative, a project of Al Otro Lado. Its purpose is to inform the public of actual and alleged criminal wrongdoing by government contractors which DOJ officials have declined to prosecute. \r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this time-sensitive matter. \r\n\r\nBest regards, \r\n\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Please retask an adequate search that proceeds iteratively and addresses these positive indicia of overlooked materials. \r\n\r\nThe redactions under Exemption 5 of factual information, such as the acronym \u201cROI\u201d, and the redactions under Exemptions 6 and 7C are not supported by a legal and factual analysis of these records. \r\n\r\nFinally no cognizable foreseeable harm applies to the release of this information. \r\n\r\nYour office previously denied an administrative appeal on the basis that we had been given the 62-page release on October 5, 2022. We messaged you repeatedly because we never received these records. Instead of providing them, you asserted for the first time that they were not released to us, but rather, referred to DHS-OIG. Please reopen our prior appeal and reverse the affirmance. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

This allows us to provide releasable information in a timely manner. Otherwise, the only way to establish whether an investigation is responsive to a specific request is to review each file individually.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUSPS OIG FOIA Team",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Please visit the following link and enter your username and password to access the records: http://cps.edu/About_CPS/Departments/Law/Pages/FOIARequest.aspx . Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including private phone numbers, and private email address. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Redacted is private information and unique identifiers contained within public records that could identify or de-identify a student pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b) and 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) (quoted above). Student records are exempt from disclosure pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5(r) Information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act. Additionally, identifiable student information included within records are exempt from disclosure pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5(r) in accordance with Illinois Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at its direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored. 105 ILCS 10/(d): Release of a minor\u2019s record may only be authorized by the parent or guardian in accordance with the Illinois student Records Act (105 ILCS 10/1 et seq.). Pursuant to 20 U.S. Code \u00a7 1232g (b)(1) and (b)(2)(A): The parent or eligible student shall provide a signed and dated written consent before an educational agency or institution discloses personally identifiable information from the student\u2019s education records, except as provided in \u00a799.31. (b) The written consent must: (1) Specify the records that may be disclosed; (2) State the purpose of the disclosure; and (3) Identify the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure may be made. In case of denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706 . You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500.

At least some of the records I am requesting were previously posted on the Department's website (https://web.archive.org/web/20160530052744/http://labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/wageboard2015.shtm). Although this page has since been removed, I believe that the Department still holds these records. Indeed, I confirmed with the New York State Archives that they have not received any documents relating to the Fast Food Wage Board.\r\n\r\nI ask that you expedite at least the release of the recordings of the 2015 Fast Food Wage Board meetings. Again, these recordings were previously posted on the Department's website, which suggests that they are of considerable interest to the public and do not require any review or redactions by your staff. Your own FOIL guidelines state that the timeline for responding to a request depends on \"the number of documents you request, their format, their availability, the time it takes to redact any information that cannot be disclosed pursuant to FOIL, the time it takes to assemble the documents, and other factors.\" (Quoted from the Process section of https://dol.ny.gov/freedom-information-law-foil-requests). These request-specific factors bely the claim in your extension message that you have an \"obligation to treat each request equally.\" Since the previously public Fast Food Wage Board documents do not need redactions or reformatting, it seems reasonable to expect that you can release them with a minimum of staff time.

The requested records include recordings of\r\npublic hearings and testimony previously available on the DOL website\r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20160530052744/http://labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/wageboard2015.shtm>.\r\nThe\r\ntracking number for my request is R001184-092523.\r\n\r\nI submitted my request on September 25, 2023 but have yet to receive any\r\nrecords or reasonable estimate of when the records will be available\r\n(again). I was initially given an estimate of 20 business days. A month\r\nlater, the estimate was extended by 90 days. After 90 days, it was pushed\r\nback by 30 days. Most recently, I was given another estimate of 90 business\r\ndays. I have attached the full message history related to this request.\r\n\r\nI do not consider the estimates provided to me reasonable under the\r\ncircumstances of the request. It has been over six months since I submitted\r\nmy request and three estimates have expired with no explanation. Please\r\nnote that no redactions or reformatting should be required for records\r\npreviously released in response to Randy Mastro's 2015 FOIL request or\r\npublished to a public webpage. I kindly ask that you provide me with a\r\nreasonable estimate taking into account the nature of my request and the\r\ntime it took the Department to respond to similar recent requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n*Peter Fugiel, PhD* | Postdoctoral Research Fellow\r\n\r\nDepartment of Labor Studies and Employment Relations\r\n\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations\n",

ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(j)(iii) exempts from release information concerning a school or university\u2019s adjudication of student disciplinary cases, but only to the extent that disclosure would unavoidably reveal the identity of the student. \r\nSection 7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for a definitive contract (award ID: HQ003422C0094) awarded to Sancorp Consulting, LLC (UEI: GRYKNJ8BGFC8). This contract has an action date of August 22, 2022, and is funded by the Department of Defense through the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense For Intelligence and Security for support services in the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Correspondence (internal emails, physical mail, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by Sancorp Consulting, LLC\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to work being done by AARO and its contractors. During an April 19, 2023 hearing of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, AARO director Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick stated AARO would need additional authorization from Congress to begin counterintelligence work, but given that Sancorp's contract with AARO started in 2022, prior to that hearing, and Sancorp lists on its website previous work in the field of counterintelligence, there is a possibility AARO may already be engaged in counterintelligence work without Congressional authorization. Sancorp's contract with AARO would help clarify this apparent contradiction.\r\n\r\nThere is no risk of interfering with ongoing operations or disclosure of sensitive materials. Sancorp already lists the contract on their publicly-accessible website: https://www.sancorpconsulting.com/_files/ugd/7aeb19_0c37a59d213b4d68a043ef83b56edc9a.pdf\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Ms. Joo Chung\r\nAssistant to the Secretary of Defense for Privacy\r\nCivil Liberties, and Transparency (PCLT)\r\nOffice of the Secretary of Defense\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn May 21, 2023, I submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552, FOIA case number 23-F-0905, for copies of records for award ID HQ003422C0094. This ID is connected to a contract awarded by Department of Defense through the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense For Intelligence and Security to Sancorp Consulting, LLC (UEI: GRYKNJ8BGFC8) in 2022, for work identified as \u201cAARO SUPPORT SERVICES.\u201d\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\n\r\nOn September 11, 2023, I received a partial response, attached, from Stephanie L. Carr, Chief, Department of Defense (DOD), Freedom of Information Division, stating that the DOD had identified 125 pages of documents responsive to my request, but that it would be releasing only a portion; a file containing 34 pages, labeled 23-F-0905_doc_1.pdf, was attached.\r\n\r\nThe partial response letter also stated: \u201cFinally, Acquisition Directorate conducted an exhaustive search of their records systems for the following: Correspondence (internal emails, physical mail, etc.); Requests for Information; Memorandum(s) of Understanding; Letters of Interest; Task Letters; Privacy Impact Assessments; and, Presentations by Sancorp Consulting, LLC. After thorough searches of their electronic records and files, no records of the subjects were located. In this instance, fees for processing your request were below the threshold for requiring payment. Please note that fees may be assessed on future requests.\u201d\r\n\r\nAPPEAL\r\n\r\nUpon review of the partial response letter, the Acquisition Directorate appears to have overlooked at least one item identified in my original request, which I reproduce in part below:\r\n\r\n\u201c- Correspondence (internal emails, physical mail, etc.)\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n- Award Letters\r\n- Task Letters\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n- Invoices\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n- Presentations by Sancorp Consulting, LLC\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease take note that the Acquisition Directorate\u2019s response jumps from \u201cRequests for Information\u201d to \u201cMemorandums of Understanding.\u201d Missing is an acknowledgement that the Acquisition Directorate did or did not locate records responsive to my request for \u201cStatements of Work\u201d (SOW). Per Acquisition Directorate documents available on the General Services Administration\u2019s website, attached, this item may also be identified as a Performance Work Statement (PWS). Page 4 of a PowerPoint presentation labeled \u201cPWS Writing Tips,\u201d dated April 16, 2014, identifies the SOW and PWS as being synonymous. This information can be found at: https://hallways.cap.gsa.gov/system/files/doclib/april-2015-clemens-pws-presentation-final-1523974380.pdf\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am appealing the partial response because the DOD Acquisition Directorate, in the course of its exhaustive search, could not identify whether it does or does not have an SOW/PWS on record. Given that the Acquisition Directorate has created a separate document identifying best practices for the writing of an SOW/PWS, it should already be familiar with this item and require no additional clarification.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting an additional search for records responsive to my original request. If the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense For Intelligence and Security and the Acquisition Directorate could overlook the SOW/PWS, then it is possible they may have missed other information.\r\n\r\nI am renewing a request for a fee waiver. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to work being completed on behalf of a government agency, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
