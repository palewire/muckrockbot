Gen Wins briefed: \"There was an out of house consortium that was created and there are some alumni who recognizing kind of how fast this thing is moving, they went and got involved in this consortium where they are some cadet athletes, basketball players. There's an agreement on them here. Now there's two other features that are separate from the NIL. There's an Academic Achievement Fund, which we did. Okay. And the Academic Achievement Fund is set up in such a way where if you stay at VMI and you perform academically at a certain level, right, then you would get a sum of money and I'm pretty sure academic achievement was upon graduation. There's a second one that's called the Austin Fund which operates similarly. Okay. And I know that that one is upon graduation you would get this the equivalent of I believe $5,000 a year. Right. For four years. So when you graduate in four years, the Austin fund would get you somewhere about $20,000. You have those, those two arrangements as well, which we are participating in right now. It largely affects only basketball. It largely only affects basketball.\" He also briefed that the budget projection is based on increased ticket sales. He also mentioned \"Jamal\" attended a Keydet Club meeting covering the NIL and consortiuum and has the slides and other materials from that. This FOIA requests \r\n\r\n1. Records showing the struture, operations and policies of the NIL consortiuum Maj. Gen. Wins Mentioned. Again, these records include Keydet Club and Alumni Agencies slides, documents, agreements, and other materials given to him that, as a result, become discloseable Public Records.\r\n2. Records showing the amunt paid out of the Academic Achievement Fund since its creation and THE SOURCE OF THOSE FUNDS (student fees, donors (who?), state funds, etc.).\r\n3. Records showing how much, if anything, cadets are charged or any funds form cadet athletic or other student fees for admission to or their attendence at NCAA Football and NCAA basketball events regardless if these are considered \"tickets\" or not for the past 2 academic years.\r\n\r\n#1 and especially #3 should be readily available and should not take more than the 5 day maximum. I am willing to accept any of these immediately available rather than wait for all records if needed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Peay for his last year as Superintendent and for Maj. Gen. Wins each of his years as Superintendent to include, without limitation, the most current version.\r\n\r\nAccording to the BOV ByLaws: \"It shall define its expectations and set goals for the Superintendent and annually review the Superintendent\u2019s performance with reference to those expectations and goals.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the BOV Statement of Governance: \" It shall define its expectations and set goals for the Superintendent and annually review the Superintendent\u2019s performance with reference to those expectations and goals.\"\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I am NOT asking for the actual performance appraisals of either Gen. Peay or Maj. Gen. Wins by the BOV as those would contain personal information. This is only for the objective criteria approved by the BOV, with when and how it was approved, that established those performance criteria upon which evaluations, bonuses, etc. were acted on.\r\n\r\nI am willing to take incremental fulfillment of this FOIA so, for example,s the expectations and goals the Superintendent was evaluated on in the recent BOV Special Meeting where the BOV voted not to extend his contract should be available immediately.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Tennessee Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nelectronic files on the creation and implementation of the Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods\" a.k.a SCORPION unit from 2021 to 2023. \r\n\r\nThis request includes official documents and files on how the team was constructed and deployed as well as any guidelines, manuals, and instruction documents for officers assigned to the unit. For example, I\u2019d like access to information explaining the squad\u2019s \u201cStandard Operating Procedure\u201d, \u201cMission Statement\u201d, \u201cAssignments\u201d, \u201cLocations of Deployment\u201d, \u201cAccountability\u201d and any other documents and files pertaining to the creation and evaluation of the unit. \r\n\r\nAccording to publicly available information, there are documents explaining the creation of a \u201cnew\u201d unit, as reported by ABC 24 Memphis on July 5, 2024 (Reference link: https://www.localmemphis.com/article/news/local/internal-documents-raise-questions-on-memphis-police-scorpion-unit-cj-davis-statements/522-e4346729-3936-486e-b5cb-4b352e300836) \r\n\r\nAdditionally, publicly available records show that the Memphis Police Department maintains internal \u201cStandard Operating Procedure\u201d documents for specific units, like the 2019 Uniform Patrol Station (Reference link: https://fnolan.com/AO3/UPSSOP_complete.pdf). Therefore, the MPD should have a similar document for the SCORPION unit. \r\n\r\nI would like my above request to be filled in electronic formats (such as .pdf or similar format) whenever possible and if the formats are readily available.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, from 2021 - 2023 when the unit was disbanded,  in an Excel file or similar electronic format, please send the following data points regarding the Scorpion Unit: total officer-involved shootings per year, total arrests per year, and total guns seized per year. In a December 3, 2021 update from former Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland, he shared publicly that the SCORPION unit had made 125 felony arrests and recovered 95 weapons. Therefore, the remaining information should be available (Reference link: https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/TNMEMPHIS/bulletins/2ff2916). \r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $100. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of policing tactics in Portland. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nI request that all future communication be conducted via email or phone call. Whenever possible, I would like the documents that are responsive to my request to be sent through email as well.\r\n\r\nI also request a prompt response to this request. State law requires a seven-business-day response time. If you expect a significant delay in responding to or fulfilling this request, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nPublic records in Tennessee are defined as \u201call documents, papers, letters, maps, books, photographs, microfilms, electronic data processing files and output, films, sound recordings, or other material, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by any governmental entity.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 10-7-503(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKent Hoover, a citizen of Tennessee, in coordination with Josiah Bates.",
