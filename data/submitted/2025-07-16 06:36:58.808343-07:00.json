For the time period of January 1, 2020 to the present, all monthly reports submitted by the Chief of Police to the City Council pursuant to Newburgh City Code \u00a7 80-2, which states that: \r\n\r\n\u201c[t]he Police Chief shall present to the Council at its first regular meeting in each month a report of the operations of the Department during the preceding month, including therein a statement of the number of persons arrested during such month, their sex, the cause of arrest, the number of persons convicted and such other particulars in relation to that Department as he may deem necessary and proper to communicate.\" \r\n\r\nA copy of Newburgh City Code \u00a7 80-2 is available at this link: https://ecode360.com/10870789\r\n\r\n2. Any and all records (whether from the Police Department, City Council, or any other City official, employee, board, office, etc.) reflecting whether the monthly reports required under Newburgh City Code \u00a7 80-2 were ever prepared, transmitted, received, discussed, or requested. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n- Internal and external correspondence concerning such reports;\r\n- Memoranda and emails addressing compliance (or non-compliance) with the reporting obligation under \u00a7 80-2;\r\n- Council meeting agendas, minutes, and summaries referencing the monthly reports or their absence;\r\n- All written policies and practices relating to these reporting obligations;\r\n- Any prior FOIL requests, inquiries, complaints, or responses concerning the same.\r\n\r\n3. All other reports submitted by the Police Department to the City Council during that same period, or submitted by the Police Department to the City Manager for inclusion in the City Manager's reports to the City Council, regardless of the titles of such reports, or their format, subject matter, and/or frequency. This may include, but is not limited to: annual reports, statistical or operational summaries, special reports, presentations, memoranda, and/or briefings.\r\n\r\nThis request is made with the understanding that regular reporting by the Police Department is not merely a bureaucratic formality, but a fundamental legal obligation intended to ensure that the City Council has sufficient information to effectively oversee law enforcement operations and ensure that the City is meeting the public safety needs of its residents, businesses, and other taxpayers. If such reports are not being submitted as required\u2014or if the City is unable to produce meaningful documentation that these reports exist or that similar records are being regularly provided to the Council\u2014it would reflect a serious failure of transparency and governance. This is a matter of vital public importance.\r\n\r\nIf any of the requested records are withheld or redacted, in whole or in part, please specify with particularity the statutory basis for each such claimed exemption and the reasons why each such record or portion thereof is claimed to be exempt from disclosure. If additional information is needed to adequately describe our request, please contact us at liberty@libertystreetlegal.com.\r\n \r\nPlease provide electronic copies of the requested records via email attachment.\r\n \r\nThank you for your time and attention to this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLiberty Street Legal PLLC",
