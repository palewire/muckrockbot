        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nThere are indications the version of the Attorney General's decision in Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018), has been edited since the Attorney General issued it. Accordingly, please produce these records as soon as possible: \r\n \r\nAny correspondence dated between June 10, 2018 and the date this request is processed mentioning \"Matter of A-B-\" for the following custodians: James McHenry, Mary Beth Keller, Anthony Murry, Katherine Reilly, Mary Cheng, Marlene Wahowiak, or Kate Sheehey. \r\n\r\nThis request is explicitly intended to include other forms of correspondence, including paper notes, letters, or memoranda. The attachments to any responsive e-mail messages should also be produced. \r\n\r\nTo clarify my request, I seek all responsive records regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics. In conducting the search, please understand the terms \u201crecord,\u201d \u201cdocument,\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d in their broadest sense, to include any written, typed, recorded, graphic, printed, or audio material of any kind. We seek records of any kind, including electronic records, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs, as well as letters, emails, facsimiles, telephone messages, voice mail messages and transcripts, notes, or minutes of any meetings, telephone conversations or discussions. My request includes any attachments to these records, including e-mail attachments. No category of material should be omitted from search, collection, and production.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business. You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, 827 F.3d 145, 149\u201350 (D.C. Cir. 2016); cf. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Kerry, 844 F.3d 952, 955\u201356 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\r\n\r\nIt is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, No. 14-cv-765, slip op. at 8 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2016).\r\n\r\nIn addition, please note that in conducting a \u201creasonable search\u201d as required by law, you must employ the most up-to-date technologies and tools available, in addition to searches by individual custodians likely to have responsive information. Recent technology may have rendered DHS\u2019s prior FOIA practices unreasonable. In light of the government-wide requirements to manage information electronically by the end of 2016, it is no longer reasonable to rely exclusively on custodian-driven searches. Presidential Memorandum\u2014Managing Government Records, 76 Fed. Reg. 75,423 (Nov. 28, 2011), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/28/presidentialmemorandum-managing-government-records; Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments & Independent Agencies, \u201cManaging Government Records Directive,\u201d M-12-18 (Aug. 24, 2012), https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/m-12-18.pdf.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, agencies that have adopted the National Archives and Records Agency (NARA) Capstone program, or similar policies, now maintain emails in a form that is reasonably likely to be more complete than individual custodians\u2019 files. For example, a custodian may have deleted a responsive email from his or her email program, but DHS\u2019s archiving tools would capture that email under Capstone. Accordingly, I insist that the USCIS use the most up-to-date technologies to search for responsive information and take steps to ensure that the most complete repositories of information are searched. I am available to work with you to craft appropriate search terms.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1974). The index must describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity \u201cto permit a reasoned judgment as to whether the material is actually exempt under FOIA.\u201d Founding Church of Scientology v. Bell, 603 F.2d 945, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Moreover, the index \u201cmust describe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of disclosing the sought-after information.\u201d King v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 223\u201324 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Further, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d Id. at 224 (citing Mead Data Central, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).\r\n\r\nIn the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records. If it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Mead Data Central, 566 F.2d at 261. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including prompt litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the USCIS is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable. To ensure that this request is properly construed, that searches are conducted in an adequate but efficient manner, and that extraneous costs are not incurred, I welcome an opportunity to discuss this request with you before you undertake your search or incur search or duplication costs. By working together at the outset, we can decrease the likelihood of costly and time-consuming litigation in the future. If it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request: \r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k), I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this request for records. The subject of this request concerns the operations of the federal government, and the disclosures will likely contribute to a better understanding of relevant government procedures by the general public in a significant way. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the request is entirely and fundamentally for non-commercial purposes. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(ii).\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested information is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i); see also 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv). The Attorney General's decision rewrote asylum law and made it incredibly difficult for asylum applicants to succeed. In doing so, the Attorney General also expressed an opinion about the eligibility for asylum for a large swath of applicants unrelated to the claim in Matter of A-B-. The decision has already had a substantial effect on asylum approval rates nationwide. \r\n\r\nI am also a member of the news media and have written and researched immigration court practice and procedures, including specifically developments in docketing procedures since the change in administration, and I request that all search and production fees be waived due to my news media status. See e.g. https://www.law360.com/articles/1050952/foia-documents-shed-light-on-eoir-case-management (referencing my writing and research on docketing procedure changes); https://www.aila.org/infonet/eoir-foia-response-no-dark-courtrooms-policy (same); https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/scanning-immigrants-old-fingerprints-us-threatens-to-strip-thousands-of-citizenship/2018/06/13/2230d8a2-6f2e-11e8-afd5-778aca903bbe_story.html?utm_term=.c59c400f0ef7 (referencing my research and writing on denaturalization procedures); https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/us-may-strip-citizenship-cheats-of-their-passports-lwt7kddq0 (same); http://www.recorder.com/US-goes-after-naturalized-immigrants-with-criminal-records-18780878 (same). I am quoted in a number of the articles listed above and intend to use the documents and information received in response to this request to share with the public and to write related news articles about immigration enforcement efforts.\r\n\r\nExpedite Request: \r\nPursuant to 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1) I am requesting the processing and production of records in response to this request be expedited. In particular, directions from EOIR administrative staff controlling the decisions Immigration Judges are to enter is of extreme importance, because it implicates issues of due process and fair play in all pending removal proceedings.  Finally, as outlined above, this is a matter of \"widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" For all such reasons, the agency should expedite its request and produce the requested records at once.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMatthew Hoppock\n\n",

Additionally, I'd like to obtain all materials submitted by Blue Star NBR and Blue Star AGI in their submission for the contract.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n               Your case has been assigned case number 2023-00211-F.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n               Based on the information you have requested, we placed your request in the Complex processing track. A complex request can take substantial time and cause significant impact on responding units. Complications and delays are likely. Records sought are massive in volume. Multiple organizations must review/coordinate on requested records. Records are classified; originated with a nongovernment source; are part of the Air Force\u2019s decision-making process; or are privileged. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n               We estimate we will provide a response to your request within 30 working days. Our policy is to process requests within their respective tracks in the order in which we receive them. FOIA requests are processed as quickly as possible. We will advise you if we cannot provide a response within the FOIA statutory timeline.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n                We have placed you in the \"Commercial\" Fee category for processing.  Under this category, you may be charged for all search, review and duplication (paper) costs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDue to the stipulation of the FOIA publication, DODR 5400.7/AFMAN 33-302, we must inquire if you are willing to accept a clearly releasable copy of the requested record(s).  A clearly releasable copy is one which can contain redactions, should it be determined some of the record(s) or portions thereof are not clearly releasable.  In requesting a contract or contract-related documents, please advise whether you will accept a redacted format that removes all trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information before being released {Information of individuals is redacted to protect personal information that, if released, would constitute clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, information from third party submitters is redacted to protect trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential from unauthorized release}, or any information that falls under the 9 exemptions or contains privacy information, i.e. names.  The redacted portions (if any) of responsive documents are removed without listing the exemption codes. This process does not require IDA approval or legal review and will be considered a full release.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso, I just want to inform you a clearly releasable copy,:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n             -You will not get an official denial letter from the Initial Denial Authority (Thus, taking less time).\r\n\r\n             -Responsive Records will be redacted of all personal names.\r\n\r\n             -Responsive Record redactions will have no FOIA Exemption code.\r\n\r\n             -You will not have appeal rights; however, you may submit a new request for ALL the records not agreeing to CLEARLY RELEASABLE responsive records.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease respond to us by COB 16 November 2022 and advise of your willingness to accept a clearly releasable copy and clarification on the requested information or the request will be Administratively Closed for failure to respond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBernice Winn\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBase FOIA/Privacy Manager\r\n\r\n78 ABW/SCPDK\r\n\r\n205 Perry Street, Ste 100\r\n\r\nRAFB, GA 31098\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDSN 468-2875, COMM 478-926-2875\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n***Currently teleworking.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Dear Public Records Custodian,\r\n\r\nThis is a request for public records under the California Public Records Act (CPRA).\r\n\r\nUnder SB 978, a law passed in 2018, \"each local law enforcement agency shall conspicuously post on their Internet Web sites all current standards, policies, practices, operating procedures, and education and training materials that would otherwise be available to the public if a request was made pursuant to the California Public Records Act.\"* I was unable to locate the Stockton Unified School District Police Department documents on its website. \r\n\r\nPursuant to CPRA, I request the following records: \r\n\r\nAll current standards, policies, practices, operating procedures, and education and training materials in use by the Stockton Unified School District Police Department\r\n\r\nIf these records are already available online, please provide me with the direct links to them. Otherwise, I would prefer these records in an electronic format. \r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10.  However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of police practices. As the Senate Rules Committee wrote in its May 26, 2018 floor analysis**: \r\n\r\n\"Making regulations of law enforcement agencies easily accessible to the public helps educate the public about law enforcement policies, practices, and procedures, increases communication and community trust, and enhances transparency while saving costs and labor associated with responding to individual requests for this information.\"\r\n\r\nThis information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe California Public Records Act requires a response within 10 business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nI can be reached via email at the email address listed on this request.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nStanford University Libraries\r\n\r\nRelevant links\r\n* https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=13650\r\n\r\n* * https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB978#",

This could also apply to oil companies incorporated abroad, such as UK-based GulfSands, which recently reiterated its intention to protect its rights over oil fields in Syria [https://syrianobserver.com/EN/features/60493/british-company-concerned-over-its-oil-rights-in-northeastern-syria.html].\r\n\r\n- Any and all all active licenses to engage in transactions related to petroleum, gas or petroleum products of Syrian origin as of October 8, 2020. In particular, we would like to obtain a copy of OFAC Lic.# SY-2019-363130, which was reportedly granted to Delta Crescent Energy. There have also been unconfirmed reports (https://al-akhbar.com/ArticleFiles/20197151112056636987498800565178.pdf; https://taskandpurpose.com/news/trump-syria-oil-production) about Moti Kahana's Global Development Corporation (GDC) having been nominated by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Council (SDC) to represent it in oil sales in January 2019. Please provide us with a copy of licences issued to GDC or request for licences submitted by the company (if any). \r\n\r\nIn October 2017, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) took control of Al-Omar oil field in Deyr al-Zour Province, which is the largest oil field in Syria. Since then there have been multiple reports about purported oil deals between US companies and the Kurdish-led administration.  \r\n\r\nAs SyriaUntold (www.syriauntold.com), a European Endowment for Democracy (EED)-funded Syria-focused journalistic platform, we are seeking expedited processing of our request pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) because not doing so \"could reasonably be expected to pose a threat to the life or physical safety of an individual\". In particular, a wave of assassinations have targeted Arab tribal leaders in the last months in eastern Syria, in an escalation that could be linked to undisclosed details of the aforementioned deal with Delta Crescent Energy. The announcement of this purported deal, whose details are still obscure, have prompted the Syrian Democratic Forces' regional competitors (Turkey and the Syrian government) to condemn it. All these players are likely to ramp up hostile activities against the Kurdish-led administration by mobilising segments of the population who feel excluded from the beneficiaries of a deal signed behind closed doors. Hence, the importance of transparency and of our investigataion on oil deals, in order to inform Syrian and international audiences.  \r\n\r\nThe Syrian public has an urgent need to understand a deal that concerns the future of their country's natural resources, and to identify the beneficiaries of such agreement. Especially since officials of the Kurdish-led administration have not commented officially on this, with some even questioning the existence of an actual deal (https://syriafiles.net/en/dirar-to-syria-files-sdf-not-authorized-to-sign-oil-contracts-russia-is-assads-guarantor/). \r\n\r\nWe are a group of international and Syrian journalists working on this story, and we are requesting this information in that editorial capacity. The outcome of this work will be published in English and Arabic, and shared across multiple platforms on traditional and social media. SyriaUntold has collaborated with several other regional and international media platforms, including OpenDemocracy, the Network of Iraqi Reporters for Investigative Journalism, Pan Arab Al-Hayat newspaper and UPI press agency. According to a 2017 study published by the SKeyes Center for Media and Cultural Freedom at the Samir Kassir Foundation, SyriaUntold stood out as one of the most accurate Syrian outlets for its attention to multiple sourcing in its stories. In addition to expedited processing, we request to be properly classified as a news media requester.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about our media status, please contact us.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Please be advised that our review and redaction of records responsive to FOIA requests are not arbitrary and capricious. On the contrary, they are conducted an made in accordance with the applicable laws at the time. Your request is for applications and licenses granted from October 1, 2017 to October 8, 2020 for authorization to engage in transactions related to petroleum, gas or petroleum products of Syrian origin. As we indicated in our acknowledgement letter to you, dated October 22, 2020, this requires us to process the records through the Treasury submitter notice process found at 31 C.F.R.\u00a71.5.\r\n\r\nUpon the completion of that process and in accordance with 5 U.S.C.\u00a7552(a)(8)(A) we withhold information under this section only if;\r\n\r\n(I) the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b)[5 U.S.C\u00a7552]; or\r\n(II) disclosure is prohibited by law.\r\n\r\nOFAC followed this same process when we processed Mr. Kopplin\u2019s request and released to him those records and information that were not exempt from release under the FOIA. We withheld only that information and records that was exemption under the FOIA. We therefore cannot now disclose more information to you because properly and legally redacted records do not suit your purpose.\r\n\r\nAs we also indicated to you in our October 22, 2020 letter, we generally process our cases on a first-in, first-out basis. There are currently 275 cases ahead of your request in our queue. Because of the deleterious effects of Covid-19 our processing time has been negatively affected. We cannot at this time provide you with a date certain when we can provide you with a further response to your request. But we will work as diligently as we can to get to your request.\r\n\r\nSince the records have been processed and they are also responsive to your request we will provide your with the records that we sent to Mr. Kopplin in FOIA case 2020-06-162. Please consider this as a first interim response to your request.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that OFAC has conducted a search of its records and found 134 pages of responsive material. Of these 134 pages, 98 pages are being withheld in full pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(4) and (b)(6). We are releasing 16 pages of records with redactions made. in part, pursuant to exemptions (b)(4) and (b)(6) of the FOIA, with the remaining 20 pages being released in full.\r\n\r\nFOIA exemption (b)(4) protects from disclosure \u201ctrade secrets and commercial and financial information obtained from a person, including companies, [that is] privileged or confidential.\u201d The recent Supreme Court decision in Food Marketing held that information is confidential within the meaning of exemption (b)(4) when it is customarily and actually treated as private by its owner. In other words, the information is not customarily disseminated to the public. See Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U.S. (2019). OFAC used this exemption to withhold confidential business information.\r\n\r\nFOIA exemption (b)(6) protects from disclosure personal privacy information, the release of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. OFAC used a balancing test to determine that the individuals\u2019 right to personal privacy outweighed the public\u2019s right to release of the information. OFAC withheld information such as names of individuals, signatures, addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, and email addresses.\r\n\r\nWhen your case comes up in our queue, we will continue to process the records that are responsive to your request until all responsive records are processed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us at our FOIA Requester Service Center by way of telephone to: 202-622-2500, Option 3, or by email to the OFACFOIAOffice@treasury.gov<mailto:OFACFOIAOffice@treasury.gov>.

(See what some international law experts are saying on this issue https://newrepublic.com/article/158841/pompeo-trump-steal-oil-kurds-syria-iraq). It is therefore necessary to understand in details who are the Syrian signatories of the deal with Delta Crescent. \r\n\r\nPart of the export plans discussed by Delta Crescent Energy in the Kurdistan Regional Government seem to imply the use of pipelines jointly owned by Turkey and Iraq without consulting all the concerned parties. Major international legal issues could arise from this oil deal. This is one of the reasons why we pursue a full disclosure of the export route, business entities mentioned in the OFAC licence.\r\n\r\nNot without mentioning all the middlemen, smugglers who reap profits from the Syrian oil business in a war economy. The public needs to know whether Delta Crescent Energy is engaging with certain entities in both Syria and KRG. Releasing more details of the OFAC licence would definitely serve this purpose. \r\n\r\nWe also request full disclosure of the OFAC licence applications submitted by Moti Kahana and Mashriq Analytics and Consulting Llc, and of the documents related to any other applicant and issued between October 1, 2017 and May 6, 2021. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your cooperation.",

        "communication": "Dear all,\r\n\r\nOn August 11 we received the following letter explaining why our appeal had been turned down (see below for public records). Although our request to know more about the activities of Delta Crescent LLC in Syria was rejected on \"privacy\" grounds, we reiterate our interest in obtaining all OFAC records related to other applicants, as expressed in our initial request. If possible, we would also like to update our request to include applications submitted until today, 9 September 2021. Thanks for your cooperation. \r\n\r\n \r\n   August 11, 2021  FOIA No.:  2021-FOIA-00017 OASIS No.:  1149705  Roberta Pasini SyriaUntold DEPT MR 103307 411A Highland Ave. Somerville, MA 02144 \r\n\r\n     \r\nRE:  FOIA Appeal No. 2021-FOIA-00017A \r\n Dear Ms. Pasini:   This responds to your Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d) appeal dated June 1, 2021 and \r\nreceived July 14, 2021 of the Office of Foreign Assets Control\u2019s (\u201cOFAC\u201d or \u201cAgency\u201d) \r\nFebruary 4, 2021 first interim response to your March 19, 2021 FOIA request (2021-FOIA-\r\n00017) (the \u201cRequest\u201d).  The above-referenced request was made on behalf SyriaUntold.  The FOIA requires that where information is deleted from a record pursuant to an exemption, the \r\nexemption under which the deletion is made shall be indicated on the released portion of the \r\nrecord, unless indicating the exemption would harm an interest protected by the exemption.1  As \r\nrelevant here, OFAC\u2019s first interim response to the Request included documents with \r\ninformation redacted or withheld pursuant to FOIA Exemptions (b)(4) and (b)(6).  Although you \r\ndo not identify the grounds on which the appeal rests \u2014 and although OFAC\u2019s processing of \r\nyour request remains ongoing \u2014 your submission appears to challenge OFAC\u2019s assertion of \r\nthese exemptions in the files provided as part of OFAC\u2019s first interim response to the Request.  Exemption (b)(4) protects \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from \r\na person [that is] privileged or confidential.\u201d2  For purposes of this exemption, courts treat \r\ninformation as \u201cconfidential\u201d when the information is \u201ccustomarily kept private, or at least \r\nclosely held\u201d by the submitter.\u201d3  Courts also consider whether the government has provided \r\n\u201csome assurance\u201d that the information will not be disclosed.4  I conclude that OFAC properly asserted Exemption (b)(4) in this instance.  Your appeal argues \r\nthat OFAC should have revealed \u201cmore details\u201d about Delta Crescent Energy, LLC\u2019s license \r\napplication so it could identify the Syrian signatories to the transaction at issue in the application.  \r\nThis argument does not address the propriety of OFAC\u2019s assertion of Exemption (b)(4), i.e., the \r\nsensitivity and privacy of information withheld or redacted in OFAC\u2019s first interim response.   1 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). 2 Id. \u00a7 552(b)(4). 3 Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, 139 S. Ct. 2356, 2363 (2019). 4 Id. \r\nIrrespective of this deficiency, a careful review of OFAC\u2019s first interim response reveals that the \r\ninformation withheld or redacted pursuant to Exemption (b)(4) relates to commercial or financial \r\ninformation about Delta Crescent Energy, LLC and its parent companies that is sensitive and/or \r\nconfidential in nature.    Therefore, I deny your appeal to the extent it challenges OFAC\u2019s Exemption (b)(4) assertions \r\nover portions of the Agency\u2019s first interim response.  Exemption (b)(6) protects information about individuals in \u201cpersonnel and medical files and \r\nsimilar files\u201d when the disclosure of such information \u201cwould constitute a clearly unwarranted \r\ninvasion of personal privacy.\u201d5  In assessing agencies\u2019 assertions of Exemption (b)(6), courts \r\nhave held that an agency should: (1) determine whether the information at issue is a personnel, \r\nmedical or \u201csimilar\u201d file; (2) determine whether a personal privacy interest is involved; \r\n(3) determine whether a public interest in disclosure is involved and qualifies for consideration; \r\nand (4) balance the personal privacy interest against any qualifying public interest.6  I conclude that OFAC properly asserted Exemption (b)(6) in this instance.  Your arguments \r\nrelate exclusively to the third prong of this analysis, i.e., that OFAC should release \u201cmore \r\ndetails\u201d about Delta Crescent Energy, LLC\u2019s license \u2014 namely, the \u201cSyrian signatories to the \r\ndeal with Delta Crescent\u201d \u2014 because \u201cthe public needs to know\u201d whether these engagements \r\n\u201cviolat[e] international law.\u201d  But your appeal neither discusses the personal privacy interest \r\nimplicated by the potential release this information nor balances these personal privacy interests \r\nagainst the claimed public interest.    Even so, I conclude that OFAC\u2019s assertion of Exemption (b)(6) satisfies each step of the required \r\nanalysis.  A careful review of the records produced to SyriaUntold shows that OFAC asserted \r\nExemption (b)(6) over information relating to names, signatures, addresses, birth dates, \r\ngovernment identification numbers, telephone numbers, and email addresses of Delta Crescent \r\nEnergy, LLC\u2019s employees and business partners.  This information implicates a \u201csubstantial\u201d \r\nprivacy interest under FOIA that is not outweighed by the public interest concerns you allude to \r\nin the appeal.7  Therefore, I deny your appeal to the extent it challenges OFAC\u2019s Exemption (b)(6) assertions \r\nover portions of the Agency\u2019s first interim response.  Judicial review of my decision is available in the district court of the United States in the district \r\nin which you reside or have a principal place of business, in which the agency records are \r\nsituated, or in the District of Columbia, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).

This request includes but is not limited to inter-departmental communications, situational reports, bulletins and other documents.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This request includes but is not limited to inter-departmental communications, situational reports, bulletins and other documents.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 6254(b); 6254(c); 6254(f); 6254(k); and 6255.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, the Department is in the process of identifying records responsive to your request.

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requester,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience. We have completed our review of your request to the Los Angeles Police Department (\u201cLAPD\u201d or \u201cDepartment\u201d) under the California Public Records Act (Cal. Govt. Code section 6250, et seq., hereinafter the \u201cCPRA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u201c\u2026Records regarding the potential for violence, unrest, criminal activities or other disturbances associated with protests or other activities on either January 5 or January 6, 2021 at local, regional or national events. This request includes but is not limited to inter-departmental communications, situational reports, bulletins and other documents.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department has conducted a search and identified records responsive to your request. Pursuant to the Government Code Sections 6254(K) and 6255, responsive records are provided to you with redactions. Section 6254(k) exempts records which are exempt from disclosure under federal or state law, including but not limited to provisions of the Evidence Code relating to privilege. Evidence Code Section 1040 declares an official information privilege for information acquired in confidence by a public agency when the public interest in disclosing the information is outweighed by the public interest in keeping the information confidential. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6255 exempts from disclosure records and information when \u201cthe public interest served by not disclosing the record and/or information, clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.\u201d\u00a0The Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the analysis and evaluation of the techniques, procedures, tactics and security used by the Department. Disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to endanger the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public in the event of a similar law enforcement initiative in a future occurrence. Furthermore, additional redactions have been applied in accordance with the California Government Code, Section 6254(f), which exempts from disclosure records of investigations conducted by, or investigatory files compiled by, any local police agency for law enforcement purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you again for your patience.\u00a0If you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

However, please note that certain requests may take longer to process due to the size of the records requested or current request volumes. Your request has been given the following reference number W022251-062322 for tracking purposes. \r\n\r\nRecord Requested: To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\n    Pursuant to the Tennessee Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n    Records regarding the potential for violence, unrest, criminal activities or other disturbances associated with protests or other activities on either January 5 or January 6, 2021 at local, regional or national events. This request includes but is not limited to inter-departmental communications, situational reports, bulletins and other documents.\r\n\r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. \r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nThis request is filed by Kent Hoover, a citizen of Memphis, in coordination with Emma North-Best. \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fmemphis-police-department-652%252F2021-united-states-capitol-attack-and-other-protests-memphis-police-department-118269%252F%253Femail%253DAnita.Escalante%252540memphistn.gov&url_auth_token=AAAj6AxQFvY8HiK_LF64jMPqWOk%3A1o4Qc2%3AEgmL9szxtG3BfeHYTb70cPPVVmomXdr9xOEBWnu8zJ8\u201d \r\nIn response to your records request, our office is taking the following action(s). It is not practicable for the records you requested to be made promptly available for inspection and/or copying because: The office is still in the process of retrieving, reviewing, and/or redacting the requested records. \r\nThe time reasonably necessary to produce the record(s) or information and/or to make a determination of a proper response to your request is: JANUARY 18, 2023. \r\nSincerely, \r\nPublic Records Office \r\nCity of Memphis",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Musgrave:\r\n\r\nThis responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for a copy\r\nof DODIG-2016-098, Evaluation of Foreign Officer Involvement at the United\r\nStates Special Operations Command.  We received your request on May 16, 2017\r\nand assigned it case number DODOIG-2017-000595.\r\n\r\n\tThe Evaluations component conducted a search and located records\r\nresponsive to your request.  In coordination with U.S. Special Operations\r\nCommand (USSOCOM) and the Office of Secretary of Defense/Joint Staff, we\r\ndetermined that the attached report, totaling 144 pages, is appropriate for\r\nrelease in part pursuant to the following FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) exemptions: \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(1), which pertains to information that is currently and properly\r\nclassified pursuant to Executive Order 13526, sections: \r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(a), military plans, weapon systems, or operations; \r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(d), foreign relations or foreign activities of the\r\nUnited States, including confidential sources;\r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(g), vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems,\r\ninstallations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services\r\nrelating to the national security; and\r\n\r\n\to\t1.7(e), compilations of items of information that are\r\nindividually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information\r\nreveals an additional association or relationship that: (1) meets the\r\nstandards for classification under this order; and (2) is not otherwise\r\nrevealed in the individual items of information. \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(3), which pertains to information exempted from release by\r\nstatute, in this instance, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130(b) \u0096 Personally identifiable\r\ninformation pertaining to members of the armed forces assigned to \"routinely\r\ndeployable unit[s]\" and certain employees of DOD and DHS. \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(5), which protects privileged communications within or between\r\nagencies, including those protected by the deliberative process privilege.\r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(6), which pertains to information, the release of which would\r\nconstitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. \r\n\r\nOur review included consideration of the foreseeable harm standard, as\r\nstated in DoDM 5400.07.  Under this standard, the content of a particular\r\nrecord should be reviewed and a determination made as to whether the DoD\r\nComponent reasonably foresees that disclosing it, given its age, content,\r\nand character, would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this an adverse determination, you may submit an appeal.\r\nYour appeal, if any, must be postmarked within 90 days of the date of this\r\nletter, clearly identify the determination that you would like to appeal,\r\nand reference to the FOIA case number above.  Send your appeal to the\r\nDepartment of Defense, Office of Inspector General, ATTN: FOIA Appellate\r\nAuthority, Suite 10B24, 4800 Mark Center Drive, Alexandria, VA 22350-1500,\r\nor via facsimile to 571-372-7498.  Please note that FOIA appeals can only\r\nexamine adverse determinations concerning the FOIA process.  For more\r\ninformation on appellate matters and administrative appeal procedures,\r\nplease refer to 32 C.F.R. Sec. 286.9(e) and 286.11(a).  \r\n\r\nYou may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at FOIAPublicLiaison@dodig.mil, or\r\nby calling 703-604-9785, for any further assistance with your request.\r\nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services\r\n(OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about\r\nthe FOIA mediation services they offer.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Musgrave:\r\n\r\nThis responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for a copy\r\nof DODIG-2016-098, Evaluation of Foreign Officer Involvement at the United\r\nStates Special Operations Command.  We received your request on June 24,\r\n2016, and assigned it case number FOIA-2016-00787.\r\n\r\n\tThe Evaluations component conducted a search and located records\r\nresponsive to your request.  In coordination with U.S. Special Operations\r\nCommand (USSOCOM) and the Office of Secretary of Defense/Joint Staff, we\r\ndetermined that the attached report, totaling 144 pages, is appropriate for\r\nrelease in part pursuant to the following FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) exemptions: \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(1), which pertains to information that is currently and properly\r\nclassified pursuant to Executive Order 13526, sections: \r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(a), military plans, weapon systems, or operations; \r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(d), foreign relations or foreign activities of the\r\nUnited States, including confidential sources;\r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(g), vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems,\r\ninstallations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services\r\nrelating to the national security; and\r\n\r\n\to\t1.7(e), compilations of items of information that are\r\nindividually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information\r\nreveals an additional association or relationship that: (1) meets the\r\nstandards for classification under this order; and (2) is not otherwise\r\nrevealed in the individual items of information. \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(3), which pertains to information exempted from release by\r\nstatute, in this instance, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130(b) \u0096 Personally identifiable\r\ninformation pertaining to members of the armed forces assigned to \"routinely\r\ndeployable unit[s]\" and certain employees of DOD and DHS. \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(5), which protects privileged communications within or between\r\nagencies, including those protected by the deliberative process privilege.\r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(6), which pertains to information, the release of which would\r\nconstitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. \r\n\r\nOur review included consideration of the foreseeable harm standard, as\r\nstated in DoDM 5400.07.  Under this standard, the content of a particular\r\nrecord should be reviewed and a determination made as to whether the DoD\r\nComponent reasonably foresees that disclosing it, given its age, content,\r\nand character, would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this an adverse determination, you may submit an appeal.\r\nYour appeal, if any, must be postmarked within 90 days of the date of this\r\nletter, clearly identify the determination that you would like to appeal,\r\nand reference to the FOIA case number above.  Send your appeal to the\r\nDepartment of Defense, Office of Inspector General, ATTN: FOIA Appellate\r\nAuthority, Suite 10B24, 4800 Mark Center Drive, Alexandria, VA 22350-1500,\r\nor via facsimile to 571-372-7498.

The training materials are utilized within the Unified Court System only, by an account and password for personnel. They generally consist of materials drafted by Judges, legal staff of Judges, agencies, institutions, and private organizations and fall within the intra/inter agency exemption to FOIL, where they consist of subjective materials, research, opinions, advice, and analysis of the personnel, staff, agencies, institutions, and private organizations presented for discussion purposes. The discussion materials do not reflect final policy decisions, nor constitute final instructions to staff. Rather they reflect the subjective views, analysis, research, opinions, and recommendations of the author/presenter, to assist in a discussion and deliberation of the topics.\r\n\r\nTo the extent the materials also may provide insight into the deliberative and analytical processes of the Judges, the materials would be privileged.  See \u00a7 87(2)(a); CPLR \u00a7 3101(b).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, they may reflect protecting privileged communications or work product of attorneys and would be exempt under Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(a); CPLR \u00a7 3101(b), (c); CPLR \u00a7 4503.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, please note that the Subject Matter List is a current list of records, by subject matter, that are maintained by this agency.

DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G.

Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format.

In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format.

See A Guide to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, p. 32, n.115.\u00a0 It is expected that a custodian of records must use her superior knowledge of her records with respect to responses to public records requests.\u00a0 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u00a0 Specifically, you stated: \r\nTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M.

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken.

This is an opportunity to\r\nreview the project goals and ask any questions about the RFP. \r\n\r\nThe pre-proposal meeting will be held remotely over Zoom. Please follow\r\nthis Link\r\n\r\nto join the Zoom meeting.

This grant will help the\r\nCity to:\r\n\r\n* Develop regulations or procedures to expedite approvals for a\r\nsignificant portion of development proposals. This includes a separate,\r\nnon-discretionary permit review of projects that are consistent with the\r\nCity of Oakland's General Plan and Planning Code.\r\n\r\n* Prepare Objective Design Standards to streamline processing for a\r\nvariety of proposals, especially affordable housing and projects near\r\nBART and along major transit corridors.\r\n\r\nThe objective design standards will be applied broadly to projects\r\nconsisting of a wide array of building types throughout the City of\r\nOakland. Creation of the objective design standards for\r\nnon-housing-related projects will come from a separate funding source.\r\n\r\nThe desired consultant team will include one or more multi-disciplinary\r\nplanning and design firm(s) with expertise in the following areas:\r\ndeveloping objective design standards in ethnically, linguistically and\r\nculturally diverse communities; creating programs and processes that\r\nexpedite project review; practicing historic preservation planning; and\r\nengaging the local community and stakeholders in a participatory\r\nplanning process. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease visit Objective Design Standards website\r\nfor more\r\ninformation about the RFP and the project.\r\n\r\nDEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Friday, November 19, 2021 by 2:00 pm PST via iSupplier\r\n\r\nNOTE: Interested consultants must Register with iSupplier\r\n(the City\r\nof Oakland's procurement portal) to submit a proposal. \r\n\r\nInterested in partnership opportunities?\r\nFill out our Expression of Interest form\r\n\r\nto be identified as a firm interested in collaborating with other\r\nfirm(s) and to download the RFP.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Moreover, investigative records of a government agency relating to the suspension, firing, or investigation of complaints against a public employee are subject to the Act\u2019s disclosure requirements 10 days after the investigative record is submitted to the agency for action or the investigation is otherwise concluded or terminated.\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, we ask that you cite in writing the specific statutory exemption upon which you have relied, as required by law. We also ask that you release all separate portions of otherwise exempt material.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The City has resolved the technical issues and is releasing the records related to previously provided information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the City has identified the following exemptions for redactions. Redactions have been applied to the records in accordance with Government Code section 7929.210, subdivision (a), and Government Code section 7922.000, as the release of such information would render the City\u2019s information technology system vulnerable to potential attack and, therefore, the public interest served by not disclosing the information clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7929.210, subd., (a); Gov. Code, \u00a7 7322.000.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCity Clerk, Jennifer Woodworth, is the party responsible for asserting the exemptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis completes the City\u2019s response to your records request, and we will consider this matter closed.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* PRA 22-173 Documents for Production (01015200x7AD00).PDF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Hollister.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",
