        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo: FOIA Officer, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nCC: FOIA Officer, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\nSubject: FOIA Request for NPI Numbers and Provider Information under Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program\r\nDear FOIA Officers,\r\nPursuant to the Connecticut Freedom of Information Act (C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 to 1-242) and the Federal Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), I am requesting access to records containing the National Provider Identifier (NPI) numbers and provider information for all entities approved to deliver services under Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) Waiver Program. This request is submitted to both the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure a full and accurate compilation of records related to the Medicaid ABI Waiver providers.\r\nScope of Request\r\n1.\tProvider Information for Medicaid ABI Waiver Program:\r\no\tA complete list of NPI numbers, along with corresponding provider names and addresses, for all entities authorized under Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid ABI Waiver Program. This includes all providers in the Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Approved Provider Registry managed by DSS and recognized by CMS.\r\n2.\tProvider Registry Documentation:\r\no\tAny official registries, directories, or databases maintained by CMS or DSS that list the approved ABI Waiver providers and their associated NPI numbers.\r\n\r\nPurpose and Public Interest Justification\r\nThe requested information is essential to support transparency, public accountability, and accessibility in Medicaid-funded services. Access to these records will enable stakeholders and beneficiaries to verify approved providers, ensuring that taxpayer-funded services are administered equitably and with oversight. This request serves the public interest by facilitating oversight of Medicaid resources and supporting beneficiaries in making informed provider choices.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for Request\r\nThis request is supported by state and federal laws governing public access to records and ensuring Medicaid program transparency:\r\n\u2022\tConnecticut Freedom of Information Act (C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 to 1-242): Provides public access to state-held records, including Medicaid-related data.\r\n\u2022\tConnecticut Public Records Law (Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210): Requires prompt access to public agency records, ensuring transparency for taxpayer-funded programs.\r\n\u2022\tFreedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552): Governs access to federal records, ensuring transparency and accountability for CMS-administered programs.\r\n\u2022\tSocial Security Act \u2013 Title XIX (Medicaid) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.): Mandates federal and state oversight of Medicaid-funded programs.\r\n\u2022\tConnecticut Non-Discrimination Law (Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 46a-58(a)), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794): Require that individuals with disabilities receive accommodations for full access to information, ensuring compliance in FOIA processes.\r\n\r\nDisability and Accessibility Accommodations\r\nIn accordance with ADA and Section 504 requirements, please apply the following accommodations to ensure my full access to these records:\r\n1.\tEmail-Only Communication:\r\no\tAll responses, updates, and records should be sent exclusively via email to AabiWR@live.com. No physical mail, phone calls, portal-based communications, external links, or alternative platforms are permitted.\r\n2.\tElectronic and Accessible Format:\r\no\tProvide all documents in accessible electronic formats (e.g., PDFs compatible with screen readers).\r\n3.\tComplete Documentation:\r\no\tProvide all records without redactions unless legally required. For any necessary redactions, cite the specific legal exemption applied and include a summary.\r\n4.\tDetailed Explanations for Any Denials:\r\no\tIf any portion of this request is denied, provide a clear and detailed explanation for each denied item, citing relevant statutes or exemptions.\r\n5.\tGuidance for Complex Records:\r\no\tFor records containing complex financial, legal, or procedural language, please include summaries or simplified explanations to ensure comprehension.\r\n6.\tIdentification of FOIA Officer Handling This Request:\r\no\tProvide the full name, title, and direct contact information of the FOIA officer assigned to my request. This information is necessary for transparency and documentation.\r\n7.\tConfirmation of Accommodations:\r\no\tConfirm receipt of this request and explicitly acknowledge that each accommodation listed will be fully applied in all responses and communications.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\nDue to the pressing public interest in transparency and accountability in Medicaid-funded services for vulnerable populations, I request expedited processing under Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210(a), which mandates prompt availability of public records, and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), which allows expedited FOIA processing when there is an urgent need to inform the public.\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nI request a waiver of all associated fees under Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), as this request is in the public interest and not for commercial use. The disclosure of the requested information will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of Medicaid operations and beneficiary access to services under the ABI Waiver Program.\r\nTimeline Expectation\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request within four business days as required by Connecticut FOIA laws. Additionally, I request an estimated timeline for fulfillment.\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter and for upholding transparency and accountability in Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid system.\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The disclosure of information that I am seeking is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of operations and activities of the government and I have no commercial interest in the requested material. As the EPA develops new environmental regulations and emission standards, it is critical that there be transparency around EPA meetings and communications, especially as these meetings and communications may include non-governmental interested parties.\r\n\r\nThe request concerns the operations or activities of the government. The topic of the request concerns calendars that point to the activities of the government, including activities related to creating policy and passing regulations that impact the health and safety of the public. Furthermore, the requested materials will shed light on the activities of the EPA during a time when a relatively new administration is taking on ambitious environmental regulations.\r\n\r\nDisclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or activities. The information requested includes calendars of EPA officials during a period in which the EPA is working to develop and set new environmental regulations and emissions standards. Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the EPA\u2019s operations because the information requested will shed light on who EPA officials are meeting with, including government and non-government officials, and in turn, help the public understand what topics and stakeholders the EPA is considering during this time. With this information, the public will be better able to provide comment and otherwise participate in the regulatory process.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of requested information will likely result in public understanding. The information will help the public better understand the EPA's activities and operations as it develops new environmental rules and regulations. Documented is seeking this information because it is of interest to a large portion of the public, including the many concerned citizens that regularly acquire this type of information through our extensive range of publications. These publications include websites, blogs, newsletters, reports, press statements, social media networks such as Facebook, and Twitter. In addition, Documented\u2019s work reaches a broad audience by being featured in television, radio, print and online news articles and interviews, including Bloomberg, the Guardian, the Huffington Post among others.\r\n\r\nDocumented plans to compile the information from this request into a distinct, original work that will be released to the public through the manner described above. Moreover, Documented has the expertise and experience to disseminate the information received and ensure that disclosure of records will contribute to public understanding of operations at EPA.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of requested information will contribute significantly to public understanding. Information contained in material disclosed as a result of this request will contribute significantly to public understanding. Disclosure of information requested will provide new information to the public regarding agency operations during a time when a new administration has set ambitious climate goals and policy. This request is being sent during a time when there is immense urgency to address climate change and therefore, it is important that the public have a clear understanding of the EPA\u2019 activities and operations.\r\n\r\nAs public momentum around addressing the climate crisis continues to grow, it is critical that the public have access to information that will allow them to better understand the main government agency tasked with setting environmental regulatory policy. Greater transparency around who EPA officials are speaking and meeting with during this time will enable the public to understand whose interests are being considered and whose voices the EPA is listening to. For this reason, disclosure of the requested information will have significant impact on public understanding.\r\n\r\nThe requester has no commercial interest in the disclosure and therefore public interest in disclosure is greater than the commercial interest in the request. Documented does not have a commercial interest in the request. Documented seeks to inform the public about government activities and to serve the public interest by sharing materials disclosed through this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nColette Rosenberg",

Records identified as responsive to your request will be reviewed, and made available for your access, in accordance with relevant law and University policy. The estimated date of production is eight weeks, though we are often able to provide records more quickly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that many of the requested records are likely exempt from disclosure pursuant to the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 954 and Code of Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2018.030(a), respectively, as incorporated into Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.705);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records containing information the University acquired in confidence and not open, or officially disclosed, to the public (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 1040, as incorporated into Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.705);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records that pertain to pending litigation to which the University is a party (Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.200);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Correspondence of and to the Governor or employees of the Governor\u2019s office (Govt. Code 7928.000\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Preliminary drafts or notes that are not retained by the University in the ordinary course of business are protected from disclosure because the public interest in withholding those records clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure (Govt. Code \u00a7\u00a7 7927.500 and 7922.000);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records that are exempt due to the deliberative process privilege under Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000. Courts have applied section 7922.000 to exclude from public review materials the disclosure of which \u201cwould expose an agency's decision-making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency's ability to perform its functions\u201d (Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1342.). The materials withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege meet the requirements that the materials are both pre-decisional and deliberative (American Civil Liberties Union of Northern Cal. v. Superior Court (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 76.);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Personnel, medical, or similar files are exempt pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.700, and personal contact information is exempt from disclosure pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000, where disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; The public interest served by withholding private personal contact information outweighs any public interest served by disclosure.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUCOP CPRA Office\n",

It was also stated that VMI does not \"negotiate\" there permits.\r\n\r\nI am requesting a copy of all non-athletic student activity \"permits\" now in effect for student organizations at VMI.  Per the VMI website these include: Arnold Air Society, Aviation Club, Ballroom Dancing, Building Bridges, Coast Guard, Ducks Unlimited, Emergency Response Team, Equestrian, Fire Fighting, Fishing, Glee, Golf, Ethics, Internationa, Jiu-Jitsu, Men In Grey, Motivation, Pistol, Promaji, Ranger, Recon Commpany, Rock Climbing, Scuba, Cadet Life-Holding Account, Cadet Program Board, Coast Guard Club/Naval ROTC, Combat Support Group/Military Skills Group, The Bomb, Theater, Three Gun, Timber Framers, Trap and Skeet, Status Check/Podcast Club, VMI's scholarly journal \"Cadence\", American Campaigning Warefare, and any others not listed on the website.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting a copy of records showing how much non-VMI money each of the student activities received for any outside source and the source of those funds for the current academic year that is in addition to the VMI unds I assume are accurate on this published document. https://www.vmi.edu/media/content-assets/documents/comptroller/Cadet-Activity-Fees-2024-2025.pdf (if not please correct).\r\n\r\nGiven Maj. Gen. Wins' statement the permit for The Cadet was reviewed against all other permits during its drafting these shoudl be immediately available with little to no search required.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",
