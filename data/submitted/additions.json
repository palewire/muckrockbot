The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filed electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,",
