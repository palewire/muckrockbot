Subsequently, in January of 2024, Microsoft disclosed that Russian nation-state hackers broke into its systems and stole customer secrets that were contained in emails between Microsoft and the customers (https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/01/microsoft-actions-following-attack-by-nation-state-actor-midnight-blizzard/).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is the world's largest cybersecurity software provider by total sales, and one of the largest cybersecurity providers for the federal government, so it is in the public's interest to understand how the company responds to breaches that impact federal agency customers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am requesting the following records:\r\n- All digital and paper correspondence (such as electronic mail and paper mail) between CISA and representatives or employees from Microsoft Corporation from June 1, 2023 to present. Please include any attachments in responsive digital forms of correspondence.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAaron Holmes",
