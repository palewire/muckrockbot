I request all records containing the term \"Trump Organization\" that the FBI did not consider to be of investigative interest.  I believe that these records can most easily be located by conducting a full-text ECF search and a CRS main file and cross-reference search, eliminating the records resulting from the CRS main file and cross-reference searches, and producing the remaining records.  If it is easier, you may break my request into two parts: one for ECF and one for CRS, search for \"Trump Organization\" regardless of whether the records was of investigative interest, and produce the records separately and I will make the comparison myself.   If my request is unclear or I can assist in the process, please contact me by email at matt@loevy.com.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

In it, the office stated \"The Department of Defense's (DoD) Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO) will conduct a Solutions Meeting to support efforts to enhance the defense and protection of critical weapon systems. The Solutions Meeting will take place in Summer 2019 in McLean, VA. The Meeting provides selected innovative companies with an opportunity to make short technical presentations to government representatives about their technologies and products. There is a potential for companies to be selected for pilot projects or experimentation if their technology appears to match the DoD's needs.\" \r\n\r\nI am requesting a copy of all companies that submitted an application for the Solutions Meeting. In particular, the DOD stated \"Companies interested in participating in the Solutions Meeting should submit an application to RRTO Innovation via e-mail to osd.pentagon.ousd-atl.mbx.rrto-innovation@mail.mil. \" In particular, there should be emails with the Email subject line \u201cJAIC Solutions Meeting Application\u201d per DoD's instructions. \r\n\r\nI am seeking the full emails of all vendors who sent a proposal between April 1st 2019 and August 1st, 2019.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFreddy Martinez\n\n",

This way you will be able to get information directly from them with the parameters that you are looking for.  This going back and forth trying to figure out a way to narrow your scope and get you the info you want seems to me could be done a lot faster if you were dealing directly with them.  They have provided that avenue and we have forwarded that to you in a previous email.  If you would try that and see if this gets you the info you want I think you will find it is much easier and faster.   Then you can let us know if it satisfies your request and if it does we can close it out on this end.  I hope this makes since and Laura can re-send you the website info again if need be.\nThanks,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStephen L.

Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

        "communication": "PRR 11032021-Anon\r\nDear Requestor:\r\nPlease include in the above request number in all of your correspondence with this office.\r\nYour request is:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the Bellevue School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\nThank you for making your July 7 status inquiry, which will inform the District\u2019s next installment to your request, presently estimated for July 20, 2022.\r\nWe may have a misunderstanding as to what records you intend to request. I have been producing, on behalf of the District, public records request logs, which are \u201celectronic cop[ies]\u201d of \u201cPublic Records Requests received by the Bellevue School District.\u201d I understood the logs to be directly responsive to the first part of your request.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\n  1.  If you do not believe public records request logs are responsive to your request, please clarify your request to explain what records you intended to request by seeking \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the Bellevue School District.\u201d\r\n  2.  As you likely know, Washington law does not require agencies to retain records relating to public requests records beyond two years after the request is closed. The Local Government Common Records Retention Schedule, section 5.4, sets forth records that may be destroyed after two years, which \u201c[i]ncludes but is not limited to:\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cInternal and external correspondence relating to the request;\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRecords documenting the public records provided to the requestor (copies or lists of the records provided, etc.);\u201d and\r\n\r\n\u201cRecords documenting the public records (or portions) withheld (exemption logs, copies of portions redacted, etc.).\u201d\r\n\r\nThus, many such records relating to requests closed more than 2 years prior to the date of your request no longer exist. That is also why I was producing request logs to you. For many of the older requests, the request logs may be the only existing records. Do you no longer want to receive request logs, even if they may be the only existing records potentially responsive to your request with respect to requests closed more than two years prior to the date of your request?\r\n\r\n  1.  I was also producing request logs to give you an opportunity to identify particular requests that were of interest to you, so searches for records relating to those requests could be prioritized. Is that an opportunity that is of interest to you?\r\n\r\nYour answers to these clarification questions are due within 30 days, that is, on or before August 12. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District\u2019s next response. The District will not proceed with the next installment scheduled for July 20, pending receipt of your answers, so that the District\u2019s responses can reflect an accurate understanding of what you are requesting. If you do not answer within 30 days, your request may be closed.\r\n\r\nThe District is under no obligation to produce records to you in a reverse chronological order. Records will be produced in a manner that reflects the most efficient method of assembling and reviewing potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

If you do not believe public records request logs are responsive to your request, please clarify your request to explain what records you intended to request by seeking \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the Bellevue School District.\u201d\r\n\r\nANSWER: \r\n\r\nPRODUCE A COPY (NATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT PREFERRED) OF ALL PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS RECEIVED BY THE BELLEVUE SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR THE TIME PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2010 THROUGH NOVEMBER 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nPRODUCE A COPY (NATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT PREFERRED) OF EACH RESPONSE TO ALL PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS RECEIVED BY THE BELLEVUE SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR THE TIME PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2010 THROUGH NOVEMBER 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n2.

Therefore, appended hereto please find:\r\n\r\n2019 Log\r\n\r\nThis record contains information that is exempt under the Public Records Act, Chapter 42.56.RCW. Redactions made pursuant to the Act are marked with an overlying code. I have also attached a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that provides an explanation of the basis for the exemptions applied. If no code is applied or if a code is partially visible, the applicable codes are 1A, 10A.\r\n\r\nI regret that it was not possible to make an installment of records to you on the previously estimated date of August 3, 2022. The factors affecting the extension of that date included staff absences due to illness and vacation break, and ongoing workload in this department.\r\nAs I indicated to you in response to your request PRR 11022021-Anon, the District is not withholding any records from you and has nothing to hide.\r\nPlease direct all messages pertaining to your request to the public records mailbox, publicrecords@bsd405.org<mailto:publicrecords@bsd405.org>.\r\nThe automated correspondence features of the Muckrock site are not an efficient way to correspond or to review correspondence. Please do not interrupt our correspondence history by cutting messages out of the email string, or by excerpting them in any way. I know that the correspondence history can get long. However, it is important in order for us to communicate effectively that a complete and accurate history of our communications is readily available to both of us.\r\nI estimate a next installment to your request will be made on or before September 26, 2022. Estimated dates are subject to change. The timing of this estimate is based on anticipated staff absences, operational responsibilities related to school reopening, and the workload in this department.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wa.2d 863 (2015).\r\n\r\nWith respect to requests for records that include \"Writings\" per 42.56.010(4) this means handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nThis request specifically includes - and the District is specifically directed to obtain, preserve in native format, and produce - any records pertaining to public business that exist on any computers, hard drives, portable phones, jump drives, BlackBerries, iPhone, Kindle, IPad, or other devices, or in email, data, voice mail, or text mail accounts owned, controlled or paid for, directly or indirectly, by any agency or 3rd party. \r\n\r\nIn the event the District chooses to provide the records in installments over time I request the records to be produced in reverse chronological order - from the most recent to the earliest.\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the PRA. I also request  a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nFor emails I request production of emails in native MICROSOFT .pst (personal storage table) format which allows for a virtually infinite number of emails to be produced in a single digital file, providing for economy and convenience. If the .pst format is not available, I would request production of email in .pdf (portable document format) another widely accepted format for email production providing similar economy and convenience of a virtually infinite number emails bundled  into a single digital .pdf file. \r\n\r\nI request records production by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link if available or USB DRIVE or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "PRR 11022021-Anon (NOTE: please refer to this number in all correspondence regarding your request)\r\nDear Anonymous requestor:\r\nOn behalf of the Bellevue School District, I acknowledge receipt of your request as follows:\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND WRITINGS \u2013 PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST FOR ALL ELECTRONIC MAIL (E-MAIL), ELECTRONIC TEXTS, TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS, TELEPHONE MESSAGES, AND TELEPHONE LOGS of the following individuals for the period of time between January 1, 2019 \u2013 November 2, 2021:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafa\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nClarification Questions:\r\n\r\n  1.  Your request seeks communications \u201cof\u201d the above -named individuals. Please define what you intend by \u201cof.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of that would be that you are seeking records \u201cfrom\u201d the above individuals. Are you also seeking records \u201cto\u201d the above-named persons? Are you seeking communications on which the above persons were cc\u2019d?\r\n  2.  I assume you intended to refer to School Board Member Sima Sarrafan. Please correct me if I am mistaken.\r\n  3.  It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n  1.  I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n  2.  I recognize in this regard that you are requesting more recent records be produced first. Please be advised that it may be possible to honor that request within a body of records of a certain type (such as emails). It may not always be possible to do so consistently across all record types, due to differences in how different types of records are assembled.\r\n\r\nIn that regard, please specify a date range that you regard as \u201crecent.\u201d For example, are you requesting that the last 6 months of records be produced for all of the persons named above before any earlier records are produced for any other person, at least within a certain type of record? Please be advised that while the District will try to honor your preferences, the District will retain flexibility in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour answers to the above clarification questions are due on or before December 9, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTiming of Response\r\n\r\nYour request will be completed in a series of installments. At this time, subject to potential adjustment based on your clarifications, I estimate a first installment of records for January 19, 2022. That present estimate is  based on the current workload in this office, staff available to respond to your request, the workload of staff who may be affected by your request and whose assistance may be required, and absences due to illness and/or the anticipated holidays. Response date estimates are subject to change.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Regarding clarification question 1:\r\n\u201cPlease define what you intend by \u201cof.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of that would be that you are seeking records \u201cfrom\u201d the above individuals.\u201d\r\nYour answer included this comment:\r\nRegarding the requested public record communications \"of\" and \"from\" the previously referenced individuals . . ..\r\nIt appears that your answer is that you intend \u201cof\u201d to mean \u201cfrom.\u201d The District will proceed in that manner unless you advise otherwise.\r\n\r\n2.                   Please allow me to explain that In general, email records of each of the named individuals will be searched and produced separately by individual. Some of the search results may be combined in order to avoid a high number of duplications.  The District will retain discretion in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\nAssuming separate production sets for each individual and some combined groups as appropriate, please advise if you would like to prioritize the individuals listed. The District will try to honor any such priorities, within parameters that are consistent with the most efficient processing of your request.\r\n\r\n3.                   You have asked for records to be produced in reverse chronological order, stating that you prefer the District to produce emails first. To clarify, are you asking that all email records back to 1.1.19 for an individual be produced before any records are produced for another individual?\r\n\r\n4.                   You did not respond to the questions numbered 3 and 4 (renumbered below due to formatting loss in your reply message) regarding targeting your request. As noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743.  Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that production of emails in .pst format is not possible. Every record is reviewed for applicable exemptions, and appropriate redactions will be applied prior to the production of records to you. The redaction process occurs only in a .pdf format. Each individual message is converted to a .pdf format.\r\n\r\nYour answers to these questions are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers may affect the timing of the District\u2019s responses to your request. Additional clarification questions may arise in the course of responding to your request.\r\n\r\nI am glad to assist you in accessing records that will be meaningful to you.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  You have not responded to the following questions sent to you on 11.9.21, numbered 3 and 4 in that message. This is the District\u2019s third request for a response to these questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n3.       It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n4.       I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reminding you om 11.17.21 to respond to questions 3 and 4, I explained the importance to you of your answering these questions:\r\n\r\nAs noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743. Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\nThank you for clarifying your request at the outset. It is essential that we have a mutual understanding. Additional clarifications may arise in the course of processing your request. Your answers to the questions above are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District\u2019s response.\r\n\r\nMissing correspondence history\r\nPlease review the message you sent on 11.19.21 at 1:39 PM, and the message you sent on 11.18.21. In each of those messages, portions of the correspondence history between you and this office were missing, including but not limited to the 11.9.21 message to you containing the clarification questions above, to which you have not yet responded.\r\nPerhaps this is a technical aberration of the service you are using. If necessary, please work with Muckrock to determine why portions of correspondence history related to your request may not be retained when you reply to a message. For example, your 11.19.21 message immediately below contains a history that skips from your message dated 11.02.21 to your message dated 11.11.21. Please take steps to prevent that from occurring in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request Process\r\n\r\nYou state:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo search need be conducted \u2013 archive or copy the entire email account for the dates requested and produce the result preferably in .PST format.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease allow me to help you understand public record response procedures, so that your expectations can be realistic. When a request for records is made, the District conducts a search for potentially responsive records. When potentially responsive records are assembled, each record is reviewed to determine whether it is responsive, and if so, whether the law requires that exemptions be applied to it. If some or all of a record is exempt, the District applies redactions to that record or withholds it, and then describes to the requestor the basis for any exemptions that were applied. As noted below, it is not possible to produce records in .PST format, because records must first be converted to .PDF format in order to apply redactions to them.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it is not possible to \u201ccopy\u201d the contents of \u201can entire email account\u201d and produce all emails within such a an account to you. Each email must first be reviewed, analyzed, and processed for production.\r\n\r\nAs noted in my 11.09.021 message to you, your request will be completed in a series of installments. Due to the procedures described above, only a limited number of email records can be produced per installment. Each request is unique, but given the workload of this office, email records can be generally processed at a rate of perhaps 30-100 individual emails per installment. Installments may occur at varying intervals, which can be 30 days or more. These processing volume rates vary widely based on the nature of the request and other factors.\r\nAs stated above, during the nearly 3-year period you have identified, one of the persons on your list sent 38,743 emails\u2014that is 38,743 emails were \u201cfrom\u201d that person. There may be some duplications within that number. However, even if that number was significantly reduced to something in the range of 20,000 emails, and assuming a rate of processing those records at 100 per month, it could take 200 months, or more than 16 years, to process only the emails \u201cfrom\u201d that one person on your list.\r\n\r\nI am taking the time to explain this to you in detail, at the beginning of processing your request, so that you can understand how important it is to you, assuming your intention is to receive records that are meaningful to you and relate to a legitimate purpose, to limit your request by targeting it in some way as described in questions 3 and 4 above. I can help you find the needle in the haystack that you really want.

When you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n1. communications \u201cfrom\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\nYES - ALL\r\n\r\nWhen you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n1. communications \u201cto\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\nYES - ALL\r\n\r\nWhen you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n1. communications \u201ccopied to\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\nYES - ALL\r\n\r\n1. You have not responded to the following questions sent to you on 11.9.21, numbered 3 and 4 in that message. This is the District\u2019s third request for a response to these questions:\r\n\r\n3. It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n#3 WHAT IS THE QUESTION? \"PLEASE CONSIDER SPECIFYING PARTICULAR RECORDS OF INTEREST?\"  I SEE NO QUESTION.\r\n\r\n4. I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n\r\n#4 WHAT IS THE QUESTION? AN \"INVATATION\" THAT I DISCLOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS RECORDS REQUEST THAT I HAVE NO LEGAL OBLIGATION TO DISCLOSE? I SEE NO QUESTION.\r\n\r\nIn reminding you om 11.17.21 to respond to questions 3 and 4, I explained the importance to you of your answering these questions:\r\n\r\nAs noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743. Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\nThank you for clarifying your request at the outset. It is essential that we have a mutual understanding. Additional clarifications may arise in the course of processing your request. Your answers to the questions above are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District\u2019s response.\r\n\r\nMissing correspondence history\r\nPlease review the message you sent on 11.19.21 at 1:39 PM, and the message you sent on 11.18.21. In each of those messages, portions of the correspondence history between you and this office were missing, including but not limited to the 11.9.21 message to you containing the clarification questions above, to which you have not yet responded.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is a technical aberration of the service you are using. If necessary, please work with Muckrock to determine why portions of correspondence history related to your request may not be retained when you reply to a message. For example, your 11.19.21 message immediately below contains a history that skips from your message dated 11.02.21 to your message dated 11.11.21. Please take steps to prevent that from occurring in the future.\r\n\r\nI STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE ASKING. YOU HAVE THE EMAILS I SEND YOU AND I HAVE THE EMAILS YOU SEND ME. WHAT IS \"MISSING?\" AT THIS POINT PLEASE PROVIDE A LEGAL BASIS FOR MY OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH WHATEVER MORE YOU ARE REQUESTING OF ME.\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request Process\r\nYou state:\r\n\u201cNo search need be conducted \u2013 archive or copy the entire email account for the dates requested and produce the result preferably in .PST format.\u201d\r\nPlease allow me to help you understand public record response procedures, so that your expectations can be realistic. When a request for records is made, the District conducts a search for potentially responsive records. When potentially responsive records are assembled, each record is reviewed to determine whether it is responsive, and if so, whether the law requires that exemptions be applied to it. If some or all of a record is exempt, the District applies redactions to that record or withholds it, and then describes to the requestor the basis for any exemptions that were applied. As noted below, it is not possible to produce records in .PST format, because records must first be converted to .PDF format in order to apply redactions to them.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it is not possible to \u201ccopy\u201d the contents of \u201can entire email account\u201d and produce all emails within such a an account to you. Each email must first be reviewed, analyzed, and processed for production.\r\n\r\nAs noted in my 11.09.021 message to you, your request will be completed in a series of installments. Due to the procedures described above, only a limited number of email records can be produced per installment. Each request is unique, but given the workload of this office, email records can be generally processed at a rate of perhaps 30-100 individual emails per installment. Installments may occur at varying intervals, which can be 30 days or more. These processing volume rates vary widely based on the nature of the request and other factors.\r\nAs stated above, during the nearly 3-year period you have identified, one of the persons on your list sent 38,743 emails\u2014that is 38,743 emails were \u201cfrom\u201d that person. There may be some duplications within that number. However, even if that number was significantly reduced to something in the range of 20,000 emails, and assuming a rate of processing those records at 100 per month, it could take 200 months, or more than 16 years, to process only the emails \u201cfrom\u201d that one person on your list.\r\n\r\nI am taking the time to explain this to you in detail, at the beginning of processing your request, so that you can understand how important it is to you, assuming your intention is to receive records that are meaningful to you and relate to a legitimate purpose, to limit your request by targeting it in some way as described in questions 3 and 4 above. I can help you find the needle in the haystack that you really want. You do not need to ask for the haystack to achieve your legitimate purpose.\r\n\r\nI am available to assist you in exploring options by which you can limit your request so that it will yield records that will be meaningful to you, while retaining your broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

You requested emails to be produced in reverse chron order, in 6 month blocks, to/from/cc the following persons in this following order:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafan\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nTo give you a sense of the volume of records you have requested, searches of potentially responsive records for the following persons for the first six-month period, 05 01 21 through 11 02 21, returned the following numbers of potentially responsive messages to be reviewed and processed for production to you:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran                                                                   8420\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis                                                                      7245\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas              25,244\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn     13.443\r\nTotal for these 4 individuals, 05 01 21-11 02 21:                                  53,952\r\n\r\nThis installment includes emails to/from/cc Superintendent Ivan Duran for the period 10 01 21-10 14 21. This is roughly the first half of the month of October 2021, consisting of 446 messages. The period 10 15 21-11 02 21 will be the subject of the next installment.\r\n\r\nThe records are being produced to you via Box, from which you may retrieve, view, and download records. Please click the link below to retrieve the following records:\r\nNOTE: I am having technical difficulties creating this link. I will complete this process as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dr. Duran has not been employed by the District since the spring of 2021. As a result, there are no messages from him in this group. The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nMy observation in processing your request to date is that it could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\nNo redactions were made to these records.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for February 25, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

You requested emails to be produced in reverse chron order, in 6 month blocks, to/from/cc the following persons in this following order:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafan\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nThis installment includes emails to/from/cc Superintendent Ivan Duran for the period 10 15 21 through 10 21 2021. It includes 227 messages. The period 10 22 2021 through 11 02 2021 will be the subject of the next installment.\r\n\r\nThe records are being produced to you via Box, from which you may retrieve, view, and download records, within 30 days of receipt. A link will be provided to you to access the records in a message that will follow shortly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dr. Duran has not been employed by the District since the spring of 2021. As a result, there are no messages from him in this group. The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nYour request could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the number of persons whose communications are sought; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\n\r\nRedactions were made to one record in this set, consistent with exemptions set forth in the Public Records Act. Redactions are indicated by blocked out text with an overlying code. I have also attached to this message a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis for the exemptions that applied.  If there are any records that contain marked out texts that do not have an overlying code, that is the form in which the record was received by the District.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for March 30, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Please do not interrupt our correspondence history by cutting messages out of the email string. I know that history can get long. However, it is important in order for us to communicate effectively that an accurate history of our communications is readily available to both of us.\r\nPlease allow me to summarize our recent correspondence:\r\n\r\nFeb 25\u2013email from BSD, making second installment consisting of 227 emails, and providing link to Box for records.\r\nFeb 26\u2014confirmation from Box site to BSD that you accepted and opened link to records.\r\nJune 29\u2014email from you, stating you had received only one installment, on 1.9.22.\r\nJune 29\u2013email from BSD, setting a next installment for July 21.\r\nJuly 15\u2014email from you, inquiring as to status. Appears to be automated Muckrock email. June 29 message from BSD does not appear to have been read.\r\nJuly 21\u2014email from BSD, inquiring further about your statement on June 29 that you had received only one installment, and listing two installments that were produced. Attached your 2.26.22 acceptance of link to second installment provided via Box site. Advised that estimated installment intended for July 21 would be extended to July 22.\r\nJuly 25, 26, 28 \u2013 emails from BSD, extending estimated dates from July 22 to August 1, with explanations.\r\nAug 3\u2013email from you, explaining (for the first time) that you were not able to open the link to records that were sent to you on 2.25.22.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 Produced to You Again\r\nFirst, let\u2019s take care of your receipt of the records in the February 25 installment. You were advised in a February 25 email that a link to the records was on its way to you. I received confirmation on February 26 that you accepted and opened the link that was sent to you. Now, on August 3, you explain for the first time that you were not able to retrieve records in the link that was provided to you. If you had let me know in February that you had difficulty retrieving the records, we could have resolved it at that time. I recognize there may be glitches with technology. I am glad to work with you to resolve them promptly, if you let me know.\r\n\r\nEach installment is made available to you for 30 days. In the future, if you do not acknowledge and accept receipt of records within 30 days after they are made available to you, your request will be closed as abandoned.\r\n\r\nI am re-sending you the records that were provided to you in installment 2 on February 25, 2021. I will attach these to two emails to you, due to their volume.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 consisted of 227 email records covering a period of October 15-21, 2021, in zip folders are follows:\r\n2021 10 15_10 19, Duran, 122 (attached here)\r\n2021 10 20_10 21, Duran, 105 (will be attached to an email that follows)\r\n\r\nThe second zip folder includes a record that contains information that is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act. Exempt information is redacted and marked with an overlay code. I will attach to the following email a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis of exemptions applied.\r\n\r\nProgress on your high-volume request\r\nPlease appreciate the overall high volume of your request, when there are 227 email records in one week for one of your named recipients. Each individual email record you request must be retrieved from archives, reviewed for applicability to your request and for exemptions, and then prepared for production to you.\r\nDue to typical operational capacity of this department, it is generally possible to process roughly 100 email records per installment, and to make installments to a requestor every 60 to 90 days. These are general capacity numbers, which may be adjusted in different contexts for different types of requests. Most requestors seek specific information that is likely to be meaningful to them, which allows for effective and efficient request processing.\r\nYour request, on the other hand, seeks a high volume of communications, from a large group of persons, with no specific focus or topic. As a result, the volume of records will be is very high, the retrieval time is extensive, and the review process is very time-consuming.\r\nYou have been provided 446 records in installment 1, Jan 19 2022; and 227 records in installment 2, February 25 2022, for a total of 673 records. This is well within standard processing rate.\r\n\r\nNext Estimated Installment\r\nThe District attempts to meet its estimated installment dates. Sometimes that is not possible. If it is not possible to meet an estimated date, you will be provided an explanation and a revised estimated date.\r\nThe time it took to complete today\u2019s correspondence was time the District was not able to devote to a next installment to you.\r\nI estimate a next installment for September 1, 2022. That estimate takes into account factors of summer staff absences; staff absences for other reasons, including medical leaves; the current workload of this department; and the complexity of assembly and review required for your request as set forth above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

The basis for any redactions in the documents provided (or the basis for denying the production of documents in their entirety) is further explained below. The Bay County Sheriff's Office has compiled fifteen (15) pages of documents and thirty-three (33) photographs in response to this request.\r\n\r\nSince the time spent searching for this information was less than the time allowable in which to assess fees, charges are waived for processing this request. Accordingly, the responsive records have been released, and you may view and download them by clicking here: Request Number: 2023-377\r\n\r\nAs indicated above, portions of your request have been denied in part because the information you requested is exempt under FOIA. Accordingly, I have set forth the applicable exemptions for you below. \r\n\r\nYour request has been denied in part because I have found that releasing this information would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy. Accordingly, cellular telephone numbers have been redacted and withheld from these records under MCL 15.243(1)(a) & (b)(iii).\r\n\r\nThe pertinent provision of the Act upon which this response/exemption is based read as follows:\r\n\r\nSec. 13. (1) A public body may exempt from disclosure as a public record under this act any of the following:\r\n\r\n(a) Information of a personal nature if public disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of an individual's privacy.\r\n\r\n(b) Investigating records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that disclosure as a public record would do any of the following:\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\niii. Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\r\n\r\nDisclosing the above-referenced information would constitute an unwarranted invasion of a third-party individual's privacy under the Act. In addition, this information is generally not available to the general public and is not listed in a general public directory. Release of that information to members of the public could also allow their misuse and cause both emotional and economic hardship to those third parties. Finally, releasing the above-described information of those third parties would not assist any member of the public in understanding the function or working of government, as is the promoted intent of the Act.  \r\n\r\nIf you are dissatisfied with this response, I want to advise you of your appeal rights. You may file a written appeal to the Bay County Executive that specifically states the word \u201cAPPEAL\u201d and must give the reason or reasons for reversal of the denial, or if you are appealing a fee, specifically identify how the required fee exceeds the amount permitted. Alternatively, you may seek judicial review of this denial pursuant to MCL 15.240. If you seek judicial review and the Court determines the public body made an improper decision regarding the records sought, you may be entitled to attorney fees and the potential damages outlined in the statute.\r\n\r\nPlease be assured that Bay County is committed to full compliance with public policies promoting the disclosure of information regarding governmental affairs and the actions of public employees. Bay County\u2019s FOIA Procedures & Guidelines and Public Summary are available upon request or on our website at: https://www.baycounty-mi.gov/CorporationCounsel/FOIA.aspx.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicole LaDouce\r\nFOIA Coordinator\r\n\r\nBay County FOIA Division\r\n515 Center Avenue, Ste. 402\r\nBay City, Michigan 48708\r\n(989) 895-4131\r\nfoia@baycounty.net\"",

You requested the following: \r\n\"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\n- The 54 deleted tweets mentioned in this tweet: https://web.archive.org/web/20201121030914/https://twitter.com/EverettPoliceWA/status/1329983974374948866 \r\n- Any other tweets deleted in 2020 \r\n- Any emails since 11/19 mentioning \"twitter\" or \"tweets\" (case insensitive) \r\n\r\nIf other tweets are found to be deleted in 2020, please indicate the tweets that were part of the 54 mentioned in the above tweet. Additionally, if you require additional time to search for deleted tweets other than the initial 54, please provide those in a later installment. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nBridget Brululo \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://https://www.muckrock.comhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Feverett-police-department-777%252Fdeleted-tweets-everett-police-department-105132%252F%253Femail%253Djjacobs%252540everettwa.gov&url_auth_token=AAAYsCRk98F8zbnvpaYMvpEE-v4%3A1khm63%3ATB1Exkcj1ot819ysihcOyY4GiCM\" \r\nThe next installment of records responsive to your request is available to you now in the City of Everett Public Records Center. Click the link below this message to login to the Public Records Center and retrieve the records. \r\nThe EPOA twitter account is a private account that is not run by the Everett Police Department.\u00a0 However, we do have some tweets that we are providing.\u00a0 I am unable to confirm if these tweets were part of the \"54 deleted tweets\".\u00a0 We are also releasing the outlook .pst file of emails containing \"tweet\" and redaction withholding log. \r\nWe are asking for clarification on emails containing \"twitter\".\u00a0 Our standard email signature contains the word twitter as a link to the Everett Police Department twitter account.\u00a0 Due to this, almost all emails contain \"twitter\".\u00a0 My initial search indicated over 9500 emails to review.\u00a0 It is likely that most of these will not contain the records you are seeking.\u00a0 Would you be able to provide any alternate search term that would help narrow the search?\u00a0 Please respond by 9/6/2023.\u00a0 If we do not receive a response by 9/6/2023, Everett PD will interpret your request to be abandoned and closed. \r\nIf we receive clarification, we estimate the next installment date to this request will be available on or before 9/6/2023. \u00a0If public records become available in advance of this estimate we will contact you promptly. \u00a0Conversely, if the Everett Police Department encounters a need to extend our estimate, we will contact you promptly with a revised estimated date. \r\nThank you for your patience in awaiting this information. \r\nSincerely, \r\nBrent Flagg \r\nEverett Police Department \r\nPublic Disclosure Unit \r\n425-257-8471",

Pursuant to Code of Virginia \u00a7 2.2-3704(H), when Arlington County determines in advance that charges for producing the requested records are likely to exceed $200, the County can require an estimate deposit. The County requires an estimate deposit that is 50 percent of the estimated costs to be paid before continuing to process your request. The County will not continue to process your request until the estimate deposit is paid. Please let us know if you would like to discuss your FOIA request. Based upon your request, a total of 3,591 emails were identified as containing one of the keywords provided. We have estimated approximately 30 seconds of review for each subject line of the 3, 591 emails. Providing more specific key words or a date range could limit the scope of your request and could result in a lower estimate. You can either reply to this email or call us at either number in the signature block below to discuss further. \r\nThe deposit will be credited toward the final cost of supplying the requested records that will be provided on the final invoice at the same time as the County\u2019s response to your request. If the County\u2019s final costs are more than initially estimated, this will be reflected on the final invoice containing the remainder of the balance to be paid. If the County\u2019s final costs for responding to your request are less than the estimate deposit paid, then this will be reflected on the final invoice and you will be refunded the difference. An invoice will be sent to you for the amount of the estimate deposit in a separate email. Please follow the instructions in that email to make payment.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Please include Model Name, Vendor, and Date Purchased at minimum. \r\n- Audits on any voting equipment (include dates, company, costs) per M. G. L. c. 54 \u00a7 33I\r\n- Devices removed (when removed, when originally purchased, reason for removal) \r\n-Devices with serial numbers and model used in 2020 presidential election.\r\n-Devices with serial numbers and model numbers in current circulation to be used in next election/November 2022. \r\n- When the name \"Sara Cooke\" or \"Sara Breton\" occurred on voting records. Looking for dates I voted. (Please interchange, as name may include middle initial of E. or Elizabeth. For confirmation: Snipatuit Road, Pine Street, Hazel Road, Wall Street are the addresses to cross confirm).  \r\n- In Rochester, under maiden name of Sara Breton, I was a poll worker. Kindly include those dates as to when I was working for the town.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSara Cooke",

Mizell was a founding member of the hip-hop group Run-DMC and a pioneer in the music industry. He was tragically killed on October 30, 2002, at his recording studio in Queens, New York. I am referencing an article from Rolling Stone magazine, published on March 4, 2021, titled \"Jam Master Jay Alleged Killer Goes to Trial,\" which provides some background on the investigation into his death and the subsequent trial of his alleged killer.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), I request that all records be released to me, including any documents, memos, emails, or other materials that reference or relate to Jason William Mizell or his death. Additionally, I request that a key string search be conducted to ensure that all relevant records are provided to me. Specifically, I would like to request that the following key strings be used in the search:\r\n\r\nJam Master Jay\r\nJason Mizell\r\nRun-DMC\r\nMurder\r\nHomicide\r\nInvestigation\r\nSuspect\r\nArrest\r\nTrial\r\nEvidence\r\nWitness\r\nStatement\r\nInterview\r\nAutopsy\r\nForensic\r\nBallistics\r\nGang\r\nDrug\r\nCriminal\r\nViolence\r\nNew York City\r\nI also request any records that may be responsive to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) program.\r\n\r\nI would like to remind you that the FOIA reflects a strong presumption in favor of disclosure, and that any exemptions to the Act must be narrowly construed. The Supreme Court has held that the FOIA promotes transparency and accountability in government, and that any exemptions to the Act must be based on specific and narrowly defined grounds.

        "communication": "Dear FOIPA Appeals Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal the response I received to my FOIPA request number 1586780000 regarding Jason William Mizell. The response stated that my request was not sufficiently identified because I did not provide my complete name, and that an anonymous request does not meet the requirements of the Department of Justice's FOIA regulations.\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe that case law supports the position that a requester's anonymity does not necessarily preclude access to information under the FOIA. In the case of McGehee v. CIA, the court held that \"an agency may not refuse to disclose information merely because it is requested by an anonymous individual\" (697 F.2d 1095, 1104 [D.C. Cir. 1983]).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the FOIA provides that upon receipt of a reasonably described request, records can be made available to a \"person\" (5 USC \u00a7 552 [a][3][A]). It does not explicitly require the requester to provide their complete name or any personal information. The Department of Justice's FOIA regulations may require a requester's complete name, but I believe that those regulations cannot override the requirements of the FOIA itself.\r\n\r\nBased on the above, I respectfully request that the FBI reconsider its decision to deny my FOIPA request on the basis of my anonymity, and provide access to the requested records. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

Code \u00a7 2.2-3700 et seq., for the following records: \r\n To Whom It May Concern: \r\n \r\n Pursuant to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n \r\n I am requesting, from 01/01/2012 to present, records of: name, position, hire date, official salary or rate of pay (on an annual basis) for anyone with the word 'perfusion' in their job title. \r\n \r\n I discussed my request with the Virginia FOIA council and they advised: \"Generally speaking, accounting records showing payments made to an individual would be open to public disclosure, but notations regarding the type of pay or reasons for payment may be withheld as personnel information. Please see AO-01-21 which discussed salary/rate of pay, payroll, and accounting records in detail.\" \r\n \r\n Therefore, in addition, I am also requesting accounting records from 01/01/2012 to present showing name and aggregate total annual (calendar year preferred, but fiscal year acceptable) payments made to any individuals with the word 'perfusion' in their job title as well. \r\n \r\n If you need any further clarification or if there is any way to reduce the labor required to produce these records in this detail, please let me know. \r\n \r\n The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n \r\n In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available. \r\n \r\n Sincerely, \r\n \r\n Tom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Brent Thye. \r\nAttached you will find records responsive to your request.\u00a0 The University has included records from 2018-2022.\u00a0 Records prior to 2018 do not exist.

Code \u00a7 2.2-3700 et seq., for the following records: \r\n\r\n Thank you for the data you sent me, however it is only partially what I am seeking. It appears to be each employees' \"official salary or rate of pay\" but I did not receive accounting records showing their total aggregate payments received each year. As stated in my original request: I am also requesting accounting records from 01/01/2012 to present showing name and aggregate total annual (calendar year preferred, but fiscal year acceptable) payments made to any individuals with the word 'perfusion' in their job title as well. I discussed my request with the Virginia FOIA council and they advised: \"Generally speaking, accounting records showing payments made to an individual would be open to public disclosure, but notations regarding the type of pay or reasons for payment may be withheld as personnel information. Please see AO-01-21 which discussed salary/rate of pay, payroll, and accounting records in detail.\" I look forward to receiving these files, thank you.
