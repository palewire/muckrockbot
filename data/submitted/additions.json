Understand that the names of some applicants who were not selected may be confidential and reasonably redacted from such documents as scoring sheets, etc. This should not apply to the application Ms Wallace submitted or her qualifications, verifications VMI did, etc., as she was hired for the position and is now a public figure, a state employee, and VMI - as well as Ms Wallace - made several social media posts, public announcements and information on their websites in the Press about her background and qualifications. All of her information should be disclosed and readily available from VMI.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",
