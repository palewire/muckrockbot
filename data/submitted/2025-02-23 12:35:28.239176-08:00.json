All communications regarding this request are public and will be disclosed as appropriate.\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Oregon Public Records Law (ORS 192.311 \u2013 192.478), I request access to the following records related to Sidney Mecham\u2019s arrest, investigation, and prosecution for driving through the closed Rose Festival Grand Floral Parade on June 10, 2023. Mecham was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, making all related law enforcement records subject to public disclosure.\r\n\r\nI formally demand the preservation of all responsive records, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tBody-worn camera footage\r\n\t\u2022\tDashcam recordings\r\n\t\u2022\t911 call recordings and transcripts\r\n\t\u2022\tPolice dispatch logs\r\n\t\u2022\tArrest reports and investigative files\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal police communications related to the case\r\n\r\nDestroying, altering, or withholding these records without legal justification could constitute a violation of public records law and a due process violation under Chaudhry v. City of Los Angeles, 751 F.3d 1096 (9th Cir. 2014). Further, Public Citizen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989) reaffirms the public\u2019s right to government transparency.\r\n\r\n1. Body-Worn Camera (BWC) Footage\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll footage from officers who responded to Sidney Mecham\u2019s incident on June 10, 2023.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 133.741 requires law enforcement to retain and disclose BWC footage unless exempt.\r\n\t\u2022\tACLU of Nevada v. City of Las Vegas, 333 F.3d 1092 (9th Cir. 2003) confirmed that police bodycam recordings are subject to public records laws.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 133.741\r\n\r\n2.

City of Portland, 183 Or App 647 (2002) established mandatory disclosure of non-exempt police records.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.345(3)\r\n\r\n3. 911 Call Recordings and Transcripts\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll 911 call recordings and transcripts related to Mecham\u2019s actions and arrest.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 192.345(3) states that 911 calls are public records unless an exemption applies.\r\n\t\u2022\tState v. Worthington, 138 Or App 104 (1995) upheld that 911 call transcripts must be disclosed unless privacy outweighs public interest.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.345(3)\r\n\r\n4. Police Dispatch Audio and Transcripts\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll officer-dispatch communications related to Sidney Mecham\u2019s arrest.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 192.311 provides for the disclosure of police communication records.\r\n\t\u2022\tNew York Times Co. v. NASA, 852 F.2d 602 (D.C. Cir. 1988) affirmed that public agencies must disclose internal communications unless an exemption applies.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.311\r\n\r\n5. Arrest and Booking Reports\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tComplete arrest and booking reports related to Mecham\u2019s case, including officer narratives.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 192.345(3) mandates disclosure of completed law enforcement reports.\r\n\t\u2022\tAfshar v. Dept. of State, 702 F.2d 1125 (D.C. Cir. 1983) held that agencies must disclose non-exempt portions of law enforcement records.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.345(3)\r\n\r\n6.

Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989) held that government information disclosure fosters accountability.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.324(5)\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records\r\n\r\nI formally demand that all responsive records be preserved under:\r\n\t\u2022\t44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3106 (prohibiting unlawful destruction of public records).\r\n\t\u2022\t5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (ensuring preservation of records subject to FOIA requests).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide:\r\n\t\u2022\tA written explanation citing the specific FOIA exemptions invoked.\r\n\t\u2022\tAll segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request and provide an estimated timeline for processing.

For the Grant Period 07/2024 - 12/2025 the NEA reports a grant of $1,146,200. \r\n\r\nThis N.E.A. money funds I.A.C. programs in various capacities.

The I.A.C. website instructs individuals to file a F.O.I.A. for cases where this information is desired. \r\n\r\nThat said, I request all communication between the Illinois Arts Council and the City of Evanston (including the E.A.C.) regarding grant money from June 2024 to the time that this request is processed. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would be greatly appreciated if you provided a detailed breakdown of N.E.A. funding allocated to the city of Evanston during this same time frame. \r\n\r\nIf applicable, I request that fees be waived as documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
