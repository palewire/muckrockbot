In order to ensure a comprehensive search for responsive records, I am also requesting an interagency search for any records that may be held by other law enforcement agencies or government entities.\r\n\r\nI want to emphasize that I do not consent to the withholding, deletion, or redaction of any responsive records or documents, except in cases where the Texas Department of Public Safety can provide a specific justification for why the records are exempt from disclosure under the Texas Public Information Act. Please provide me with any non-exempt records or documents in their entirety, including any segregable portions that may be released.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I hereby provide notice that any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records or documents without providing a specific justification for why they are exempt from disclosure will be met with a complaint and legal action to compel the Texas Department of Public Safety to provide access to the requested records in accordance with the Texas Public Information Act.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to reference local case law and state case law that affirm the public's right to access government records under the Texas Public Information Act. Specifically, local case law includes the Dallas Morning News v. City of Dallas, 281 S.W.3d 708 (Tex. App. \u2013 Dallas 2009, no pet.), which held that a government entity cannot withhold requested information unless it can demonstrate that the information falls within a specific exception under the Texas Public Information Act. State case law includes the Texas Department of Public Safety v. Cox Texas Newspapers, LP, 304 S.W.3d 191 (Tex. App. \u2013 Austin 2009, pet. denied), which affirmed the public's right to access government records and held that the Texas Department of Public Safety must release requested information unless it falls within a specific exception under the Texas Public Information Act.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the Texas Department of Public Safety's surveillance or investigation of Black Lives Matter, including any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to this surveillance or investigation. I am also requesting any communications between the Texas Department of Public Safety and other law enforcement agencies or government entities related to the surveillance or investigation of Black Lives Matter.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am interested in any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the Texas Department of Public Safety's surveillance or investigation of any groups or individuals associated with Black Lives Matter or involved in activism related to racial justice, police reform, or other related issues. This may include but is not limited to groups such as the Movement for Black Lives, Campaign Zero, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to request a key string search for any records or documents related to Black Lives Matter or any other related groups, as well as any communications or activities related to these groups. Additionally, please provide any records or documents related to any specialty units within the Texas Department of Public Safety that may be involved in surveillance or investigation activities related to Black Lives Matter or other related groups.\r\n\r\nIf any responsive records or documents are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide me with a justification for each exemption relied upon.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am writing to request access to any records or files held by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) related to Jason William Mizell, who is also known as Jam Master Jay. Mizell was a founding member of the hip-hop group Run-DMC and a pioneer in the music industry. He was tragically killed on October 30, 2002, at his recording studio in Queens, New York. I am referencing an article from Rolling Stone magazine, published on March 4, 2021, titled \"Jam Master Jay Alleged Killer Goes to Trial,\" which provides some background on the investigation into his death and the subsequent trial of his alleged killer.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), I request that all records be released to me, including any documents, memos, emails, or other materials that reference or relate to Jason William Mizell or his death. Additionally, I request that a key string search be conducted to ensure that all relevant records are provided to me. Specifically, I would like to request that the following key strings be used in the search:\r\n\r\nJam Master Jay\r\nJason Mizell\r\nRun-DMC\r\nMurder\r\nHomicide\r\nInvestigation\r\nSuspect\r\nArrest\r\nTrial\r\nEvidence\r\nWitness\r\nStatement\r\nInterview\r\nAutopsy\r\nForensic\r\nBallistics\r\nGang\r\nDrug\r\nCriminal\r\nViolence\r\nNew York City\r\nI also request any records that may be responsive to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) program.\r\n\r\nI would like to remind you that the FOIA reflects a strong presumption in favor of disclosure, and that any exemptions to the Act must be narrowly construed. The Supreme Court has held that the FOIA promotes transparency and accountability in government, and that any exemptions to the Act must be based on specific and narrowly defined grounds. See United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989); John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146 (1989); and Nat'l Archives & Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), among other cases.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would like to give notice that I do not consent to any withholding, redaction, or deletion of records that may be responsive to my request, except in cases where the documents are clearly exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This may include complaints related to securities fraud, insider trading, or any other area over which the SEC has jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nI would like to request information on any companies owned or controlled by Donald J Trump, including but not limited to the Trump Organization, Trump Foundation, and Trump International Hotels. Please include any and all relevant communications, documents, or other materials related to complaints filed against these entities or their representatives.\r\n\r\nTo support my request, I would like to cite several relevant court cases, including SEC v. Trump, 279 F. Supp. 2d 340 (S.D.N.Y. 2003), SEC v. Trump, 2020 WL 4044162 (S.D.N.Y. July 17, 2020), and SEC v. Trump, 2021 WL 1520177 (S.D.N.Y. April 19, 2021). These cases demonstrate the importance of transparency and accountability in the securities industry, and underscore the need for disclosure of relevant complaints and information.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to provide notice that any withholding or deletion of responsive records without a lawful basis will result in my pursuit of legal action and complaint to the appropriate authorities. As you are aware, FOIA requires agencies to disclose all non-exempt records in response to a request within a reasonable time frame, and any failure to do so would constitute a violation of the law.\r\n\r\nPlease provide any responsive records to this request on a rolling basis, as they become available.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",

Additionally, I would like to request any emails sent to or from the domain polksheriff.org, including any recipients in the \"To,\" \"From,\" \"CC,\" or \"BCC\" fields.\r\n\r\nPlease provide any responsive records for the last 5 years, dating from April 5, 2018 to April 5, 2023.\r\n\r\nAs per Florida Public Records Law, agencies are required to provide access to public records unless the records are exempted by law. If any responsive documents contain exempt information, please provide me with the remaining non-exempt portions of the records, and redact or withhold the exempt information.\r\n\r\nI would like to remind you that under Florida law, agencies have an obligation to disclose records and not to withhold or redact information that can be reasonably segregated and not subject to exemption. If you withhold or redact any information that should have been released or provide an inadequate response, I will be forced to take legal action and file a complaint in court.\r\n\r\nI would like to point out some relevant local court cases to support my request. The Florida Supreme Court in Times Publishing Co. v. City of St. Petersburg, 558 So. 2d 487, 493 (Fla. 1990) held that the Public Records Law must be construed liberally in favor of open access to public records, and that exemptions must be strictly construed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal in State v. City of Deerfield Beach, 426 So. 2d 1332, 1336 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983) emphasized that agencies have a duty to search all of their files for responsive records, and cannot limit their search to only certain files or categories.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This will help ensure that I receive responsive records in a timely manner and allow me to more effectively manage and prioritize the review of the records.To the extent that records are withheld or redacted, I ask that you provide the specific legal basis for the withholding or redaction, and that you provide any segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. In addition, I remind you that FOIA requires agencies to produce records in their entirety, even if portions of the records are exempt from disclosure. See, e.g., Bevis v. Department of State, 801 F.2d 1386, 1389 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (stating that an agency must \"release all reasonably segregable portions of [the] record\").\r\n\r\nI also remind you that FOIA requires agencies to disclose records even if they have been deleted or improperly redacted. See, e.g., Payne Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 486, 488 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (stating that an agency must \"conduct a reasonable search for records, and cannot limit its search to only those records that it believes to be intact\").\r\n\r\nIf any records responsive to this request have been destroyed, deleted, or otherwise disposed of, I ask that you provide the following information:\r\n\r\nThe date and circumstances of the disposal or destruction;\r\n\r\nThe name, title, and position of the person who authorized the disposal or destruction;\r\n\r\nThe name, title, and position of the person or persons responsible for carrying out the disposal or destruction;\r\n\r\nThe procedures that were followed for disposing of or destroying the records; and\r\n\r\nA description of the records that were destroyed or disposed of.\r\n\r\nFinally, I remind you that FOIA provides for attorney's fees and litigation costs to be awarded to a prevailing plaintiff. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E). Therefore, I urge you to comply fully with this request and to respond within the statutory time frame.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",

This request includes metadata associated with the records, such as author, date, and time of creation.\r\n\r\nAs a requester, I would like to bring to your attention that it is crucial to read this request carefully and provide the requested information in a complete and accurate manner. Failure to do so may result in legal action, including filing a complaint with the New York State Committee on Open Government or a court of law, in order to compel the production of the requested records.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that this request is properly processed, I ask that you carefully review the details of this request, including the scope of documents and information being requested, the timeframe for the requested records, and the specific key string searches to be conducted. If any clarification is needed, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent reports have indicated that Governor Hochul has received numerous threats of violence and harm since taking office, including on social media platforms such as Twitter. As a concerned citizen and advocate for transparency, I request access to any documents, emails, or other information in the possession of the New York State Police and their Counter Terrorism Unit that relate to these threats, including any information gathered through electronic surveillance or other investigative methods.\r\n\r\nTo assist in the search for responsive records, I request that the following keystring searches be conducted:\r\n\r\n\"Kathy Hochul\"\r\n\"Governor Hochul\"\r\n\"threats\"\r\n\"violence\"\r\n\"harm\"\r\n\"social media\"\r\n\"Twitter\"\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that this request includes not only records related to direct threats against Governor Hochul, but also any records related to the New York State Police's response to such threats, including any investigations, protective measures, or communications with other law enforcement agencies or government entities. The Counter Terrorism Unit is included in this request due to their expertise in responding to threats against public officials.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is denied or exempt from disclosure, please cite the specific exemption and provide an index of the withheld or redacted records, as required by law.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold or delete responsive documents will be appealed in a court of law. Any such actions may result in legal proceedings to compel the production of the records and any applicable penalties. I also request that any responsive records be provided on a rolling basis, meaning that records should be provided as they become available instead of waiting for all records to be collected before responding to the request.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer to the following court cases and legal principles:\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Law (FOIL), Public Officers Law Article 6: This law requires the government to provide access to records maintained by government entities.\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004): This case held that FOIA requires agencies to disclose records unless the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption.\r\n\r\nNewsday LLC v. Empire State Development Corporation, 98 A.D.3d 36, 944 N.Y.S.2d 78 (2d Dept. 2012): This case held that \"an agency must identify which exemption(s) it asserts to justify withholding the requested information, and state in a conclusory fashion how the exemption applies to the particular documents or parts thereof.\"\r\n\r\nMatter of Johnson v. N.Y. State Police, 196 A.D.2d 794, 601 N.Y.S.2d 64 (3d Dept. 1993): This case held that \"an agency cannot simply deny access to documents or information sought under FOIL by invoking a statutory exemption; rather, the agency has the burden of demonstrating that the exemption applies to the material in question.\"\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This request includes metadata associated with the records, such as author, date, and time of creation.\r\n\r\nRecent reports have indicated that Governor DeSantis has received numerous threats of violence and harm during his time in office. As a concerned citizen and advocate for transparency, I request access to any documents, emails, or other information in the possession of the Governor's Office of Florida that relate to these threats.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer to the following court cases and legal principles:\r\n\r\nSoucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067 (D.C. Cir. 1971): This case held that the public has a strong interest in obtaining information about government activities, including any threats made against public officials.\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004): This case held that FOIA requires agencies to disclose records unless the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption.\r\n\r\nFOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Pub. L. No. 114-185, 130 Stat. 538 (2016): This law updated and strengthened the Freedom of Information Act, emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in government and requiring agencies to proactively disclose certain records to the public.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in a readable electronic format, such as PDF or Microsoft Word, and include the metadata associated with the records. If any portion of this request is denied or exempt from disclosure, please cite the specific exemption and provide an index of the withheld or redacted records, as required by law.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold or delete responsive documents will be appealed in a court of law. Any such actions may result in legal proceedings to compel the production of the records and any applicable penalties. I also request that any responsive records be provided on a rolling basis, meaning that records should be provided as they become available instead of waiting for all records to be collected before responding to the request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I also request access to any audio and video recordings related to the accident.\r\n\r\nOn November 12, 2022, a mid-air collision occurred during the Dallas Airshow, which was being held at Dallas Executive Airport. According to news reports, a vintage World War II-era aircraft collided with a modern aerobatic plane, resulting in the deaths of both pilots. The incident occurred in front of a large crowd of spectators, many of whom captured video footage of the collision.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the NTSB's investigation and promote transparency, I request access to the following documents, memos, reports, and any other information related to the accident, as well as any audio and video recordings that capture the accident or events leading up to it:\r\n\r\nPreliminary and final accident reports;\r\nTechnical and factual reports;\r\nRecords of witness statements and interviews;\r\nAir traffic control communications;\r\nMaintenance and inspection records for the aircraft involved;\r\nAny correspondence or communication between the NTSB and other parties regarding the accident;\r\nPhotographs and videos of the accident scene and wreckage;\r\nAny other documents or information related to the accident;\r\nAny audio or video recordings that capture the accident or events leading up to it.\r\nPlease provide these records and recordings in a readable electronic format, such as PDF, Microsoft Word, or MP4.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is denied or exempt from disclosure, please cite the specific exemption and provide an index of the withheld or redacted records, as required by law.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold or delete responsive documents and recordings will be appealed in a court of law. Any such actions may result in legal proceedings to compel the production of the records and recordings and any applicable penalties. I also request that any responsive records and recordings be provided on a rolling basis, meaning that records and recordings should be provided as they become available instead of waiting for all records and recordings to be collected before responding to the request.\r\n\r\nThis request is made in the public interest and is intended to promote transparency and accountability in government.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan",

The events of January 6th were an unprecedented attack on the U.S. Capitol, resulting in multiple deaths, injuries, and significant damage to the Capitol building. This incident has generated significant public interest and raised questions about national security, law enforcement response, and the role of extremist groups in planning and executing the attack.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am interested in the following information:\r\n\r\nPre-intelligence knowledge: Records and communications that detail any information the FBI had prior to January 6, 2021, regarding potential threats, plans, or coordination related to the insurrection.\r\nPlanning, coordination, and execution: Records that detail the planning, coordination, and execution of the event.\r\nInvestigations and prosecutions: Records related to any investigations and prosecutions that have resulted from the insurrection.\r\nPost-event information: Records and analysis of the insurrection's impact on national security, law enforcement response, lessons learned, and any related policy changes or recommendations.\r\nPlease include any information obtained through cross-references, ELSUR (Electronic Surveillance) records, and interagency communications. Additionally, I request a search for records containing the following keywords: \"January 6th,\" \"Capitol,\" \"insurrection,\" \"riot,\" \"protest,\" \"QAnon,\" \"Proud Boys,\" \"Oath Keepers,\" and any other terms relevant to the event.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA statute and subsequent case law support the public's right to access these records. In Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), the Supreme Court recognized that the purpose of the FOIA is to \"open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.\" Furthermore, in Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73 (1973), the Court emphasized that FOIA \"mandates a policy of broad disclosure of government documents.\"\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is denied or exempt from disclosure, please cite the specific exemption and provide an index of the withheld or redacted records, as required by law. Be advised that any attempt to withhold, destroy, or redact information without proper justification may result in legal action to enforce compliance with the FOIA.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
