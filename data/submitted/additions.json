My request pertains to reports, investigations, and litigation concerning incidents of sexual misconduct over the past five years.\r\n\r\nI am specifically requesting access to the following categories of information:\r\n\r\nIncident Reports: All incident reports or complaints of sexual misconduct involving students, including those filed by the students themselves or others on their behalf.\r\nInvestigation Outcomes: Detailed records of any investigations undertaken in response to these reports, including the findings (such as sustained, not founded, inconclusive, etc.), any actions taken by the university, and the outcomes of any subsequent appeals.\r\nLitigation: Records of all litigation and court proceedings related to these incidents of sexual misconduct. This includes not only the cases initiated by the university or individual students but also any related court cases that support the premise that such information should be released under FOIA, such as case law establishing or affirming the public's right to access this type of information.\r\nPolicy Changes: Any revisions or amendments made to the university's policies, guidelines, or procedures concerning sexual misconduct over the last five years in response to these incidents.\r\nAs allowed under the New York State Freedom of Information Law, I request that these documents be produced on a rolling basis, meaning as they become available. Pursuant to New York State Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a), I ask that the State University of New York at Albany make a good faith effort to provide the records as they are located and reviewed, rather than waiting to release all records at once.\r\n\r\nI am not requesting access to personally identifiable information or other confidential details that would infringe upon the privacy rights of individuals involved. Please redact such information in compliance with the law while still providing the relevant data about the incidents and their outcomes.\r\n\r\nIf any part of my request is denied, I kindly ask you to provide a written explanation citing the specific legal reasons for the denial. If any aspect of my request is unclear or needs further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",
