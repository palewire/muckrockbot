Current policies, rules and practices related to access to make outgoing and receive incoming telephone calls that apply to youth at DYS Middleton - Northeast Regional Youth Service Center and for other facilities and programs in the DYS Northeast region, including sub-contractors, including Strive and Bright Futures.  This includes youth access to facility phones and to personal cell phones. It also includes who they can call and how that is determined, and frequency and duration of calls allowed.\r\n\r\n2. Current policies, rules and practices related to in-person visits, both frequency and duration, that apply to youth at DYS Middleton - Northeast Regional Youth Service Center and other facilities and programs in the DYS Northeast region, including sub-contractors, including Strive and Bright Futures. This includes who can visit and how that is determined. This also includes any access to video visits.\r\n\r\n3. Any additional information relevant to assessing whether DYS Northeast Region phone and visiting policies are in fact significantly more limiting and restrictive than all Massachusetts jails and prisons and the impact this has on teenagers trying to maintain and build strong relationships with family and loved ones.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBetsey Chace",
