If possible, please provide this data in database or spreadsheet format and include the case number, incident date, incident time, subject injured indicator, subject injury force related info (e.g. Yes or No), subject age, subject gender, subject ethnicity, subject weapon type, incident area occurred, force type, officer division (e.g. law enforcement operations, detention/correctional operations, etc.), badge number and names associated with the officers involved. If one or more of these fields or dates is unavailable, provide all fields and/or information that is available responsive to my request. If no database or spreadsheet format is available, please provide copies of each individual use of force report or other report where use of force information is documented/reported by officers.
