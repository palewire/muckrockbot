Mecham was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, making all related law enforcement records subject to public disclosure.\r\n\r\nI formally demand the preservation of all responsive records, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tBody-worn camera footage\r\n\t\u2022\tDashcam recordings\r\n\t\u2022\t911 call recordings and transcripts\r\n\t\u2022\tPolice dispatch logs\r\n\t\u2022\tArrest reports and investigative files\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal police communications related to the case\r\n\r\nDestroying, altering, or withholding these records without legal justification could constitute a violation of public records law and a due process violation under Chaudhry v. City of Los Angeles, 751 F.3d 1096 (9th Cir. 2014). Further, Public Citizen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989) reaffirms the public\u2019s right to government transparency.\r\n\r\n1. Body-Worn Camera (BWC) Footage\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll footage from officers who responded to Sidney Mecham\u2019s incident on June 10, 2023.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 133.741 requires law enforcement to retain and disclose BWC footage unless exempt.\r\n\t\u2022\tACLU of Nevada v.

Arrest and Booking Reports\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tComplete arrest and booking reports related to Mecham\u2019s case, including officer narratives.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 192.345(3) mandates disclosure of completed law enforcement reports.\r\n\t\u2022\tAfshar v. Dept. of State, 702 F.2d 1125 (D.C. Cir. 1983) held that agencies must disclose non-exempt portions of law enforcement records.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.345(3)\r\n\r\n6.

Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989) held that government information disclosure fosters accountability.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.324(5)\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records\r\n\r\nI formally demand that all responsive records be preserved under:\r\n\t\u2022\t44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3106 (prohibiting unlawful destruction of public records).\r\n\t\u2022\t5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (ensuring preservation of records subject to FOIA requests).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide:\r\n\t\u2022\tA written explanation citing the specific FOIA exemptions invoked.\r\n\t\u2022\tAll segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request and provide an estimated timeline for processing.
