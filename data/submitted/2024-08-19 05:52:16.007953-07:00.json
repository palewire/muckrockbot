        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to Louis de Wohl, aka Ludwig von Wohl, aka Theodor Gaspar Adolf Wohl (January 24, 1903 - June 2, 1961). Mr. De Wohl was a German-born but Hungarian-raised astrologer who emigrated to Great Britain in 1935. A few years later, in 1941, Mr. De Wohl was sent to the United States by the Special Operations Executive, a British intelligence service, to convince Americans that the United States should join World War II, and while there, his tour was overseen by the British Security Coordination (BSC), a separate British intelligence service based out of New York City. The FBI and the BSC worked closely during this period, sharing intelligence on potential security threats, such as the 1939 \"Joe K\" spy ring out of Bermuda which was controlled by German spy Kurt Frederick Ludwig.\r\n\r\nMr. De Wohl's work on behalf of British intelligence was chronicled in a 2017 Daily Beast article titled \"Louis de Wohl: The Astrologer Who Helped Foil Hitler\": https://www.thedailybeast.com/louis-de-wohl-the-astrologer-who-helped-foil-hitler\r\n\r\nThe BSC's connection to Mr. De Wohl was documented in a separate 2006 Guardian article titled \"The Secret Persuaders\": https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/19/military.secondworldwar\r\n\r\nProof of death is not required as Mr. De Wohl's date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with respect to the FBI's collaborations with foreign intelligence services. Mr. De Wohl was a foreign intelligence officer operating inside the United States as part of a propaganda campaign organized by British intelligence services, one of which, the BSC, shared intelligence with the FBI in that same period. The FBI's involvement in, or knowledge of, any efforts to lobby the American public on the subject of entry into World War II prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor would contribute significantly to public understanding of America's role in that conflict.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny bureau records related to the controversial writer Victor Jerome Banis (born May 25th, 1937 - died February 22nd, 2019).  Banis was a famous and controversial writer of gay themed fiction whose death was widely reported in the media. \r\n\r\nIn the 1960s he was was indicted by a federal grand jury in Sioux City on obscenity charges due to lesbian themes in his \"The Affairs of Gloria\" novel. This indictment would have likely generated FBI documentation of the novel \"The Affairs of Gloria.\" Following his acquittal, and due in part to his anger at the government, Banis began incorporating gay themes into dozens of books that he published under different pseudonyms.\r\n\r\nA description of his life and career can be found online here: https://www.pulpcurry.com/2019/03/farewell-to-victor-j-banis-pioneer-of-gay-pulp-popular-fiction/\r\n\r\nHere is a list of pseudonyms he used during his writing career:\r\nVictor Jay\r\nJ. X. Williams\r\nJay Vickery\r\nJan Alexander\r\nLynn Benedict\r\nV. J. Banis\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the writer Victor J. Banis (including all pseudonyms)  from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Banis held by the Sioux City Satellite \"resident agency\" Office, the Martinsburg Satellite \"resident agency\" Office which likely maintained files on Banis. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Victor J. Banis. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Victor J. Banis.\r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Victor J. Banis. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThe release of records held by the bureau would benefit the historical record. Thank you for the bureau's commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A); 49 CFR \u00a7 7.24(d). Your request, as described, seeks 51 years and 7 months' worth of records. This is a significant amount of information and is too broad and complex in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the FOIA and agency regulations, the agency is not required to process requests that require an unreasonably burdensome search. FRA asks that you reformulate and/or narrow the scope of your request (e.g. provide a shorter time frame; prioritize the subject matter that you would like to receive first), to limit the burden on the agency. You may visit FRA's website to search for and locate documents that may assist you in better defining the scope of your request at https://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/officeofsafety/ (e.g. railroad accident data or reports, including railroad supplied accident reports for specific accidents).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, FRA records retention periods vary depending upon the specific type of records, also are available for public on the NARA site: Records Control Schedules | National Archives<https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/rcs/schedules/index.html?dir=/departments/department-of-transportation/rg-0399>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease provide a response within 7 calendar days of the date of this email. If we do not receive a response from you, we will administratively close your request without further notice.\nRegards,\r\nSyreeta Jackson\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nOffice of the Chief Counsel (RCC)\r\nFederal Railroad Administration",

Alameda Parkway\r\nAurora, CO 80012\r\n\r\nAttn: Records Department, Code Enforcement Office, City Manager\u2019s Office, Legal Counsel\r\n\r\nSubject: Colorado Open Records Act Request \u2013 Code Enforcement Activity, Coordination with City Officials, and Media Staging Area at 1568 Nome Street, Aurora, CO on August 13, 2024\r\n\r\nNOTICE: This request involves specific records from multiple departments within the City of Aurora, including the Code Enforcement Office, City Manager\u2019s Office, and Legal Counsel. Please read carefully and direct the request to the appropriate offices.\r\n\r\nDear Records Custodian,\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA), C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-201 et seq., I hereby request access to and copies of records held by the City of Aurora related to the code enforcement activity at the apartment complex located at 1568 Nome Street, Aurora, CO 80010, on Tuesday, August 13, 2024, starting around 7:30 AM. This request pertains specifically to the activities and communications involving the Code Enforcement Office, the City Manager\u2019s Office, and the City\u2019s Legal Counsel.\r\n\r\nRecords Requested\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, I seek the following records:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tInspection Reports:\r\nAll reports generated in connection with the code enforcement activity at 1568 Nome Street on the specified date. This includes inspection findings, any observed violations, and notes on follow-up actions or recommendations for further enforcement.\r\nDepartments Involved: Code Enforcement Office.\r\nLegal Basis: These documents are public records as defined by C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)(a), with a presumption of openness as established in People v. Thompson, 181 Colo. 194, 509 P.2d 592 (1973).\r\n\t2.\tNotices of Violation and Enforcement Actions:\r\nCopies of all notices of violation, orders, or other formal enforcement actions issued by the Code Enforcement Office as a result of the inspection at the above location. This includes any communications with property owners or management regarding required corrective actions.\r\nDepartments Involved: Code Enforcement Office.\r\nLegal Basis: Notices and enforcement actions are public records under CORA (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)). The Colorado Supreme Court has supported the public\u2019s right to access these records in Freedom Newspapers, Inc. v. Tollefson, 961 P.2d 1150 (Colo. 1998).\r\n\t3.\tInternal and External Communications:\r\nAll communications related to the code enforcement activity at 1568 Nome Street, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal communications within the Code Enforcement Office regarding the planning, execution, and follow-up of the inspection.\r\n\t\u2022\tCommunications between the Code Enforcement Office and the City Manager\u2019s Office discussing the enforcement activity, any anticipated legal issues, or coordination efforts.\r\n\t\u2022\tCommunications between the Code Enforcement Office and the City\u2019s Legal Counsel, including discussions on potential legal implications, enforcement strategies, or responses to inquiries.\r\nDepartments Involved: Code Enforcement Office, City Manager\u2019s Office, Legal Counsel.\r\nLegal Basis: These communications are considered public records under C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)(a)(I). Transparency in government operations is a key principle supported by the U.S. Supreme Court in NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978).\r\n\t4.\tEmail Metadata:\r\nDetailed metadata for all emails related to the above communications, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tSender and recipient information.\r\n\t\u2022\tDate and time stamps.\r\n\t\u2022\tSubject lines.\r\n\t\u2022\tDescriptions or filenames of any attachments.\r\nDepartments Involved: Code Enforcement Office, City Manager\u2019s Office, Legal Counsel.\r\nLegal Basis: Email metadata is part of the public record under CORA (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(7)). This has been affirmed in cases such as O\u2019Neill v. City of Shoreline, 170 Wash. 2d 138 (2010), where metadata was deemed necessary for transparency.\r\n\t5.\tPhotographs and Video Recordings:\r\nAny photographs or video recordings taken during the code enforcement inspection at 1568 Nome Street, including those documenting conditions, violations, or interactions with property representatives.\r\nDepartments Involved: Code Enforcement Office.\r\nLegal Basis: Visual records created by government employees during official duties are public records under CORA (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)(a)(I)). The importance of these records for public accountability was highlighted in ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012).\r\n\t6.\tDocuments and Communications Regarding Media Staging Area:\r\nAll documents, memos, or communications related to the designation or use of a media staging area during the code enforcement activity at 1568 Nome Street. This includes any directives or guidelines for media access, communications regarding media presence, and decisions to restrict or manage media coverage.\r\nDepartments Involved: Code Enforcement Office, City Manager\u2019s Office, Legal Counsel.\r\nLegal Basis: Records related to media access during public operations are subject to public disclosure under CORA (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)). The U.S. Supreme Court in Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980), underscored the importance of public and media access to government activities.\r\n\r\nRequest for Segregable Non-Exempt Portions\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-204(3)(a). The principle of releasing non-exempt portions is well-established in Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that you are legally obligated to preserve all records potentially responsive to this request. The U.S. Supreme Court emphasized the prohibition against unlawful withholding, redaction, or destruction of records in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with MuckRock.com, I believe the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest, contributing significantly to public understanding of government operations. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), such a waiver is justified.\r\n\r\nIf the fee waiver is not granted and there are anticipated charges exceeding $200, please notify me before processing the request.\r\n\r\nPublic Availability of Communications\r\n\r\nPlease note: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing messages, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Correspondence in relation to this request will be published immediately on the platform.\r\n\r\nAs required by CORA, I look forward to your response within the statutory time frame of three business days (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-203(3)(b)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nMuckRock.com\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter",

On August 13, 2024 you requested the following: \r\n\r\nDate: August 13, 2024 \r\n\r\nCity of Aurora \r\n15151 E. Alameda Parkway \r\nAurora, CO 80012 \r\n\r\nAttn: Records Department, Code Enforcement Office, City Manager\u2019s Office, Legal Counsel \r\n\r\nSubject: Colorado Open Records Act Request \u2013 Code Enforcement Activity, Coordination with City Officials, and Media Staging Area at 1568 Nome Street, Aurora, CO on August 13, 2024 \r\n\r\nNOTICE: This request involves specific records from multiple departments within the City of Aurora, including the Code Enforcement Office, City Manager\u2019s Office, and Legal Counsel. Please read carefully and direct the request to the appropriate offices. \r\n\r\nDear Records Custodian, \r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA), C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-201 et seq., I hereby request access to and copies of records held by the City of Aurora related to the code enforcement activity at the apartment complex located at 1568 Nome Street, Aurora, CO 80010, on Tuesday, August 13, 2024, starting around 7:30 AM. This request pertains specifically to the activities and communications involving the Code Enforcement Office, the City Manager\u2019s Office, and the City\u2019s Legal Counsel. \r\n\r\nRecords Requested \r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, I seek the following records: \r\n\r\n1. Inspection Reports: \r\nAll reports generated in connection with the code enforcement activity at 1568 Nome Street on the specified date. This includes inspection findings, any observed violations, and notes on follow-up actions or recommendations for further enforcement. \r\nDepartments Involved: Code Enforcement Office. \r\nLegal Basis: These documents are public records as defined by C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)(a), with a presumption of openness as established in People v. Thompson, 181 Colo. 194, 509 P.2d 592 (1973). \r\n2. Notices of Violation and Enforcement Actions: \r\nCopies of all notices of violation, orders, or other formal enforcement actions issued by the Code Enforcement Office as a result of the inspection at the above location. This includes any communications with property owners or management regarding required corrective actions. \r\nDepartments Involved: Code Enforcement Office. \r\nLegal Basis: Notices and enforcement actions are public records under CORA (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)). The Colorado Supreme Court has supported the public\u2019s right to access these records in Freedom Newspapers, Inc. v. Tollefson, 961 P.2d 1150 (Colo. 1998). \r\n3. Internal and External Communications: \r\nAll communications related to the code enforcement activity at 1568 Nome Street, including: \r\n\u2022 Internal communications within the Code Enforcement Office regarding the planning, execution, and follow-up of the inspection. \r\n\u2022 Communications between the Code Enforcement Office and the City Manager\u2019s Office discussing the enforcement activity, any anticipated legal issues, or coordination efforts. \r\n\u2022 Communications between the Code Enforcement Office and the City\u2019s Legal Counsel, including discussions on potential legal implications, enforcement strategies, or responses to inquiries. \r\nDepartments Involved: Code Enforcement Office, City Manager\u2019s Office, Legal Counsel. \r\nLegal Basis: These communications are considered public records under C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)(a)(I). Transparency in government operations is a key principle supported by the U.S. Supreme Court in NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978). \r\n4. Email Metadata: \r\nDetailed metadata for all emails related to the above communications, including but not limited to: \r\n\u2022 Sender and recipient information. \r\n\u2022 Date and time stamps. \r\n\u2022 Subject lines. \r\n\u2022 Descriptions or filenames of any attachments. \r\nDepartments Involved: Code Enforcement Office, City Manager\u2019s Office, Legal Counsel. \r\nLegal Basis: Email metadata is part of the public record under CORA (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(7)). This has been affirmed in cases such as O\u2019Neill v. City of Shoreline, 170 Wash. 2d 138 (2010), where metadata was deemed necessary for transparency. \r\n5. Photographs and Video Recordings: \r\nAny photographs or video recordings taken during the code enforcement inspection at 1568 Nome Street, including those documenting conditions, violations, or interactions with property representatives. \r\nDepartments Involved: Code Enforcement Office. \r\nLegal Basis: Visual records created by government employees during official duties are public records under CORA (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)(a)(I)). The importance of these records for public accountability was highlighted in ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012). \r\n6. Documents and Communications Regarding Media Staging Area: \r\nAll documents, memos, or communications related to the designation or use of a media staging area during the code enforcement activity at 1568 Nome Street. This includes any directives or guidelines for media access, communications regarding media presence, and decisions to restrict or manage media coverage. \r\nDepartments Involved: Code Enforcement Office, City Manager\u2019s Office, Legal Counsel. \r\nLegal Basis: Records related to media access during public operations are subject to public disclosure under CORA (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)). The U.S. Supreme Court in Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980), underscored the importance of public and media access to government activities. \r\n\r\nRequest for Segregable Non-Exempt Portions \r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-204(3)(a). The principle of releasing non-exempt portions is well-established in Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). \r\n\r\nPreservation of Records \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that you are legally obligated to preserve all records potentially responsive to this request. The U.S. Supreme Court emphasized the prohibition against unlawful withholding, redaction, or destruction of records in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980). \r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request \r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with MuckRock.com, I believe the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest, contributing significantly to public understanding of government operations. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), such a waiver is justified. \r\n\r\nIf the fee waiver is not granted and there are anticipated charges exceeding $200, please notify me before processing the request. \r\n\r\nPublic Availability of Communications \r\n\r\nPlease note: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing messages, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Correspondence in relation to this request will be published immediately on the platform. \r\n\r\nAs required by CORA, I look forward to your response within the statutory time frame of three business days (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-203(3)(b)). \r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nJordan Lassiter \r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist \r\nMuckRock.com \r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter \r\n\r\nAttachments: \r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/TheJ/144017/Fee_Waiver_Letter_copy.docx \r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fcity-of-aurora-17174%252Fcolorado-open-records-act-request-code-enforcement-activity-coordination-with-city-officials-and-media-staging-area-at-1568-nome-street-171801%252F%253Femail%253Dmayorsoffice%252540aurora-il.org&url_auth_token=AABSIGvEwWS7-wykiiyLrVcEuok%3A1se3bB%3A5xrYg_vw7q4-FIdL7QKRC9P6_dOkTseCgjTpOScRMKE \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the City of Aurora, Illinois, has no records responsive to your request. \r\n\r\nYou have the right to have this denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).

Alameda Parkway\r\nAurora, CO 80012\r\n\r\nAttn: Records Department\r\n\r\nSubject: Colorado Open Records Act Request \u2013 Police Presence, Code Enforcement Coordination, and Media Staging Area at 1568 Nome Street, Aurora, CO on August 13, 2024\r\n\r\nDear Records Custodian,\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA), C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-201 et seq., and relevant federal transparency laws, I hereby request access to and copies of records held by the Aurora Police Department related to the police presence at the apartment complex located at 1568 Nome Street, Aurora, CO 80010, on Tuesday, August 13, 2024, starting around 7:30 AM.\r\n\r\nRecords Requested\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tIncident Reports: All reports generated in connection with the police activity at the above location and time.\r\nLegal Basis: Under CORA, public records include any writings made, maintained, or kept by the state or its agencies, including incident reports (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)(a)). In People v. Thompson, 181 Colo. 194, 509 P.2d 592 (1973), the court held that such records are presumptively open to the public.\r\n\t2.\tInternal Memos, Emails, and Communications: All internal communications, including memos, emails, and other correspondences, related to the planning, execution, or follow-up of the police presence at this location. This specifically includes:\r\n\t\u2022\tCommunications between the Aurora Police Department and the City of Aurora Code Enforcement Office.\r\n\t\u2022\tCommunications between the Aurora Police Department and the City Manager\u2019s Office.\r\n\t\u2022\tCommunications between the Aurora Police Department and the Aurora City Council members.\r\nLegal Basis: Emails and internal memos are public records under CORA (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)(a)(I)). The U.S. Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of transparency in government operations in NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978).\r\n\t3.\tEmail Metadata: Detailed metadata for all emails related to the above communications, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tSender and recipient details.\r\n\t\u2022\tDate and time stamps.\r\n\t\u2022\tSubject lines.\r\n\t\u2022\tAttachments and their descriptions (if applicable).\r\nLegal Basis: Metadata is considered a part of the public record under CORA (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(7)). In O\u2019Neill v. City of Shoreline, 170 Wash. 2d 138 (2010), the court ruled that metadata associated with emails is subject to disclosure as part of the public record.\r\n\t4.\tBody-Worn Camera Footage: All body-worn camera footage from officers present at the scene during the specified time.\r\nLegal Basis: Body camera footage is considered a public record under C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-303. Court decisions such as ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012), highlight the public\u2019s interest in transparency and accountability in police actions.\r\n\t5.\tDispatch Audio: Recordings of all 911 calls and dispatch communications related to this incident.\r\nLegal Basis: Dispatch audio is subject to disclosure under C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)(a)(I). In City of Colorado Springs v. White, 967 P.2d 1042 (Colo. 1998), the Colorado Supreme Court confirmed that such records must be made available unless specifically exempt.\r\n\t6.\tDrone Footage: Any drone footage captured during the operation at this location.\r\nLegal Basis: Drone footage falls under the same public record criteria as other visual recordings made by law enforcement (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)). The New York Times Co. v. DOJ, 756 F.3d 100 (2d Cir. 2014), reinforces the need for transparency in government surveillance activities.\r\n\t7.\tDocuments, Memos, or Communications Regarding the Media Staging Area: Any records related to the designation or use of a staging area for the media during the operation at the above location. This includes directives related to restricting media access or removal of the media from the area.\r\nLegal Basis: Records regarding media staging areas fall under public access under CORA (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-202(6)). The U.S. Supreme Court in Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980), affirmed the public and media\u2019s right to access government proceedings, which extends to law enforcement activities in public spaces.\r\n\r\nRequest for Segregable Non-Exempt Portions\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-204(3)(a). In Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), the court established the principle that agencies must provide detailed justification for each exemption and release any segregable portions of records.\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. The U.S. Supreme Court in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980), emphasized that any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of FOIA and is subject to litigation.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with MuckRock.com, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), such information warrants a fee waiver.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nPublic Availability of Communications\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request will be instantly published on the platform.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by CORA, I look forward to your response within the statutory time frame of three business days (C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-203(3)(b)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nMuckRock.com\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter",
