If access cannot be provided within 15 business days, the public body shall cite 1 of the reasons hereunder why more time is needed and provide a good-faith estimate of how much additional time is required to fulfill the request.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nTammy Stock\r\nFOIA Coordinator \u2013 Delaware Department of State\n",
