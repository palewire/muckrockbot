Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2018.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, title, department or agency, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status, and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

I would greatly appreciate if you could either provide clarify the points below or put me in touch with someone who can assist. \r\n\r\n1) Does the gross payroll variable include compensatory and overtime pay?\r\n2) In the earliest datasets (from 2010 and 2011, for instance), there are two date variables: start date and class date. I understand the former to mean the date that someone started working for the state and the latter to mean the date someone started working in their particular role. In the later datasets, however, there are three date variables: continuous service date, job code start date, and term date. I understand that term date means the date the employee left the state workforce, but I am unsure about the first two date variables (I cannot find documentation for these variables). Can you please let me know what continuous service date and job code start date mean?\r\n3) Finally, could you please include a file that provides definitions of the variables in the enterprise personnel report? There are variables, such as EEO4 code and DP Unit Code that are difficult to understand without additional documentation. \r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time and assistance. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nBen",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Goehring:\r\n\r\nThis is in response to your November 6, 2022 email seeking additional information about our September 21, 2022 response to your July 25, 2022 records request.  The answers to your questions are provided in red, below:\r\n\r\n1) Does the gross payroll variable include compensatory and overtime pay? Gross payroll includes the amount included in the overtime column. The Compensatory Time columns are not presented in dollar amounts but are rather the hours that were earned by the employee in the year.  If the employee used any of those hours to take leave during the calendar year, payment for those hours would be included in the gross amount in the same manner as any other leave type used.\r\n2) In the earliest datasets (from 2010 and 2011, for instance), there are two date variables: start date and class date. I understand the former to mean the date that someone started working for the state and the latter to mean the date someone started working in their particular role. In the later datasets, however, there are three date variables: continuous service date, job code start date, and term date. I understand that term date means the date the employee left the state workforce, but I am unsure about the first two date variables (I cannot find documentation for these variables). Can you please let me know what continuous service date and job code start date mean?\r\n*Continuous Service Date \u2013 The date on which an employee\u2019s current period of continuous service with the state is considered to have begun, with deductions for authorized breaks in service. For employees who have had no break in service, this will be their original start date.\r\n*Job Code Start Date \u2013 This is the same as the class date in the earlier datasets.  Each classification is identified by a job code (formerly known as class code)\r\n\r\n3) Finally, could you please include a file that provides definitions of the variables in the enterprise personnel report? There are variables, such as EEO4 code and DP Unit Code that are difficult to understand without additional documentation.\r\n* The State Alphabetical Listing of Classifications provides additional information https://dpm.wi.gov/Documents/BCER/alphalst.xlsx - This file is updated regularly to reflect the current classification structure for the State.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D9316D.F3118BF0]<https://doa.wi.gov/>\r\n\r\nPatricia Reardon | Program & Policy Analyst\r\nDepartment of Administration\r\nDivision of Legal Services\r\nPatricia.Reardon@wisconsin.gov\r\nDirect: (608) 264-9595\n",

        "communication": "Dear Tom Nash:\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS), Division of Child Support Enforcement (DCSE) is responding to your request received on January 19, 2023, made in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requesting the following information.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Does DCSE collect any fees related to servicing the incarcerated youth?\r\n\r\nDCSE is responsible for establishing paternity as well as establishing, modifying, enforcing, and collecting child support obligations. See Va. Code \u00a7 63.2-100 (defining child support services). Prior to July 1, 2021, the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) would apply for child support services when a child was placed in custody. DJJ no longer applies for services on new placements, but DCSE continues to collect arrearages due prior to July 1, 2021. Pursuant to Va. Code \u00a7 63.2-1904, DCSE charges a $35 annual fee on DJJ cases. DCSE deducts that fee from additional child support collections after having first collected and disbursed at least $550 during the federal fiscal year. Fees that we may collect directly from a parent, such as the cost of genetic testing, are the result of our mission as the child support agency and are not related to the services being provided to the justice-involved youth. For a full discussion of child support fees, see Chapter 11, Section 10 of our Program Manual, available to the public at https://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/dcse/program_manual/Program_Manual.pdf.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  All reports, databases, spreadsheets, or equivalent materials regarding debts/restitution paid to or owed to this department or any facility/agency under its jurisdiction in FY2021. Please include all relevant data regarding medical and room & board costs, including the number of youths (i.e., juveniles) charged for medical and room & board costs or fees and the total amount of medical and room & board fees imposed in FY2021.\r\n\r\nDCSE is responsible for the establishment and collection of child support obligations, some of which are payable to DJJ.  Those obligations are set according to the child support guidelines and are unrelated to the costs assessed for care. DCSE does not track medical or room and board costs for justice-involved youth.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nS.

If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

We appreciate your frustration with the delay in our ability to respond to your request, and apologize that we are not able to give you a more precise estimate of when you can expect to receive our response. At this time, our general expectation is that, we will be able to send you a final response in the next three to four\u00a0 months. \n\nPlease understand that our office handles a very large volume of requests \u2013 in one month we respond to more requests on average than most Departments receive in a year.  In addition to handling a large volume of requests, we are also responsible for processing a variety of particularly sensitive types of records.  We have a responsibility to ensure that we carefully review all of the records we process to ensure that we provide maximum transparency while withholding any exempt material that could foreseeably cause harm to a protected interest.  This is a labor intensive task that involves working with offices to ensure that any potentially responsive materials are provided to us and then conducting a page-by-page and line-by-line review of all responsive records. \n\nOCIO has provided us with potentially responsive records and your request has been added to our processing queue.  It is very difficult to provide an accurate estimated date of completion until our FOIA analyst reviews these records for responsiveness and we have a better sense of the number of pages and the sensitivity of the material.  The Privacy Office is also coordinating the Department\u2019s response to requests related to COVID-19; many of these requesters asked and qualified for expedited processing, meaning that they are required to be placed at the front of the queue.  Again, our general expectation is that we will be able to send you a final response within three to four months.  Please know that this estimate may change dramatically based on the volume of work associated with our expedited COVID-19 requests and on the types of records that OCIO has provided us for your request.  Regardless of the specificity of your request, we cannot accurately estimate the amount of time it will take to process the record until we understand both the volume and sensitivity of the record. \n\nWhile we make every effort to be responsive to requesters and hope to be able to respond to you sooner, there may be additional delays. \n\nI hope that this response provides additional insight into why we are not able to give you a more precise estimated date of completion, and why we expect it will take three to four months for us to respond to your request.  Please let us know if you have any other questions about our processes. \n\nRespectfully, \n\nDHS Privacy Office \nDisclosure and FOIA Program \nSTOP 0655 \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE \nWashington, DC 20032 \nTelephone: 1-866-431-0486 or 202-343-1743 \nFax: 202-343-4011 \nfoia@hq.dhs.gov \nVisit our FOIA website",

We are filing similar requests for information with many other Michigan water utilities in collaboration with residents, community leaders, and local officials to better support the needs of low-income customers. If any of this information is publicly available and accessible, please send a link to the webpage where it is located. Please reply to this request via email. If you have any question or concern about this request, please call Cass Charrette at 248-980-1191.\r\n\r\nWhen possible, please provide the requested quantitative data in an Excel spreadsheet or other native digital format (such as CSV files). \r\n\r\n1. A copy of any data and documents that list the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service terminated starting January 1, 2019 to date of the submission of the FOIA, the reason for the termination, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this data is produced in another format, such as written logs or summary reports, please provide a copy of that instead. If your agency has a policy that home address information is exempt from FOIA, please provide this data at the street level. \r\n\r\n2. Any documents describing and listing the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service restored starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, following a disconnection. If this data is included in the same data set as Item 6, you may provide that full data set in lieu of processing this element separately.\r\n\r\n3. A copy of any existing, regularly generated reports that include the total amount of water and wastewater customer arrearages, number of customers in arrears, and median amount of arrearages per customer, and number of customers subject to potential service disconnection due to arrears by customer class (e.g., residential, non-profit, commercial, industrial) starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA. \r\n\r\n4. A copy of a list of referrals the utility/water system/municipality sent to the tax assessor to place a tax lien on properties due to non-payment of any water or sewer bill, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this information is stored in a summary database, you may provide that database.\r\n\r\n5. Any documents describing or listing the addresses of residential customer accounts that have been enrolled in and have been discharged from the Great Lakes Water Authority\u2019s Water Residential Assistance Program, and the reason for such removal or discharge, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA. \r\n\r\nAs I am requesting these records as a representative of People\u2019s Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization, and am doing so in the public interest, I request a waiver of fees. The analysis and release of these materials will contribute significantly to public understanding of water affordability issues in the tri-county area. \r\n\r\nI will expect a response within 5 business days as provided by law. If my request is denied in whole or in part, I expect a detailed justification for withholding the records. I also request any segregable portions that are not exempt to be disclosed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for reducing the burden of my request, please reach out and we are happy to discuss.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPeople\u2019s Water Board Coalition",

Dear Beth Hundsdorfer, The Madison County, IL received a public information request from you on January 18, 2023. Your request mentioned: \u201cAll reports, video recordings, audio records, lab results, evidence looks, search warrant applications and returns, 911 calls and CAD reports and any other documents possessed by your agency related to the murder of Randy Gori on Jan . 4, 2020. \nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\u201d The amount of information requested is \"unduly burdensome\" for the public body. Before declining to comply with a request as unduly burdensome, the public body must extend to the requester an opportunity to reduce the request to manageable proportions. If a public body determines that the burden on the public body outweighs the public interest in obtaining the information, and that there is no way to narrow the request, it must notify the requester in writing, specifying the reasons why it would be unduly burdensome and the extent to which compliance would so burden the operations of the public body. Such a response is treated as a denial of the FOIA request. See 5 ILCS 140/3(g).\u00a0\u00a0As such the Madison County Sheriff's Office is attempting to determine the extent and information that is present in the case and being\u00a0requested.\u00a0 Under\u00a0section 3(e) of FOIA provides that the period for response may be extended by the public body The time for response may be extended if: (ii) the request requires the collection of a substantial number of specified records; The Madison County, IL has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request.\u00a0 Your request is granted in part and denied in part.\u00a0 These files were found to be redacted and released with the following exemptions: 7(1)(a) \u2013 In that the request relates to records prohibited from release by Federal or State law (i.e. Juvenile Arrest Records) 7(1)(b) \u2013 Private Information such as SSN, Phone Number(s), Addresses, DL numbers are protected from release 7(1)(c) \u2013 Releasing the records constitutes an unreasonable Invasion of Personal Privacy of those involved. DOB\u2019s and family matters in which personal privacy outweighs the public interest are exempt. \"personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\u00a0 Section 7(1)(c) defines an \"[u]nwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" as \"the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.\" 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) (West 2018) In determining whether or not the disclosure of personal information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the public\u2019s interest in disclosure must be balanced against the degree of invasion of privacy. FOIA contemplates a case-by-case analysis that is necessarily based upon the specific facts underlying a request for disclosure. A few examples of the types of information that have been approved by the Public Access Counselor for redaction under 7(1) (c) include: dates of birth; names and identifying information of victims in police reports; and graphic photos of the deceased\u2019s body in an autopsy report. FOIA exempts from disclosure personal information\u00a0contained in public records if disclosing that information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u00a0for the person or persons to whom the information pertains. \"Personal information\" has been defined by the courts as information \"that is private and confidential.\"\u00a0Chicago Tribune v.

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all non-exempt, classified individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, title, department or agency, full-time/part-time status, work zip code, original hire date, civil service status, and gross annual salary (i.e., the base hourly wage for each hourly employee and the base annual salary for salaried employees for each of the time periods in question). If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",
