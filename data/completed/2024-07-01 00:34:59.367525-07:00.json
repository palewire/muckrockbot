The case is still in our complex backlog queue, pending assignment to a first level review.  Please be advised that each case must go through two levels of review before a release determination can be made.  Given the volume of our backlog and the fluctuation of queue placement due to consults from other agencies that predate your request, it's likely that your case may not be assigned to a first level review within the next 12 months.  At this time, the estimated completion date is approximately 3-4 years.  \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your patience thus far.\nRegards,\r\nCindy B \r\nNSA/CSS FOIA Requester Service Center\r\n(301)688-6527",

Our complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 181 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 232 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 659 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 998 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nHolly Early\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS)\r\nFBI-Records Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nPIO Line: (540) 868-4593\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4854\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391 or (450)868-4997\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

The FBI has located approximately 1,782 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-100 page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing.  Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nWe contact requesters with requests of this size to see if there might be a way to possibly narrow the scope.  Is this something you might be willing to consider?  If so, please contact me and we can discuss this possibility.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\nLeslie Wilson\r\n540-868-4894\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nNegotiation/RIDS/RMD\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation",

If you do want this request to be processed from the medium track queue with current estimated time for processing at about 7 months, the first two sections can be processed in whole and the 3rd section partial processing up to the 949 threshold for page count.  For this reduced scope, upon completion of all materials (an interim CD release should be received in about 3 to 4 months), you can place another FOIA request, citing this one, and ask for additional materials to be processed from this case.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you are interested in this.

The question of whether such files can be released has already been decided by your office. This should not require the agency to create a new record. This type of file format is how the logo must have been initially created by or for the government. An appeal decision in a previous FOIA case for the NROL-39 logo concluded that these records are in the public domain and must be released. The appeal case number with the National Reconnaissance Office was F-2019-00113. You can read the decision at https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/nrol-39-mission-logo-78740/#file-817847\r\n\r\nI am requesting the release for all missions listed on the following wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NRO_launches  If you need any clarification or further enumeration, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Welsh",

Request that all files be released a vector file format like a high quality PDF, an SVG or EPS.\"\r\n\r\nWe have assigned tracking number F-2023-00005 to your request. We will limit our search to NRO-originated records.\r\n\r\nSince we may be unable to provide a response within the 20 working days stipulated by the Act, you have the right to consider this a denial and may appeal on this basis to the NRO Appellate Authority, 14675 Lee Road, Chantilly, VA 20151-1715 after the initial 20 working day period has elapsed; doing so, however, would exhaust your administrative appeal rights. To preserve these rights, we recommend that you allow us sufficient time to continue processing your request and respond as soon as we can.  You will then have the right to appeal any denial of information after you receive a final response from us.  Unless we hear otherwise from you, we will assume that you agree and will continue processing your FOIA requests on this basis.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA authorizes federal agencies to assess fees for record services. Based on the information provided, you have been placed in the \"other\" category of requesters.  Requesters in this category are responsible for the cost of search time exceeding two hours ($48.00/hour) and duplication fees ($.15 per page) exceeding 100 pages. Additional information about fees can be found in the Department of Defense Fees section of the electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-cfr) at https://ecfr.io/title-32/se232.2.286.112.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email FOIA@NRO.mil <mailto:FOIA@NRO.mil>  or call the Requester Service Center at 703-745-0600.\r\n\r\n \r\nV/r, \r\n\r\nNational Reconnaissance Office\r\nInformation Review and Release Group\n",

        "communication": "Good Morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning file number 72-HQ-2190.  The FBI located approximately 1,374 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size.\r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  The current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 57 months.\r\n\r\nGiven the current COVID-19 pandemic and federal guidelines to mitigate the spread of the virus, the FBI's Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) is operating with limited staff on a staggered schedule to protect the safety of its employees, families and communities.  As a result, estimated dates of completion for Freedom of Information Act requests were impacted and you can expect lengthened response timelines.  Please note that these are estimates, and these timelines may change as this national emergency evolves.  The FBI remains committed to fulfilling your FOIPA request in the timeliest manner possible.   Thank you for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of all tracks and the average time approximately to complete each.  Hopefully this breakdown will be helpful to you in reducing the scope of this request.\r\nSimple track request (0- 50 pages) current average time is approximately 4 months to complete.\r\nMedium track request (51-950 pages) current average time is approximately 27 months to complete.\r\nLarge track request (951-8000 pages) current average time is approximately 57 months to complete.\r\nX-Large track request (over 8000 pages) current average time is approximately 70 months to complete.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>.

As of October 1, 2023, we have 373 open requests and over 1,407,542 pages of records waiting to be reviewed, analyzed, redacted, and released. As such, our office must balance the competing needs of many requesters. Some request small numbers of records that are easy to review and analyze. Others request large numbers of records or records that are complex and require a longer time to review.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of fairness, we make every effort to respond to requests in the order received. Therefore, we will proceed in processing your requests in the same manner, responding to the oldest before moving on to your next subsequent request. However as a one-time exception, if you would like to re-prioritize your requests, please email our office by October 20, 2023. If we do not hear from you by that date, our office will continue processing your requests in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact our office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan Adams\r\nCompliance Analyst\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON\r\nOffice of Public Records and Open Public Meetings\r\nMail: Roosevelt Commons-Box 354997, Seattle, WA 98195\r\nStreet: 4311 11th Ave NE, #360\n",

It is a straightforward request, and I've made an effort to craft it in such a way that minimizes the University's burden in responding, by explicitly excluding records likely to require third party notification efforts.  I'm requesting information that the University has already specifically identified on the CoMotion FAQ, which should not take two calendar years to locate.\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKevin Wallace",

These costs are allowed by RCW 42.56.070(7)(a).\r\n\r\nPlease remit payment by check or money order, or call to make an appointment to view these records, by 06/03/2024.

The costs for obtaining records via the portal are on our website.  If we do not receive payment or a call for an appointment by 06/03/2024, we will close your request.\r\n\r\nYou may reach us by email at pubrec@uw.edu or you may call us at 206.543.9180.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTisa Escobar\r\nUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON\r\nOffice of Public Records and Open Public Meetings\r\nMail: Roosevelt Commons-Box 354997, Seattle, WA 98195\r\nStreet: 4311 11th Ave NE, #360\n",

Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 134 days from the date of receipt for processing.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If you still feel you are unable to complete this Request, please request an Attorney General Opinion as required by law. Below is the statue for reference along with the requirements for withholding information.\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n-B\r\n\r\nA. \r\nDuties of the Governmental Body and of the Attorney General Under \r\nSubchapter G \r\nSections 552.301, 552.302, and 552.303 of the Government Code set out the duty of a \r\ngovernmental body to seek the attorney general\u2019s decision on whether information is excepted \r\nfrom disclosure to the public. \r\nSection 552.301, subsections (a) and (b), provides that when a governmental body receives a \r\nwritten request for information the governmental body wishes to withhold, it must seek an attorney \r\ngeneral decision within ten business days of its receipt of the request and state the exceptions to \r\ndisclosure that it believes are applicable.  Subsections (a) and (b) read: \r\n(a) A governmental body that receives a written request for information that it wishes \r\nto withhold from public disclosure and that it considers to be within one of the \r\nexceptions under Subchapter C must ask for a decision from the attorney general \r\nabout whether the information is within that exception if there has not been a \r\nprevious determination about whether the information falls within one of the \r\nexceptions. \r\n. . . \r\n(b) The governmental body must ask for the attorney general\u2019s decision and state the \r\nexceptions that apply within a reasonable time but not later than the 10th business \r\nday after the date of receiving the written request. \r\nThus, a governmental body that wishes to withhold information from the public on the ground of \r\nan exception generally must seek the decision of the attorney general as to the applicability of that \r\nexception.144  In addition, an entity contending that it is not subject to the Act may timely request \r\na decision from the attorney general to avoid the consequences of noncompliance if the entity is \r\ndetermined to be subject to the Act.145  Therefore, when requesting such a decision, the entity \r\n\r\nshould not only present its arguments as to why it is not subject to the Act, but should also raise \r\nany exceptions to required disclosure it believes apply to the requested information. \r\nA governmental body need not request an attorney general decision if there has been a previous \r\ndetermination that the requested material falls within one of the exceptions to disclosure.146  What \r\nconstitutes a \u201cprevious determination\u201d is narrow in scope, and governmental bodies are cautioned \r\nagainst treating most published attorney general decisions as \u201cprevious determinations\u201d to avoid \r\nthe requirements of section 552.301(a).  The attorney general has determined that there are two \r\ntypes of previous determinations.147  The first and by far the most common instance of a previous \r\ndetermination pertains to specific information that is again requested from a governmental body \r\nwhen the attorney general has previously issued a decision that evaluates the public availability of \r\nthe precise information or records at issue.  This first instance of a previous determination does \r\nnot apply to records that are substantially similar to records previously submitted to the attorney \r\ngeneral for review, nor does it apply to information that may fall within the same category as any \r\ngiven records on which the attorney general has previously ruled.  The first type of previous \r\ndetermination requires that all of the following criteria be met: \r\n1. the information at issue is precisely the same information that was previously submitted to \r\nthe attorney general pursuant to section 552.301(e)(1)(D) of the Government Code; \r\n2. the governmental body that received the request for the information is the same \r\ngovernmental body that previously requested and received a ruling from the attorney \r\ngeneral; \r\n3. the attorney general\u2019s prior ruling concluded the precise information is or is not excepted \r\nfrom disclosure under the Act; and \r\n4. the law, facts, and circumstances on which the prior attorney general ruling was based have \r\nnot changed since the issuance of the ruling.148 \r\nAbsent all four of the above criteria, and unless the second type of previous determination applies, \r\na governmental body must ask for a decision from the attorney general if it wishes to withhold \r\nfrom the public information that is requested under the Act. \r\nThe second type of previous determination requires that all of the following criteria be met: \r\n1. the information at issue falls within a specific, clearly delineated category of information \r\nabout which the attorney general has previously rendered a decision;\r\n2. the previous decision is applicable to the particular governmental body or type of \r\ngovernmental body from which the information is requested;149 \r\n3. the previous decision concludes the specific, clearly delineated category of information is \r\nor is not excepted from disclosure under the Act; \r\n4. the elements of law, fact, and circumstances are met to support the previous decision\u2019s \r\nconclusion that the requested records or information at issue is or is not excepted from \r\nrequired disclosure; and150 \r\n5. the previous decision explicitly provides that the governmental body or bodies to which \r\nthe decision applies may withhold the information without the necessity of again seeking \r\na decision from the attorney general. \r\nAbsent all five of the above criteria, and unless the first type of previous determination applies, a \r\ngovernmental body must ask for a decision from the attorney general if it wishes to withhold \r\nrequested information from the public under the Act.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n(b)  Information in appraisal records under Section 25.02 is confidential and is available only for the official use of the appraisal district, this state, the comptroller, and taxing units and political subdivisions of this state if:\r\n(1)  the information identifies the home address of a named individual to whom this section applies; and\r\n(2)  the individual:\r\n\r\n(A)  chooses to restrict public access to the information on the form prescribed for that purpose by the comptroller under Section 5.07; or\r\n\r\n(B)  is a federal or state judge, or the spouse of a federal or state judge, beginning on the date the Office of Court Administration of the Texas Judicial System notifies the appraisal district of the judge's qualification for the judge's office.\r\n(c)  A choice made under Subsection (b) remains valid until rescinded in writing by the individual.\r\n(d)  This section does not prohibit the public disclosure of information in appraisal records that identifies property according to an address if the information does not identify an individual who has made an election under Subsection (b) in connection with the individual's address.\r\n",

ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nA search of the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) for records responsive to your request produced 1 page that is responsive to your request.  ICE has determined that 1 page will be released in their entirety; ICE has claimed no deletions or exemptions. All PREA audit reports are posted to the public ICE FOIA Library. Please review these reports at www.ice.gov/foia/library. \n\nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA Office \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nFreedom of Information Act Office \n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009 \n\nEnclosure(s):\t 1 page(s)",

        "communication": "Dear Julieta Cardenas:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA), Office of Information Affairs, FOIA Division (OIA-FOIA). Your request was received by this office on May 23, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe OIA-FOIA is under the purview of the General Counsel (GC) and serves as the focal point for USDA\u2019s FOIA program. It provides coordination and ensures agency-wide compliance with the FOIA. Additionally, the OIA-FOIA processes requests and appeals on behalf of the Office of the Secretary (OSEC); the Under Secretaries; USDA\u2019s staff offices; and the Research, Education and Economics and Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs mission areas.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires USDA to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the Federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous records that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches with components and possible consultations with components that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, USDA will invoke a 10 business day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Pursuant to USDA FOIA Regulations, Title 7 CFR \u00a71.6(a), the USDA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow USDA to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you were categorized as a \u201cnews media\u201d requester, pursuant to 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section (2)(b)(5)(i). For your review and information, a copy of the USDA FOIA Fee Schedule is attached. In accordance with 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section 3(b), your fees shall be waived where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less.\r\n\r\nOnce we initiate processing, a search will be conducted for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA analyst will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned FOIA Case Number, 2024-OSEC-04821-F. Please refer to this case number in any future correspondence. If you have any questions regarding the processing of this request, please contact Olga Colacicco by email at olga.colacicco@usda.gov<mailto:olga.colacicco@usda.gov> or USDAFOIA@usda.gov<mailto:USDAFOIA@usda.gov%20>. For additional information regarding USDA FOIA regulations and process, please refer to the information available on-line at Freedom of Information Act Division | USDA<https://www.usda.gov/ogc/office-information-affairs/foia-division>.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information generated by the USDA solely for the intended recipients. Any unauthorized interception of this message or the use or disclosure of the information it contains may violate the law and subject the violator to civil or criminal penalties.

Balagula is also a known associate of the Five Families of La Cosa Nostra (LCN), as well as a bootlegger of gasoline.  \r\n\r\nBalagula was reported dead December 2019 by the British Broadcasting Corporation World Service/BBC News Russian. The original obituary in Russian is attached, as well as the Google Translate machine translation to English. This shall serve as proof that Balagula is deceased and that privacy concerns under FOIA and Privacy Act are diminished.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Counterdrug Information Indices System (CIIS),  Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies.\r\n\r\nTo assist in the search and identification of records, the following biographical information about Balagula are known:\r\n\r\nDOB: September 8, 1943\r\nPOB: Orenburg, Russia (as part of the former Soviet Union) \r\nFirst five digits of SSN: 062-60 \r\nU.S. Bureau of Prisons register number: 35664-066\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the U.S. Secret Service, which investigated Balagula's activities as a credit card counterfeiter, furnished the following identifiers and employers in response to a request for its records. They may be of use in a search:\r\n\r\nFBI #: 226822EA3\r\nPassport #: E1929203 US\r\nAutomated Fingerprint Identification System #: 26306\r\nIdentification Dates (photo, fingerprint, palmprint): 12/27/1985\r\nLicense plate at time of arrest: New York # 8672TAY\r\nEmployer 1: Sadko Restaurant\r\nEmployer 2: Energy Makers of America\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The grounds for appeal are as follows:\r\n\r\n(b)(1): All records returned are older than the 25 years. Related redactions should be reconsidered in light of automatic declassification policies per Executive Order 13526.  \r\n\r\n(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C): By context, I believe names of persons that have been redacted for reasons of privacy are in fact known to be deceased. Such deceased persons have diminished privacy interests, which are outweighed by the public interest in disclosure.  \r\n\r\nMy prayer for relief is for the request to be remanded with instructions for the following:\r\n\r\n1) To review classified records with the presumption that records older than 25 years are declassified by default. \r\n\r\n2) To review the records, cross referencing names against the RIDS Dead List; where an individual named is in fact known to be deceased, redaction should be removed. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nT.

If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

CORA Reimbursement Policy\u00a0\u2010 \r\nThe Colorado Open Records Act allows for the following reimbursement for reasonable costs\r\nassociated with completing a request: \r\n \r\n  * Copying Expenses: We charge $0.25 for each hard\u2010copy page after the first 25 pages. \r\n  * Staff Time: For requests that require more than one hour of staff time, we charge $33.58 for\r\n    each additional hour of staff time expended. \r\n  * There will be a retrieval charge for documents stored at an offsite facility, dependent on the\r\n    number of boxes to be retrieved. \r\n  * Electronically stored files which are larger than 14MB will be transferred to a CD for a charge of\r\n    $10 per CD. \r\nYou can read more about the District\u2019s CORA Policy \r\n You will receive an email when your request has been completed.",

Please log in to the CORA Request Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records. We found the check. CORA Records Request - R000453-060324  NOTE: Denver Public Schools uses the Facebook moderator to block certain keywords. Keywords that might be inappropriate\u00a0or discriminatory for example. All hidden comments are reviewed\u00a0by the DPS social media team\u00a0and often unhidden because the Facebook Moderator might have blocked it for an odd reason. A key example of this is a comment that says, \"Happy Pride Month!\" This comment was blocked because it has an exclamation point then unblocked by a human on the DPS social media team. Again, all hidden comments are reviewed\u00a0by a DPS employee. \r\nAn oversight of the words that are blocked on the Facebook Moderator is the exclamation sign. Therefore any post that has \"!\" would have been hidden by the Facebook Moderator, then unhidden by the DPS social media team. This has since been changed. \r\nAlso of note, comments blocked by the\u00a0Facebook\u00a0Moderator, then unhidden by a DPS employee, did not show up on this report. \r\nDPS operates with a social media policy that does not allow for bullying, use of slurs, use of profanity, or words and comments that violate our values. \r\nSincerely, STACY WHEELER \r\nCORA Officer",

Your request is made pursuant to the provisions of the Nebraska Public Records Act. In your request dated April 29, 2024 you sought information related to date of stop, time of stop, race of driver, gender of driver, age of driver, if search occurred, if contraband was found, anonymized officer ID, and stop location for all years available. This is the response required by NEB. REV. STAT. \u00a7 84-712, et seq. The Nebraska public records statute allows persons the right to examine public records in the possession of public agencies during normal agency business hours, to make memorandum and abstracts from those public records, and to obtain copies of public records in certain circumstances. The statute does not require a public agency to review documents and create abstracts or other lists, to answer questions, or to create documents that do not otherwise exist. See NEB.REV.STAT. \u00a7 84-712. Although the Nebraska public records statutes provided for access to public documents, such access is not absolute. The statutes also provide for exceptions to disclosures by express and special provisions; there are 21 categories of documents that may be kept confidential from the public at the discretion of the agency involved. See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 84-712.05. I have attached the available data we were able to pull from our database to the portal attachment tab for your refereence. There are random blanks for race, gender, and location in the data. All fields are supposed to be filled out, however, based on my experience with drop down boxes on our cruiser computers, the occassional clerical error can occur as the information doesn't always populate from the drop down menu. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this. Section 84-712.03 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes may grant you the right to administrative or judicial review of this response. Please consult the statute for further information. Chief of Police Todd Schmaderer is responsible for denying a portion of your request. Thank you for your patience in my response to this request. If you have any questions about the legal basis for this response, please contact me at 402.444.5259.",

Records that show all CPS incidents that included a student referral to law enforcement, including school-based resource officers, the underlying offense, the result of each referral, such as arrest or ticket/citation for municipal ordinance violation, and the gender, race, disability status and ELL status of the students who were referred for the 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and the 2023-2024 school years. Please also include the school in the data breakdown. The records could include, but not be limited to, disciplinary logs or reports, incident logs or reports, behavior resolution reports, and data that reflects the referrals, arrests and citations during the above years. \r\n2. The number of arrests of students on CPS property from July 1, 2021 to current broken down by CPS property name and address. Please break this data down by age of arrestee. RESPONSE : A portion of the information you seek can be found online. Please visit the CPS data website which includes police notification information: https://www.cps.edu/about/district-data/metrics/ . Scroll to the bottom of the page and download the spreadsheets beside the \u201cSuspensions and Expulsions\u201d header. \r\nBe advised that you may wish to submit a FOIA request to the Chicago Police Department (CPD) for \u201carrests of students\u201d information at the following website: https://home.chicagopolice.org/inside-cpd/freedom-of-information-act-foia/ . \r\nPursuant to 5 ILCS 140/8.5: Records maintained online. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, to the contrary, a public body is not required to copy a public record that is published on the public body\u2019s website. The public body shall notify the requester that the public record is available online and direct the requester to the website where the record can be reasonably accessed. \r\nAs to the remainder of your request, be advised that the CPS FOIA office has determined that it does not properly identify a document(s) for search and would require a CPS FOIA Officer to conduct research and create a new record. To search for the information you seek in the manner requested, a FOIA Officer would need to go to various departments, research, create a list of possible responsive records, and answer questions, which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. \r\nUnder the Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. \r\nFurther, section 1 of FOIA states in part: \u201cThis Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\u201d In accordance with Section 1 of the Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer your questions or prepare researched records on your behalf in response to your request. In the case of a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Ana Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. PDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
