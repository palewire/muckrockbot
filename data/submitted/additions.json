Your request lacks specificity (specific names). Your request lacks a keyword for a search. There are over 21,000 employees at the University of Wisconsin Madison and on any given day many may email a business for a variety of reasons. If you are seeking records you will know the subject for a keyword search. The law does not allow us to guess at what record(s) you are looking for. If I have not heard back from you by 2.15.24 your request will be closed as abandoned. You may always make a new request. \r\nJulie Laundrie Public Records Custodian Office of Compliance University of Wisconsin-Madison   \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Access the Public Records Center to View the Request",
