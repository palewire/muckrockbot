Specifically, I request this information as a data set or spreadsheet that includes the following information (if available):\r\n\r\nCase Number\r\nName of Deceased\r\nAge of Deceased\r\nBirthdate of Deceased\r\nGender\r\nRace\r\nEthnicity (please note if Hispanic/Latino)\r\nDate of Death\r\nManner of Death\r\nPrimary Cause(s)\r\nSecondary Cause(s)\r\nIncident Address or Place of Death (including city and zip code)\r\nResidence Address (including city and zip code)\r\nPronouncement Address (including hospital name if applicable)\r\nNotifying Agency\r\nAutopsy (if applicable)\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $20. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of coronavirus cases in Orleans Parish. I am a journalist at the Guardian, which is a public interest news organization, and this information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nSection 44:32(D) of the Louisiana Public Records Act requires a response within three business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than that time period, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records. I can be reached at any time at 646-726-1894 or oliver.laughland@theguardian.com.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. If only partial information is available, please release only the partial information to me.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOliver Laughland",
