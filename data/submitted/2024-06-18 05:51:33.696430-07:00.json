I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to Ms. Victoria Lynn Morgan, aka Vicki Morgan, aka Vicky Morgan, aka Vickie Morgan (August 9, 1952 \u2013 July 7, 1983). \r\n\r\nMs. Morgan's name appears multiples times in the Bureau file of magazine publisher Larry Flynt (HQ 62-15369). Instances include:\r\n\r\n1. A Bureau memo dated March 9, 1984, which states that an associate of Mr. Flynt voluntarily appeared before the U.S. Attorney General in Washington D.C. to furnish information about Mr. Flynt. This individual claimed Mr. Flynt was passing around a video tape he purported to be of Ms. Morgan engaged in acts of a sexual nature with government officials. Subsequently, this individual gave a cassette tape to two special agents that contained conversations between another Flynt associate, Gordon Novel, and an unnamed party, in which Mr. Novel alleged that Mr. Flynt was attempting to sell the video tape to the KGB.\r\n\r\n2. Two pages from Mr. Flynt's short-lived newsweekly, The Rebel, which reference Ms. Morgan.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Ms. Morgan was the mistress of businessman Alfred Bloomingdale. According to a May 21, 1984 Time magazine article: \"TIME has learned that Bloomingdale had been investigated by the FBI as early as the late 1960s, when his name came up in connection with organized-crime figures in Las Vegas. About 15 years ago, Bloomingdale shelled out $5,000 in blackmail because of his habit of beating up prostitutes. Yet despite that record, he was chosen by Reagan as an appointee to the sensitive Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board in 1981.\"\r\n\r\nConfirmation of this passage can be found here: https://time.com/archive/6860378/a-mistresss-life-and-death/\r\n\r\nIn addition to the reference to a Bureau investigation in the late 1960s, Mr. Bloomingdale, as mentioned, was an unelected political appointee to the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (FSAB). All individuals who served on the FSAB were required to undergo a security background check, conducted by the Bureau, for a top-secret security clearance. This would have required the Bureau to open a file on the individual, if one did not already exist, and generate records in the course of that investigation. It is likely the Bureau would have identified Ms. Morgan and her relationship to Mr. Bloomingdale during this process.\r\n\r\nFinally,  Ms. Morgan was murdered by an associate, Marvin Pancoast, on July 7, 1983. After her murder, attorneys for Mr. Pancoast subpoenaed the Bureau for all records on Ms. Morgan. \r\n\r\nConfirmation of the above statement can be found here: https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/05/08/Attorneys-for-the-accused-killer-of-Vicki-Morgan-the/3755452836800/\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am requesting all FBI records for Victoria Lynn Morgan, to include all instances mentioned above, those not mentioned, and any records that may have been generated after her death.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Ms. Morgan's privacy, as she passed away in 1983. Although her death was a matter of public record and reported widely in the media, you can find a Washington Post obituary, dated July 7, 1983, here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1983/07/08/vicki-morgan-slain-bloomingdale-mistress-bludgeoned-to-death/a18bb1a6-c14c-4554-a20e-48cbfd8425ac/\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Failure to comply with the Texas Public Information Act, including improperly withholding or redacting information without proper justification, may result in litigation, including but not limited to an Article 78 proceeding to compel compliance.\r\n\r\nSubject: Texas Public Information Act Request \u2013 Investigations and Surveillance of Black Lives Matter\r\n\r\nDear Public Information Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Texas Public Information Act (Chapter 552 of the Government Code), I am writing to request access to specific records held by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) related to the investigation and surveillance of the organization known as Black Lives Matter (BLM) and its local chapters (e.g., BLM Houston, BLM Dallas, BLM Austin) from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2021.\r\n\r\nRequested Information:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tInvestigation Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tDates and brief descriptions of the last three instances where BLM or its local chapters were investigated or surveilled by the DPS.\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of investigation reports, including initial reports, progress reports, and final reports.\r\n\t2.\tContextual Documents:\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal memos, emails, and other communications (including attachments) related to the initiation, conduct, and conclusion of the investigations.\r\n\t\u2022\tDocuments detailing the purpose of the investigations, the methodologies used, and the findings of each investigation.\r\n\t\u2022\tMeeting notes or summaries from any internal meetings where these investigations were discussed.\r\n\t3.\tPublic Safety Assessments:\r\n\t\u2022\tAssessments or analyses discussing the public safety implications of these investigations.\r\n\t\u2022\tRisk assessments or threat evaluations that were conducted as part of or in conjunction with these investigations.\r\n\t4.\tPolicies and Procedures:\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to the surveillance or investigation of BLM or related groups.\r\n\t\u2022\tTraining materials or manuals used by DPS personnel in conducting such investigations.\r\n\t5.\tInteragency Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tCorrespondence between DPS and other law enforcement agencies (local, state, or federal) regarding the investigation or surveillance of BLM.\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords of any interagency meetings or collaborations related to these investigations.\r\n\t6.\tElectronic Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tEmails, text messages, and other forms of electronic communication from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2021, that include any of the following keywords: \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d \u201cBLM,\u201d \u201cBLM Houston,\u201d \u201cBLM Dallas,\u201d \u201cBLM Austin,\u201d \u201cprotest,\u201d \u201cdemonstration,\u201d \u201crally,\u201d \u201cactivist,\u201d \u201csurveillance,\u201d \u201cinvestigation.\u201d\r\n\t7.\tPrevious Request Communications:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll records of email communications, internal memos, notes, and any other correspondence related to my previous Texas Public Information Act request (PIR# 23-1052, Tracking #2023-24018), which sought documents related to the surveillance or investigation of Black Lives Matter and related groups. This includes any communications between the DPS and other entities concerning the processing, handling, or response to this request.\r\n\r\nAddressing Common Exceptions:\r\nI am aware that DPS has previously cited sections 552.101 and 552.108 of the Government Code, as well as section 418.177 of the Texas Homeland Security Act (HSA), as grounds for withholding information. However, these exceptions do not universally apply to the requested information:\r\n\r\n\t\u2022\tSection 552.101 and 418.177: Section 418.177 pertains specifically to information related to the prevention, detection, or investigation of terrorism or related criminal activity. General law enforcement investigations that do not directly pertain to terrorism do not fall under this provision. The case Texas Department of Public Safety v. Cox Texas Newspapers, LP, 304 S.W.3d 191 (Tex. App. \u2013 Austin 2009), clarified that the public\u2019s right to transparency outweighs broad claims of confidentiality under general security concerns.\r\n\t\u2022\tSection 552.108: This section is intended to protect information related to ongoing law enforcement proceedings or internal records used for law enforcement purposes. In City of Dallas v. Abbott, 304 S.W.3d 380 (Tex. 2010), it was clarified that unless the release of information would interfere with law enforcement or prosecution, the information should be disclosed. Additionally, the peaceful nature of BLM activities typically does not warrant withholding information under this provision.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as established in Dallas Morning News v. City of Dallas, 281 S.W.3d 708 (Tex. App. \u2013 Dallas 2009), a government entity cannot withhold requested information unless it can demonstrate that the information falls within a specific exception under the Texas Public Information Act. Any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records or documents must be accompanied by a specific and detailed justification for each exemption relied upon.\r\n\r\nIf any part of the requested information is considered exempt, I request a written explanation specifying the legal grounds for each redaction or withholding, including references to the specific statutory provisions that justify the exemption.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nIn accordance with the Texas Public Information Act, I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request. The disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest as it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities and is not primarily in my commercial interest.\r\n\r\nThis request is for the sake of public transparency and is not for commercial purposes. Should there be any fees associated with this request, despite the waiver request, please inform me of the total charges in advance. I would prefer the request to be fulfilled electronically via email, but I am also open to receiving the information in other formats if necessary.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response within the 10 business days required by statute.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

However, these exceptions do not universally apply to the requested information:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Section 552.101 and 418.177: Section 418.177 pertains specifically to information related to the prevention, detection, or investigation of terrorism or related criminal activity. General law enforcement investigations that do not directly pertain to terrorism do not fall under this provision. The case Texas Department of Public Safety v. Cox Texas Newspapers, LP, 304 S.W.3d 191 (Tex. App. \u2013 Austin 2009), clarified that the public\u2019s right to transparency outweighs broad claims of confidentiality under general security concerns.\r\n\u2022 Section 552.108: This section is intended to protect information related to ongoing law enforcement proceedings or internal records used for law enforcement purposes. In City of Dallas v. Abbott, 304 S.W.3d 380 (Tex. 2010), it was clarified that unless the release of information would interfere with law enforcement or prosecution, the information should be disclosed. Additionally, the peaceful nature of BLM activities typically does not warrant withholding information under this provision.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as established in Dallas Morning News v. City of Dallas, 281 S.W.3d 708 (Tex. App. \u2013 Dallas 2009), a government entity cannot withhold requested information unless it can demonstrate that the information falls within a specific exception under the Texas Public Information Act. Any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records or documents must be accompanied by a specific and detailed justification for each exemption relied upon.\r\n\r\nIf any part of the requested information is considered exempt, I request a written explanation specifying the legal grounds for each redaction or withholding, including references to the specific statutory provisions that justify the exemption.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nIn accordance with the Texas Public Information Act, I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request. The disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest as it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities and is not primarily in my commercial interest.\r\n\r\nThis request is for the sake of public transparency and is not for commercial purposes. Should there be any fees associated with this request, despite the waiver request, please inform me of the total charges in advance. I would prefer the request to be fulfilled electronically via email, but I am also open to receiving the information in other formats if necessary.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response within the 10 business days required by statute.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/TheJ/138471/Fee_Waiver_Letter_copy.pdf\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Ftexas-department-public-safety-621%252Finvestigations-and-surveillance-of-black-lives-matter-165179%252F%253Femail%253DOGC.Webmaster%252540dps.texas.gov&url_auth_token=AAAeESOFbhsaWRZJHm-neP00CEU%3A1sJ2BW%3AfKJnV8m84TeftOhswED1USGvC45K9fELakfNUOVM07Y \r\nYour request will be forwarded to the relevant division(s) to locate the requested information and to determine any costs associated with producing the requested records.
