If we do not receive clarification on what types of identifiable records you are requesting within thirty (30) days by Friday, June 14, we will close the request.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned Public Records Request Number PDR_212 Terse\r\n\r\nWe are in the process of gathering, identifying, and reviewing records responsive to your request, and the records request is currently being processed by the Administrative Services department.

My request specifically states \"All emails, text messages, chat messages (Teams, Slack, etc), and/or call logs [...]\" in item 1 and \"Any notes, work logs, or other memoranda [...]\" in item 2 specifically regarding public records request PDR_181. While 42.56.080 classifies \"A request for all or substantially all records prepared, owned, used, or retained by an agency\" as an invalid request, the statute continues \"a request for all records regarding a particular topic or containing a particular keyword or name shall not be considered a request for all of an agency's records\". The topic is clearly discernable from my original request: records \"regarding the fulfillment of PDR_181\".\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you ask for a \"date range\". It would be reasonable to assume that the date range would begin on the date the request was filed (April 14) until the date this request was received, rather than threatening to close my request if no clarification is provided. This is common practice by other municipal agencies I have requested similar records from.\r\n\r\nAs you are familiar with the Washington Public Records Act, it is hard not to wonder whether these are attempts to unreasonably delay my request or otherwise deny me access to the requested records. I again respectfully ask that I be provided with the full breadth of the requested information without unreasonable delay.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRose",

We apologize for the delay in responding to your request. However, because of the increasing number of requests received by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), we found it necessary to adopt the ruling in the case of Open America v. Watergate Special Prosecution Force, 547 F.2d 605 (D.C. Cir. 1976) and exercise due diligence by following a first-in, first-out FOIA processing.\r\nIf you are still interested in receiving the documents, please respond to this email, and we will complete the processing of your request. If we have not received your response within 30 working days from the date of this email, we will assume you are no longer interested in receiving the documents and the case will be administratively closed.

Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Trump at the Schnecksville Fire Company fairgrounds:\r\n\r\n1. A roster of all employees of the department, including but not limited to first name, last name, badge number, salary, and date of hire.\r\n2. All emails, text messages, call logs, and/or other communications among members of the department and between the department and other local, state, federal and campaign entities regarding the rally. Please provide communications that occurred any time between January 1, 2024 and the date of this request.\r\n3. All invoices, memoranda of understanding or other such agreements showing and/or describing the services the department provided for the rally.\r\n4. All overtime requests submitted to the department for hours worked on 4/13/2024.\r\n5. Documents showing active shooter protocols for the department, including documents outlining any training department employees have taken in the past five years.\r\n\r\nPlease note, this request is not misdirected. I know the rally on 4/13/2024 occurred outside Whitehall Township police jurisdiction. However, photo and video from that day shows Whitehall Township police provided support.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDanielle Ohl",

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. Saving the step of transforming the CSV to PDF saves the City of Cortez time, saving the taxpayers of Cortez money. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

As I read it Section 3-4.2 of the manual describes the circumstances under which mutual aid can be requested / accepted, and the rules for doing so. \r\n\r\nBut my request sought a record reflecting the process described in this manual actually happening: \r\n\r\n\u201cA copy of any Memorandum of Understanding, Memorandum of Agreement, Mutual Aid Agreement, or other, similar document allowing the Atlanta Police Department to exercise police power outside the City of Atlanta's territorial jurisdiction in unincorporated Dekalb County.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo narrow a bit, let\u2019s focus on the property surrounding Key Road, Constitution, and Bouldercrest, where APD is currently exercising police power. Is there a memo of understanding for that exercise between DKPD and APD? If so, that\u2019s what I thought I was requesting. Happy to file a new request and close this one out if it\u2019s easier, but it also seems like a list of standing agreements reflecting the decisions laid out in 3-4.2 is a record DKPS would have that would be responsive to my original request. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance! \r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAndrew Free\r\n                ",

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nRose Terse \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Ftukwila-police-department-5736%252Ftalk2seattlegov-emails-164280%252F%253Femail%253Dpdrecords%252540tukwilawa.gov&url_auth_token=AABB8Pcwq_lGbpRlok39-nzQwLA%3A1sCVZb%3AquheTnwT6YumVsOf8YUxzQyC_T-93sTNZj4CBQjaEmQ\" \r\nThe department has reviewed your request and has determined that some or all of the records requested are exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act for the following reasons:06a Investigative, Law enforcement, crime victims RCW 42.56.240(1) Specific intelligence information and investigative records are exemption from disclosure. \r\n06b Identity of witnesses or victims of crimes RCW 42.56.240(2) Information revealing the identity of a witness or victim is exempt from disclosure \r\n07a Name of Juvenile Offender RCW 13.50.050(3) and (5); RCW 42.56.070(1) Name of juvenile contained in a records related to the commission of a juvenile offense is confidential and cannot be released \r\n07b Identifying Information of Juvenile Offender RCW 13.50.050(3) and (5); RCW 42.56.070(1) Identifying information of a juvenile contained in a record related to the commission of a juvenile offense is confidential and may not be released. \r\n08b Identifying Information of Juvenile RCW 13.50.100; RCW 42.56.070(1) Identifying information of a juvenile not related to the commission of a juvenile offense is confidential and exempt from disclosure. \r\n\r\nPlease note there are black boxes (redactions) on various pages of the responsive documents. The black box may be small or large, depending on the size of the redaction. There may be multiple redactions on a page. Within the redaction is a white code, which will look something along the lines of \u201cRedacted Text [1a].\u201d This code designates the statutory exemption being applied to the document. If there is only one code on the page, but there are numerous redactions, that one statutory exemption applies to all the redactions. \r\nProvided with these responsive documents is a key to the codes. This key identifies the statutory bases for the exemption as well as a brief explanation for why the exemption applies. As you review these responsive documents, you will be able to refer to the key below to identify the exemption and its application. \r\nYou should now be able to retrieve any responsive records via the Tukwila PD electronic Record Center. The records are best viewed on a desktop or laptop computer. The records may not be accessible from a mobile device. Review of the records for installments must be made within 30 days of notification of availability or the request can be closed. \r\nWe estimate the next installment to this request will be available on or before 9/20/2024. \u00a0If public records become available in advance of this estimate we will contact you promptly. \u00a0Conversely, if the department encounters a need to extend our time estimate, we will contact you promptly with a revised estimated date. \r\nRegards, \r\nRebecca \r\nTukwila Police Department \r\n206-433-1808",

Your request mentioned: \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nThe following metadata for all emails the Tukwila Police Department has received from \"@talk2.seattle.gov\" between January 1, 2023 and the date this request was processed: \r\n- Sender \r\n- Recipient (To, CC, BCC) \r\n- Date and time sent \r\n- Subject \r\n\r\nAs this is a request for metadata only, please do not include the email body in the returned records. I request that this data be provided in Excel or CSV format if possible. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nRose Terse \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Ftukwila-police-department-5736%252Ftalk2seattlegov-emails-164280%252F%253Femail%253Dpdrecords%252540tukwilawa.gov&url_auth_token=AABB8Pcwq_lGbpRlok39-nzQwLA%3A1sCVZb%3AquheTnwT6YumVsOf8YUxzQyC_T-93sTNZj4CBQjaEmQ\" \r\nThe department has reviewed your request and has determined that some or all of the records requested are exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act for the following reasons: \r\n06a Investigative, Law enforcement, crime victims RCW 42.56.240(1) Specific intelligence information and investigative records are exemption from disclosure. \r\n06b Identity of witnesses or victims of crimes RCW 42.56.240(2) Information revealing the identity of a witness or victim is exempt from disclosure \r\n07a Name of Juvenile Offender RCW 13.50.050(3) and (5); RCW 42.56.070(1) Name of juvenile contained in a records related to the commission of a juvenile offense is confidential and cannot be released \r\n07b Identifying Information of Juvenile Offender RCW 13.50.050(3) and (5); RCW 42.56.070(1) Identifying information of a juvenile contained in a record related to the commission of a juvenile offense is confidential and may not be released. \r\n08b Identifying Information of Juvenile RCW 13.50.100; RCW 42.56.070(1) Identifying information of a juvenile not related to the commission of a juvenile offense is confidential and exempt from disclosure. \r\n\r\nPlease note there are black boxes (redactions) on various pages of the responsive documents. The black box may be small or large, depending on the size of the redaction. There may be multiple redactions on a page. Within the redaction is a white code, which will look something along the lines of \u201cRedacted Text [1a].\u201d This code designates the statutory exemption being applied to the document. If there is only one code on the page, but there are numerous redactions, that one statutory exemption applies to all the redactions. \r\nProvided with these responsive documents is a key to the codes. This key identifies the statutory bases for the exemption as well as a brief explanation for why the exemption applies. As you review these responsive documents, you will be able to refer to the key below to identify the exemption and its application. \r\nYou should now be able to retrieve any responsive records via the Tukwila PD electronic Record Center. \r\nThe records are best viewed on a desktop or laptop computer. The records may not be accessible from a mobile device. The Police Department has provided you with a web link to all records that are responsive to your request.\u00a0 The Police Department now considers your request as closed, and, therefore does not intend to further address the request.\u00a0 Any actions to seek judicial review of the City\u2019s response to your request must be filed within one year of this notice in accordance with RCW 42.56.550. \r\nIf you believe that additional responsive records have not been provided or if have any questions, you may contact our office at (206) 433-1808 or email the Police Department through your GovQA account within 30 days of this message. \r\nRegards, \r\nRebecca \r\nTukwila Police Department \r\n206-433-1808",

FOIA does not impose an unbounded obligation to create requested information in a way that is usable or convenient for the requester. ACUS always attempts to provide records in the requested format, but that is not always possible. This reply is our best effort to provide you with the information without having to pay contractors to manipulate or present the information in your desired format.  There are no in-house IT personnel at our micro agency.\r\n\r\nYou will find attached two Outlook files-both sent to you yesterday in .pdf format. One file was modified to remove PII (after forwarding the document to myself so that it could be redacted). All links and such should be active. The redacted .pdf attachment to the redacted email was sent to you yesterday.\r\n\r\nAs for item 4, you specifically noted that ACUS could reply in a statement, which we did. ACUS has zero FTEs.  I attached the information about the FOIA.gov webpage as a convenience to you. If you have questions about that webpage, you should contact the Office of Information Policy at DOJ since they maintain the webpage.\r\n\r\nFinally, you requested that the documents be uploaded to some sort of database for which you provided a link.  It is a security risk to click on links from unknown sources. In any event, FOIA does not require agencies to plug their responses into a requester's database.\r\n\r\n\r\nShawne C.

To the extent that\r\nthe County\u2019s Purchasing Department has responsive documents, I will review\r\neach document and determine if there is confidential commercial or\r\nfinancial information from the vendor(s) that needs to be withheld or\r\nredacted from production pursuant to MPIA \u00a74-335. This includes certain\r\npricing data and information regarding a vendor\u2019s equipment or processes. A\r\nvendor would customarily not release such information to the public. I\r\nwould produce any responsive contractual documents with such confidential\r\ncommercial or financial information either withheld or redacted. With\r\nregard to the time it is taking to make the records available to you, we\r\nshall first notify the contractor of your request as a courtesy to them and\r\nto allow them a reasonable amount of time to determine what they believe is\r\nproprietary information in their proposal.\r\n\r\nYou may contact the Public Access Ombudsman per MPIA \u00a7 4-1B-04 regarding an\r\nissue you have with this response. You may also challenge any part of this\r\nresponse to your Request by filing an action in the appropriate court of\r\nlaw pursuant to MPIA \u00a7 4-362.

Your reply objects to the City's denial of access pursuant to OPRA's security exemption and based upon protecting the citizens' reasonable expectation of privacy who attended the Teaneck demonstration held on March 10, 2024.  The City evaluated its prior response in light of your reply, and its position remains that you are not legally entitled to access the requested materials.  In addition to the reasons set forth in the City's March 14, 2024 response, an additional reason that the requested materials are exempt from public access is that the underlying footage constitutes law enforcement records relating to citizens who were neither arrested nor charged.  See Fuster v. Twp. of Chatham, 477 N.J. Super. 477 (App. Div. 2023) (determining that government records involving a person who has not been arrested or charged with an offense are entitled to confidentiality based upon long-established judicial precedent).  As such, the City is legally precluded from releasing any footage of citizens generated during the March 10th demonstration.  We trust that this correspondence satisfies your concerns, and we again note that the City is closing out your OPRA request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor O'Brien (she/her)\r\nCity Clerk's Office - OPRA Clerk\r\n65 Central Avenue, 3rd Floor\r\nHackensack, NJ 07601\r\n(P): 201-646-3940\r\n(F): 201-457-1466\r\ntobrien@hackensack.org<mailto:tobrien@hackensack.org>",

There is no obligation for us to continue producing records that are not being collected by a requester. \r\nRCW 42.56.120(4) states that if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. \r\nWAC 44-14-04006(1) states that a records request has been fulfilled and can be closed if an entirely unclear request has not been clarified, a request or installment has not been claimed or reviewed, or the requestor cancels the request.

I also request any communications between the Port of Seattle and CBP pertaining to such OMB approvals, OMB control numbers, or PRA notices \nCBP is granting your request under the FOIA, Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.  Upon initial review of your request, we have determined that the following documents can be found on the internet at the following link: \nFacial Recognition Technology | U.S. Customs and Border Protection (https://www.cbp.gov/document/foia-record/facial-recognition-technology) \n\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account], mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. \nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \n\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \n\nPlease notate file number CBP-2020-041145 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \n\nSincerely, \n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n",

The full release of the requested records serves the public interest in understanding the history and evolution of the FBI's collection of intelligence with regard to racketeering organizations.\r\n\r\nThis request is made with intent to publish responsive records through MuckRock.com, a news outlet, and this should be categorized as a news media request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 853 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,786 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,500 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Therefore this request is for any additional funds received and their sources.
