The custodian will determine whether responsive records exist, and if so, compile the records for your review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the due date located on the individual \"Request #\" page for an estimate of when your records, if any, will be available.\u00a0This estimated due date may be adjusted depending on the nature of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that each request should be limited to one subject. For example, a request for the tax history of three separate properties should be filed as a separate request for each property. If you include the three properties in one request, you will be asked to refile each property as a separate request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote also that records may be in active use at this time and therefore not available for immediate review.\u00a0Additionally, in accordance with the Louisiana Public Records Law, the City of New Orleans strives to promptly release all records which contain only public information and are not otherwise exempt from the Public Records Law. The City must balance its commitment to open access with its legal obligation to review public records for such exceptions and exemptions prior to release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, please be advised that there may be a delay in responding to requests for a compilation of email messages. Requests for a compilation of email is a complex multistep process. The request must first be sent to the City's IT Department to retrieve the requested emails. The City's IT Department performs a search of the City's email system utilizing search terms. The IT Department then forwards the results to the Law Department. The emails must then be carefully examined by the Law Department to determine if there is any material that must be redacted for privacy concerns and otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the custodian notifies our office that the records have been compiled you will be invoiced by email. Once you pay the invoice, you may download the records. Alternatively, you may schedule a time to review or purchase copies of the records.\u00a0Thank you for your request, and we look forward to working with you to provide public records in a fair and efficient manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nLaw Department\r\n\r\nCity of New Orleans\r\n\r\n1300 Perdido St., Ste. 5E03\r\n\r\nNew Orleans, LA 70112\r\n\r\n(504) 658-9800\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Request #23-3745.\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of New Orleans.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",
