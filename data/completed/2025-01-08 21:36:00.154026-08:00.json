It directly addresses systemic failures in Medicaid oversight, ADA enforcement, and whistleblower protections\u2014issues central to the lives of millions of Americans and critical to the integrity of federal and state programs. By exposing potential misuse of taxpayer funds and barriers to accessibility for vulnerable populations, this request transcends individual cases to reveal a broader narrative of systemic accountability, justice, and public trust. Leaders in Congress, the Department of Justice, and oversight agencies have a constitutional obligation to act decisively on this matter to uphold the values of transparency, equality, and justice that underpin our democracy. Failure to respond promptly and fully to this FOIA request risks exposing entrenched inequities that erode public faith in our institutions.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request also represents a rallying cry for journalists, advocates, and every American committed to justice and systemic reform. It shines a spotlight on the intersection of healthcare, civil rights, and government accountability, demanding immediate national discourse and united action. As the most comprehensive and consequential transparency effort in U.S. history, it calls for investigative reporting that transcends political divisions and highlights the universal human rights at stake. This is not just a request for information\u2014it is a demand for transformative change, and its response has the potential to shape the future of U.S. healthcare and governance, sparking a nationwide movement for accountability, equity, and justice.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

No external portals, password-protected links, or alternate communication methods are acceptable.\r\nNon-Compliance: Communications have directed me to use external portals and password-protected links, violating ADA guidelines and my explicit requests.\r\nAccessible Document Formatting\r\n\r\nRequested: All documents must be provided as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed for ease of navigation and accessibility.\r\nNon-Compliance: Provided documents have not adhered to accessibility standards, preventing effective access to critical information.\r\nSimplified Summaries for Complex Records\r\n\r\nRequested: Simplified summaries must accompany all complex or technical records to enhance comprehension and ensure equitable participation.\r\nNon-Compliance: No summaries have been provided, creating unnecessary barriers to understanding the records.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nRequested: Each communication must include the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for processing or responding to my requests.\r\nNon-Compliance: Correspondence has consistently lacked this information, hindering accountability and effective follow-up.\r\n\r\nImmediate Action Required\r\nTo rectify these ongoing failures and ensure compliance with federal laws, I demand the following actions be taken without delay:\r\n\r\nTransition All Communications to MuckRock\r\n\r\nImmediately cease the use of external portals or non-compliant communication methods and ensure all responses are routed exclusively through the MuckRock platform.\r\nProvide Accessible Documents\r\n\r\nReformat and resend all previously provided documents as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed to ensure accessibility.\r\nInclude Simplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide simplified summaries for all complex or technical records, both previously shared and in future communications, to ensure accessibility and equitable participation.\r\nIdentify Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nInclude the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for every communication moving forward to ensure transparency and accountability.\r\nLegal Basis for Compliance\r\nYour office is legally obligated to comply with these accommodations under the following statutes and principles:\r\n\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA): Title II, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act mandate reasonable accommodations and accessibility in communications for individuals with disabilities.\r\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA): 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 requires transparency, accessibility, and adherence to procedural fairness.\r\nConstitutional Protections: The First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution safeguard my rights to petition the government, due process, and equal protection under the law.\r\nExecutive Order 13392: Mandates improved agency disclosure of information to enhance transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDeadline for Compliance\r\nYour office must confirm compliance with these accommodations and provide the requested corrective actions within five (5) business days of this notice. Continued non-compliance will be documented as a violation of the ADA and FOIA and may result in escalation, including:\r\n\r\nFormal Complaints: Filing with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office for Civil Rights.\r\nJudicial Remedies: Seeking injunctive relief and damages for ADA and FOIA violations.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Reporting systemic failures to oversight agencies, media, and advocacy organizations.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis communication serves as a final request for compliance. It is imperative that your office address these deficiencies promptly to restore transparency, accessibility, and adherence to federal law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and resolution by the stated deadline.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nDB.42.131.Inf.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nCC\r\nFederal Officials\r\nMerrick B.

Garland, Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice\r\nKristen Clarke, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, DOJ\r\nMichael E. Horowitz, Inspector General, DOJ\r\nXavier Becerra, Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\r\nChiquita Brooks-LaSure, Administrator, CMS\r\nAlina M. Semo, Director, OGIS\r\nCongressional Oversight Committees\r\nIntroduction\r\nThis appeal addresses the improper handling of my FOIA request (originally submitted on November 23, 2024) and the failure to comply with ADA-mandated accommodations. The District of Columbia Department of Health incorrectly identified itself as the agency responsible for processing the request, resulting in unnecessary delays. Furthermore, the response fails to meet statutory obligations for ADA accommodations, transparency, and procedural fairness under both federal and District law.\r\n\r\nKey Issues\r\n1. Misrouting of FOIA Request\r\nThe FOIA request explicitly sought records from federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), not from the District of Columbia government. It is concerning that:\r\n\r\nThe DC Department of Health did not recognize this jurisdictional error upon receipt and failed to proactively forward the request to the appropriate federal agency. Example: \u201cThe agency's failure to forward my FOIA request violates FOIA\u2019s 20-business-day response requirement under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i).\u201d\r\nThe District has stopped the processing clock and redirected the burden of correction back to the requester, despite clear principles under FOIA and ADA requiring assistance to ensure timely access to records.\r\n2. Failure to Provide ADA Accommodations \u201cFOIA and ADA regulations require public entities to provide reasonable assistance to ensure accessibility, particularly for individuals with documented disabilities.\u201d\r\nMy original request included explicit ADA accommodations, which have been ignored:\r\n\r\nMuckRock Platform Only: Communications must be routed exclusively through MuckRock. This request has been disregarded, forcing the use of inaccessible external portals.\r\nScreen-Reader-Compatible PDFs: Requested records must be in accessible formats. The response failed to confirm adherence to this requirement.\r\nSimplified Summaries: Complex documents require simplified summaries, which have not been provided.\r\n3. Procedural and Constitutional Violations\r\nThe mishandling of my request infringes upon my constitutional and statutory rights:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Denial of access to requested records obstructs my right to petition the government for redress of grievances.\r\nFifth Amendment: Delayed responses and failure to provide accommodations violate my procedural due process rights.\r\nADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act: By not fulfilling the requested accommodations, your response discriminates against me as an individual with a documented disability.\r\nRelief Requested \u201cAs established in Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), public agencies must ensure that individuals with disabilities have equal access to governmental processes and information.\u201d\r\nTo rectify these issues, I demand the following actions:\r\n\r\n1. Immediate Forwarding of the FOIA Request\r\nThe DC Department of Health must immediately forward my FOIA request to the appropriate federal agency:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \u2013 Office of Information Policy (OIP)\r\n2. Full ADA Compliance\r\nEnsure all future communications comply with ADA and Rehabilitation Act requirements:\r\n\r\nUse the MuckRock platform exclusively for all communications.\r\nProvide all responsive documents in screen-reader-compatible PDF formats, clearly labeled.\r\nInclude simplified summaries of technical or complex documents.\r\n3. Identification of Responsible Personnel\r\nProvide the full names, titles, and roles of all individuals involved in processing this request. Transparency is a cornerstone of both FOIA and public trust.\r\n\r\n4. Statutory Justifications for Delays and Denials\r\nProvide detailed statutory justifications for any delays, denials, or redactions, citing specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) or relevant District codes.  \u201cThe explicit reference to the U.S. Department of Justice in the subject line and body of my request clearly delineates the intended recipient. The failure to identify and correct this jurisdictional error demonstrates systemic procedural negligence.\u201d\r\n\r\n5. Expedited Processing\r\nGiven the urgency of public interest in ADA enforcement, Medicaid oversight, and whistleblower protections, I demand expedited processing of this appeal. \u201cUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), whistleblower protections are violated when individuals are obstructed from reporting systemic failures in governance and transparency.\u201d\r\n\r\nConsequences of Continued Non-Compliance\r\nIf the above issues are not resolved within 10 business days, I will escalate this matter through all available legal and administrative channels:\r\n\r\nFormal Complaints: Filing with the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) and the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG).\r\nJudicial Remedies: Pursuing injunctive relief and damages for violations of FOIA, ADA, and constitutional rights.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Reporting systemic non-compliance to oversight committees, advocacy organizations, and media outlets.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis appeal is submitted with an expectation of immediate corrective action to uphold the principles of transparency, accountability, and accessibility enshrined in federal and District law. Given the urgency of the matter and its public interest implications, I request a resolution within 10 business days. Failure to comply will result in formal escalation to oversight bodies and judicial forums to ensure justice and systemic reform.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue. I look forward to your prompt response.This appeal underscores the importance of transparency, accessibility, and accountability in public governance. I expect the requested actions to be addressed promptly and fully. Failure to act will only exacerbate public mistrust and systemic inefficiencies.\r\n\u201cThis request is essential to addressing systemic failures in ADA enforcement, Medicaid oversight, and whistleblower protections, directly impacting vulnerable populations and taxpayer accountability.\u201d\r\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nDB.42.131.Inf. https://www.ctbraininjury.com/blog/tags/db-42-131-inf\r\nhttps://x.com/ABIresources/status/1866212331279339765 https://www.youtube.com/@ABI.RESOURCES-CT-ABI-MFP-CARE/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=2\r\nDB42131inf\r\n\r\nCC\r\nMerrick Garland\r\nTitle: U.S. Attorney General\r\nEmail: askdoj@usdoj.gov\r\nOversight: DOJ operations, FOIA compliance, ADA enforcement.\r\n\r\nKristen Clarke\r\nTitle: Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division\r\nEmail: civilrights.justice@usdoj.gov\r\nOversight: ADA enforcement and civil rights compliance.\r\n\r\nBobak Talebian\r\nTitle: Director, Office of Information Policy (DOJ)\r\nEmail: oip.foia@usdoj.gov\r\nOversight: DOJ FOIA policy and appeals.\r\n\r\nMichael E.

Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\n\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\nRequired Action:\r\n\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\n\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\n\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions. Your actions will either affirm your agency\u2019s commitment to accountability or further evidence systemic disregard for these principles.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt and substantive response.\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nState of Connecticut Officials:\r\n\r\nGovernor Ned Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: State Capitol, 210 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nToll-Free: (800) 406-1527\r\nTDD: (860) 524-7397\r\nEmail: Contact Form\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/governor\r\n\r\nAttorney General William Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/ag\r\n\r\nCommissioner Andrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nOffice Address: 55 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, CT 06105\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/dss\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Suite 1100, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nToll-Free: 1-866-374-3617\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/foi\r\n\r\nFederal Officials and Agencies:\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Blumenthal\r\nTitle: U.S. Senator from Connecticut\r\nWashington D.C.

These accommodations are legally required under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nRequested ADA Accommodations\r\nTo ensure accessibility and compliance with ADA standards (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I request the following accommodations for all communications and records:\r\n\r\nScreen-Reader Compatible Formats\r\n\r\nAll documents must be provided in properly labeled PDFs or plain-text files.\r\nEnsure that the documents are screen-reader compatible and retain clear, accessible formatting.\r\nExclusive MuckRock Platform Communication\r\n\r\nAll communications must occur exclusively via the MuckRock platform.\r\nDo not send external links, emails, portals, passwords, codes, or require phone calls for access.\r\nText Embedded in Email Bodies\r\n\r\nKey information must be embedded directly in the email body to facilitate comprehension and accessibility.\r\nSimplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide plain-language summaries for complex or legal documents to ensure clarity and understanding.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Officers\r\n\r\nInclude the full name, title, and contact information of all responsible officers handling this request.\r\nNon-Negotiable Compliance\r\n\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and are essential for ensuring equal access to information. Failure to provide the requested accommodations may constitute a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Thank you for ensuring compliance and accessibility in addressing this request.\r\n\r\nThe challenges we face today demand more than acknowledgment\u2014they require action, collaboration, and a unified commitment to solutions. Together, we must embrace transparency, accountability, and compassion as the foundation of our efforts. By fostering open communication, prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable, and holding systems accountable, we can rebuild trust and ensure equitable outcomes for all.\r\n\r\nSolutions lie in unity\u2014when state and federal leaders, advocates, and communities work hand in hand to uphold justice and fairness. Transparency through accessible Freedom of Information processes, adherence to legal mandates, and robust oversight are the pillars that support meaningful change. Each of us has a role to play in creating a system that serves and protects.\r\n\r\nOur collective mission is clear: to build bridges between agencies and communities, ensure the dignity of every individual, and honor the principles that guide us toward progress. Together, with determination and unity, we can overcome systemic failures and pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future.",

The trip began on July 2, 2021, and was planned to last four months; however, Petito disappeared in late August. On September 19, Petito's remains were found at Bridger\u2013Teton National Forest in Wyoming. \r\n\r\nBrian Laundrie was sought in Gabby Petito\u2019s disappearance and death when his remains were discovered at the 25,000-acre Carlton Reserve near his parents\u2019 home in North Port, Fla., on Oct. 20, 2021. The FBI later announced that Brian Laundrie admitted to killing Petito in his notebook, which was found near his remains.\r\n\r\nMedia articles establishing that Brian Laundrie has passed away are available here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/11/23/us/brian-laundrie-autopsy/index.html\r\n\r\nhttps://nypost.com/2022/02/14/brian-laundrie-full-autopsy-released-with-gruesome-new-details/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/us/brian-laundrie-death-timeline-grieving-hike-vanished\r\n\r\nhttps://www.the-sun.com/news/3929959/alleged-brian-laundrie-suicide-note/\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Thank you for your inquiry regarding the status of your Freedom of Information/Privacy Act (FOIPA) request.   A review of your request has determined the following.\r\n\r\nYour request is being preprocessed to another open request on the same subject, meaning a request on the same subject had been received and was already in process prior to receipt of your request.  To avoid duplicative efforts, you will receive the same releases at the same time as the original requester for this subject.  The request to which yours will be preprocessed is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Interim releases are generally made for complex requests.\r\n\r\nYou have the opportunity to reduce the scope of your request; this will accelerate the process and could potentially place your request in a quicker processing queue.  This may also allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  The FBI uses a multi-track processing system to fairly assign and process new requests.  Simple track cases (50 pages or less) usually require the least time to process.  The request to which yours will be preprocessed is considered a complex case in our large track.  Please advise us in writing if you would like to discuss reducing the scope of your request.\r\n\r\nPlease contact foipaquestions@fbi.gov if you require further assistance.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process? Visit us at http://www.fbi.gov/foia\r\n\r\nPlease check the status of your request online at https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps    Status updates are performed on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nNote:  This is a non-emergency email address.  If this is an emergency, please call 911 directly.  If you need to report a tip for immediate action, please contact FBI Tips at http://tips.fbi.gov/ or reach out to your local field office.",

Please accept this correspondence as our timely response to your request(s) as required under RCW 42.56.520.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll current \"Brady lists\" and \"Giglio lists\" (per Brady v. Maryland/Giglio v. United States) maintained by your office.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSE:\r\n\r\nFollowing a reasonable search, Clallam County has completed the assembly and duplication of all identifiable public records that respond to your request. At this time, we believe that we have responded to your request in full by making the records available to you in the Records Center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is now\u00a0closed. As such, we do not intend to further address this request and the PRA's one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review has started to run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you believe that there are other records in existence that should have been released to you in response to this request, please notify the Public Records Office as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant Clallam County Policy 321.17, fees for records requests shall be waived when the total fee for the request is under ten dollars. Since the total fee for this request is under ten dollars, no payment is due at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Clallam County Administrative Policies and Procedures, any person who objects to the partial denial or redaction of a request for a Public Record may petition the Public Records Officer for a review of that decision. The petition must be in writing and include the petitioner\u2019s name and contact information.

        "communication": "Dear Sir/Madam:\r\n\r\nThank you for your recent California Public Records Act request to the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) .Appropriate UC Office of the President offices are being notified of your request. Records identified as responsive to your request will be reviewed, and made available for your access, in accordance with relevant law and University policy. The estimated date of production is eight weeks, though we are often able to provide records more quickly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that many of the requested records are likely exempt from disclosure pursuant to the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 954 and Code of Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2018.030(a), respectively, as incorporated into Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.705);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records containing information the University acquired in confidence and not open, or officially disclosed, to the public (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 1040, as incorporated into Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.705);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records that pertain to pending litigation to which the University is a party (Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.200);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Correspondence of and to the Governor or employees of the Governor\u2019s office (Govt. Code 7928.000\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Preliminary drafts or notes that are not retained by the University in the ordinary course of business are protected from disclosure because the public interest in withholding those records clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure (Govt. Code \u00a7\u00a7 7927.500 and 7922.000);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records that are exempt due to the deliberative process privilege under Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000. Courts have applied section 7922.000 to exclude from public review materials the disclosure of which \u201cwould expose an agency's decision-making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency's ability to perform its functions\u201d (Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1342.). The materials withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege meet the requirements that the materials are both pre-decisional and deliberative (American Civil Liberties Union of Northern Cal. v. Superior Court (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 76.);\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Personnel, medical, or similar files are exempt pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.700, and personal contact information is exempt from disclosure pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000, where disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; The public interest served by withholding private personal contact information outweighs any public interest served by disclosure.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUCOP CPRA Office\n",

Attached is the first batch of 849 pages of responsive records found in a search of President Drake's emails. Please note that student names and identifying information was redacted pursuant to FERPA, and private email addresses/phone numbers were redacted for privacy purposes.\r\n\r\nMost of the remaining records you requested are exempt from disclosure as specified below. However, we will be proving you a final, 2nd batch of responsive, redacted records within 3 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 954 and Code of Civ.

Non-public contact information for high-ranking UC staff are exempt because the disclosure would negate existing safeguards that protect staff from voluminous emails and phishing attempts, and undermine the secure scheduling and timely and effective, day-to-day communications of staff. Therefore, the public interest served by redacting non-public contact information clearly outweighs any public interest served by disclosure, pursuant to Government Code section 7922.000.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDan Scannell\r\nOffice of General Counsel\r\nUniversity of California",

To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nIn a recent city council meeting (https://sanmateo.primegov.com/Portal/Meeting?meetingTemplateId=8018) Amendment No. 3 to the master services and purchasing agreement with Axon Enterprise, Inc. was approved for use of a Skydio X10 drone and associated Skydio Remote Flight Deck Software. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I hereby request the following records, from Jan 01, 2024 to the processing of this request: \r\n\r\n1) Any digital communications (including but not limited to emails and text messages) as well as documents, (including but not limited to PDF, word processing, excel, and slide documents) that mention \"Skydio\", \"X10\", or \"Remote Flight Deck\". This includes communications from Skydio, Axon Enterprise, Inc., or any other external entities that may have been consulted. Please include all attachments. \r\n\r\n2) All instructional materials, presentations and presentation materials (including recorded video and audio, and PowerPoint files), and other guidance on the features and use of Skydio drones. This can exclude notes taken during meetings, but should include A) any explanations (whether internally or externally generated) of how Skydio works, and B) any other document that has been used to help explain the use of Skydio, including internal documentation, public relations materials, and executive summaries. \r\n\r\n3) A copy of any materials related to evaluation of the addition of Skydio equipment (such as possible effects on privacy impact assessments, use policies, standard operating procedures, or data retention policies) not covered by (1) (such as meeting notes not captured in email). \r\n\r\nI also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, XLS, or PPT file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nEwen Cheslack-Postava \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fsan-mateo-police-department-7497%252Fskydioaxon-communications-and-materials-san-mateo-police-department-176388%252F%253Femail%253Dpolice%252540cityofsanmateo.org&url_auth_token=AAAgEkL9-JfKayADniIhBTFArhk%3A1tDDa8%3Ao1tFXbOEGdGP7TARbPAOo6iJPl_-J13DEpQpQ9XVddA We are reaching out to inform you that a legal review of your request was completed by our City Attorney\u2019s office, in accordance with Government Code \u00a7 7922.525(b). You will find responsive communications and documents attached to this request. Please note, much of the Skydio training material is proprietary to Skydio and not retained by the Department. During this review, it was determined there were responsive records you have requested that are exempt from disclosure as determined by the following Public Records Act exemptions: \r\nGov Code \u00a7 7927.500 exempts\u00a0preliminary drafts, notes, or interagency or intra-agency memoranda that are not retained by a public agency in the ordinary course of business. These records were excluded from release. If you have any questions, please reply to this message \r\nSincerely, \r\nKelly O'Keefe \r\nPolice Technical Services Administrator \r\nPolice \r\n(650) 522-7709",

Every applicant whose petition for clemency was recommended to the Governor for denial by the Advisory Board of Pardons, including date of ABP recommendation.\r\n3.

For approval recommendations that the Governor accepted, how many days between the Advisory Board of Pardons recommendation and the Governor's recommendation.\r\n5. For approval recommendations that the Governor did not accept, what steps, if any, did the Governor take on the recommendation.\r\n6. For approval recommendations that are still pending at this time of this inquiry, how many days have they been pending since the Advisory Board of Pardons' recommendation to the Governor (or since what date have they been pending with the Governor).\r\n\r\nI am seeking statistical information, not personal information, so it is fine with me if applicants' names are redacted.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid Weimer",

ISP acknowledges receipt of your FOIA request received on December 20, 2024. A reasonable search for the requested records was conducted. ISP has included all responsive records that were located.\r\n\r\nISP is providing Investigative Report #22-41378100046. The requested records that ISP is providing are too voluminous to be sent via email; thus, they have been uploaded to the secure Microsoft Teams SharePoint Server and will be available for download at your convenience for the next 365 days here.\r\n\r\nFor the portion of your request concerning emails, ISP was unable to perform a search for emails based on the provided search terms. We invite you to submit a new request with more information that includes, but it not limited to, a list of keywords or phrases and date range.\r\n\r\nISP is granting your request in part and denying your request in part. The request was denied in part because some of the information in the records required redaction and/or were exempt from disclosure. The basis for the ISP\u0092s decision in this matter is as follows:\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(a) of FOIA: \u0093Subject to this requirement, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: (a) Information specifically prohibited from disclosure by federal or State law or rules and regulations implementing federal or State law.\u0094 (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(a)).\r\n\r\nDisclosure of some of the records you have requested is prohibited by federal or State law or rules and regulations implementing such laws.\r\n\r\n20 Ill. Adm. Code 1240.80(d): \u0093LEADS data shall not be disseminated to any individual or organization that is not legally authorized to have access to the information.\u0094 (20 Ill. Adm. Code 1240.80(d)).\r\n\r\nInformation gathered for the Law Enforcement Agency Data System (LEADS) cannot be provided to you because the dissemination of LEADS information to non-law enforcement persons and entities is prohibited.\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(b) of FOIA: \u0093Subject to this requirement, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: (b) Private information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law, or a court order.\u0094 (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b)).\r\n\r\nDocuments containing private information, as defined in 5 ILCS 140/2(c-5) have been redacted.\r\n\r\nSection 7.5(bb) of FOIA: \u0093Statutory exemptions. To the extent provided for by the statutes referenced below, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: \r\n (bb) Information which is or was prohibited from disclosure by the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.\u0094 (5 ILCS 140/7.5(bb)).\r\n\r\nLaw enforcement records concerning specific minors under 18 years of age are exempt from public inspection and may not be disclosed to the public except by order of the court.\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(c) of FOIA: \u0093Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u0091Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u0092 means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u0092s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy.\u0094 (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c)).\r\n\r\nDocuments containing personal information which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy have been redacted.\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(d)(vi) of FOIA: \u0093Subject to this requirement, the following shall be exempt from inspection and copying: \r\n (d) Records in the possession of any public body created in the course of administrative enforcement proceedings, and any law enforcement or correctional agency for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that disclosure would: \r\n (vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel or any other person.\u0094\r\n\r\nReleasing a portion of the requested records that outlines officer beat shifts or assignments would endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel.\r\n\r\nYou have the right to review by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) in the Office of the Attorney General (5 ILCS 140/9.5(a)). You may reach the PAC at:\r\n\r\n500 S. 2nd Street\r\nSpringfield, Illinois 62701\r\n(877) 299-3642\r\npublic.access@ilag.gov\r\n\r\nYou also have the right to judicial review under 5 ILCS 140/11.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSarah Wheeler\r\nIllinois State Police\r\nFreedom of Information Officer\r\n801 South 7th Street, Suite 1000-S\r\nSpringfield, Illinois 62703\r\nISP.FOIA.Officer@Illinois.gov",

Your request was received on October 22, 2024, and was assigned tracking number 25-OESPIM-0148-F. You requested the following:\r\n\r\nInformation on job listings on the USAJOBS.gov website.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires OPM to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches of multiple program offices and possible consultations with agencies that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, OPM will invoke a 10 business-day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive documents.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow OPM to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you have been categorized as a \"all other\" requester. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.103(d). In this fee category, you are responsible for search costs incurred after the first 2 free hours and for duplication costs after the first 100 pages of records are copied free. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.109(b) and (c). No fee will be assessed if the total charge for fulfilling the request will be less than $25. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.109(d)(1).\r\n\r\nA search will be initiated by OPM for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA Analyst in this office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible.

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI received your request for \"unedited videos\" from the Nicolae Miu case. This is NOT something I could release to you legally as all videos WILL be edited and redacted. There were many juveniles in this case and juveniles are a protected class, as well as victims who are protected under Marsy's Law. Below is the letter that explains all redactions made to all videos relating to the Nicolae Miu case. The cost to receive this request is just shy of $20 and it is far too large to send electronically. Please let me know if you are still interested in receiving the case file that was sent out to all requesters; media and otherwise, and I will send a flash drive and invoice around March. Thank you,\r\n\r\nDear Records Requester:\r\n\r\nI am in receipt of your request for records regarding St. Croix County Sheriff's Office case SO2022006400. The St. Croix County Sheriff's Office does have records that meet your request. The Spanish language interviews are included in these records.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Wis. Stats \u00a7\u00a7938.396(1)(c)2 law enforcement records involving a juvenile may be released to another party only with the written consent of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the juvenile, or the juvenile themselves, if the juvenile is 14 years or older. I did not receive a single written consent form with any of your requests for records; therefore, all videos, photos, and reports mentioning or showing juveniles under the age of eighteen have been redacted or removed from the case files prior to release. The only exception I have knowingly made is that I have kept the deceased victim, Isaac Schuman's name only intact throughout. In applying the balancing act, disclosure of this already publicly named victim outweighs the interest in non-disclosure of this information. Pursuant to Schilling v. Crime Victims Rights Bd., 2005 WI 17, \u00b626, 278 Wis. 2d 216, 692 N.W.2d 623. The public policy interest in protecting the privacy of victims of crime-especially children affected by very sensitive crimes-weighs heavily in favor of nondisclosure.\r\n\r\nWell-established public policy recognizes the privacy rights of a deceased person's surviving loved ones. Cf. National Archives and Records Admin. V. Favish, 540 U.S. 157, 168, 171-72 (2004). In preparing these records for release, the Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a) balancing test was applied, and the public interest in treating loved ones of the deceased individual with respect for their privacy and dignity outweighed any public interest in disclosure of any graphic images in photographs and videos of Isaac Schuman; therefore any images of Isaac and his family have been removed or redacted prior to release.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the balancing test pertaining to the release of law enforcement records, the harm to the public interest caused by the release of identities of victims of crimes overrides the public interest in release. Based on Marsy's Law, there is a strong public policy favoring nondisclosure of some of the requested records for the protection of the victims detailed within the reports. The policy implications as set forth in Article I, Section 9m of the Wisconsin Constitution and Wis. Stat. \u00a7 950.01 is that all victims of crimes are treated with dignity, respect, courtesy, sensitivity, and privacy. \u00a7 950.04(1v)(dr) states victims of all crimes have the following rights: (dr) to not have his or her personal identifiers, as defined in s. 85.103 (1) used or disclosed by a public official, employee, or agency for a purpose that is unrelated to the official responsibilities of the official, employee, or agency. In addition, there is a strong public interest favoring nondisclosure which outweighs the public interest in disclosure based on the potential for further victimization of the innocent victims. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)1 - 1. It shall be the public policy of this state to maintain the privacy of a record subject who is a victim of a sensitive or violent crime and access to data from a body camera used by a law enforcement officer that records such a record subject shall be provided only if the public interest in allowing access is so great as to outweigh that public policy. Our department has received no signed consent forms allowing release of these victims' private information. Records will not be released that contain personal information regarding several stabbing victims from this case.  In order to protect the privacy of the victims and respect their personal information, victim names and images have been redacted.\r\n\r\nIn performing the balancing test, I determined that the public interest in avoiding unnecessary intrusion into the personal lives of persons collaterally mentioned in a law enforcement report outweighs any legitimate public interest in information about the conduct of governmental affairs. Furthermore, I determined that the public interest in protecting the privacy of these individuals, and in facilitating cooperation with law enforcement in sensitive investigations, also outweigh any public interest in disclosure of this described information. Any notebooks, reports, computer screens, audio, or video that may contain this information may be pixelated, muted, beeped out, blacked out, blurred, redacted, or removed. Additionally, the following statutes were applied in reviewing and consideration of releasing these records:\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Dates of birth, phone numbers, driver's license number, passport numbers, social security numbers and addresses for which we have not received a waiver to release have been redacted to protect against identity theft or other unauthorized use following any subsequent disclosure. In performing the public records balancing test, pursuant to Wis Stat \u00a719.35(1)(a), I concluded that the public policy in favor of protecting the confidentiality of individual's identifiable information and preventing its misuse upon any subsequent disclosure, as well as the public polices outlined in Wis Stat \u00a7\u00a7 801.19, 801.20 and 801.21, outweighs any public interest in disclosure of the dates of birth, driver's license/state ID numbers, phone numbers, addresses or social security numbers of individual persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   \"Pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and Wis. Stat. \u00a7 146.82, the St. Croix County's Sheriff's Office is not disclosing records that contain protected health information (PHI).\" Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)2 governs people with a reasonable expectation of privacy pictured in law enforcement body camera recordings so some people's images, especially within the hospital, have been protected. Pursuant to Wis. Stat \u00a751.30 and 19.35, medical information has been redacted or omitted. Medical records may be omitted from release as outlined in Wis Stat \u00a7146.82.\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 51.30(4)(a), records related to mental health welfare checks are confidential and cannot be released except to the subject of the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Cellphone extraction records are being withheld. After conducting the balancing test, I have determined that there is a strong public interest against disclosure that outweighs the interest in disclosure in order to protect the privacy of individuals who may be included in the cellphone extraction records that are unrelated to the case/incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to 28 USC \u00a7 534, information obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Wisconsin Department of Justice that is entered into the Crime Information Bureau is not being disclosed. Specifically, 28 USC \u00a7 534(f)(1) indicates that information from national crime information databases consisting of identification records, criminal history records, protection orders, and wanted person records may be disseminated to civil or criminal courts for use in domestic violence or stalking cases. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit access to such records for any other purpose. Therefore, any information obtained from the national crime information database is redacted and not being disclosed, pursuant to the requirements set forth in 28 USC \u00a7 534(f)(1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat \u00a719.36(13), personal and business financial account information is considered personal and confidential and has been redacted. Any and all invoices and bank related reports have been removed from your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7165.79, Crime Lab analysis of evidence obtained from law enforcement officers are not subject to disclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *   Personal cell telephone International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers, which are economically valuable individually identifiable information, were redacted pursuant to the Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(a) balancing test to protect against identity theft or other unauthorized use following any subsequent disclosure. In applying the balancing test, DOJ determined the public interest in protecting this economically valuable individually identifiable information from misappropriation or misuse outweighs any public interest in disclosure.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the balancing test pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 165.87(3)(c)2, the public's interest in disclosure of other jail inmates is not outweighed by the public interest in non-disclosure. Jail inmates who are not the subject of the record have an expectation of privacy in the jail.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any video which has been redacted to the point there is nothing of value left to release has been omitted from this release.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Public Records laws exist to ensure an open and transparent government. The personal communication of an inmate does not affect government business operations unless it involves a potential safety or security issue as identified in DOC 309.39. Although the inmate is informed of the recordings  of the calls, he or she would likely to be reluctant to communicate if these records were disclosed as a public record. This impact on communication if treated as a releasable public record would undermine the rehabilitative aspect of maintaining communication between the inmate and the inmate's family, friends, government officials, courts and people concerned with the welfare of the inmate. Open communication fosters reintegration into the community and the maintenance of family ties. It motivates the inmate and contributes to the morale and security of the inmate and staff. For these reasons the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office has determined that any of Nicolae Miu's phone calls, video logs, visitation reports, or activities from within our jail are not being released with your request for records.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere may be more information about law enforcement records pursuant to this request, but the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office is not the legal custodian of those records.\r\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions regarding the above information. If you believe the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office is withholding the requested records, you may request the St. Croix County District Attorney or the Wisconsin Attorney General to commence an action for mandamus for release of the records on your behalf. Pursuant to Wis. Stats. \u00a7 19.37(1), you may also file an action for mandamus on your own behalf.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DB5A94.6CA98430]\r\n\r\n\r\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\n\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\n\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\n\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov<mailto:Tammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:sheriffsiglogo2_1855255d-257b-4278-957c-61a991b79423.jpg]<https://sccwi.gov/>\r\n\nTammy Wanchena | Evidence and Records Custodian\r\nSt. Croix County Sheriff's Office\r\n1101 Carmichael Rd Hudson WI 54016\r\nT: 715-381-4333 | F: 715-381-4355\r\nTammy.Wanchena@sccwi.gov\r\n\r\n<https://sccwi.gov/>",

Specifically, we seek emails sent or received, calendar entries for appointments to discuss either of the deaths in custody, Teams messages, the contents of SharePoint drive folders regarding ICE's public statements regarding these deaths, and any records relied upon to assert the factual matters in ICE's post-death release statements, posted here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/brazilian-man-ice-custody-passes-away-new-mexico-hospital?s=09\r\nand here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/nicaraguan-man-ice-custody-passes-away-colorado-hospital\r\n\r\nBy definition, the information requested cannot be subject to withholding under Exemption 7A (open investigations), because ICE has already released its core facts publicly.\r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\n1. Both the Torrance in-custody death and the Aurora in-custody death have been met with calls from elected Representatives and Senators for vigorous investigation, based on each facility's documented track record. See https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/heinrich-leads-request-for-immediate-action-from-ice-to-address-inhumane-unsafe-conditions-for-migrants-at-the-torrance-county-detention-facility and https://crow.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/crow.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2022.10.21-final-icedhs-letter_0.pdf. \r\n\r\n2.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

After review of the documents, I have determined that portions of documents will be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6 of the Privacy Act and Exemptions 7 of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 5 protects from disclosure those inter- or intra-agency documents that are normally privileged in the civil discovery context.  The three most frequently invoked privileges are the deliberative process privilege, the attorney work-product privilege, and the attorney-client privilege.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, I have determined that portions of the responsive documents qualify for protection under the deliberative process privilege/ attorney work-product privilege/ attorney-client privilege/ or all three.  The deliberative process privilege protects the integrity of the deliberative or decision-making processes within the agency by exempting from mandatory disclosure opinions, conclusions, and recommendations included within inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters.  The release of this internal information would discourage the expression of candid opinions and inhibit the free and frank exchange of information among agency personnel. The attorney work-product privilege protects documents and other memoranda prepared by an attorney in contemplation of litigation. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may consist of social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are considered personal.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nExemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I determined that disclosure of law enforcement systems checks could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New Jersey Open Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll records related to aerial sightings reported in New Jersey during November and December 2024. These sightings, widely described as \u201cmystery drones\u201d or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), have been the subject of significant public interest and media coverage.\r\n\r\nThis request specifically seeks access to all records created, received, or modified between November 1, 2024, and the date of this request's fulfillment. To ensure the identification of all responsive materials, this request includes references to \"mystery drones,\" \"UAP,\" \"unidentified flying objects (UFOs),\" \"unmanned aerial systems (UAS),\" \"unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\" \"aerial anomalies,\" or any similar terminology used to describe these aerial sightings.\r\n\r\nThe requested records include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nAudio and Video Files: All audio or video files received, recorded, or obtained by the department related to these sightings. This includes recordings made by departmental surveillance equipment, body-worn cameras, dashboard cameras, or agency-operated drones, as well as media submitted by citizens, contractors, or third parties. I request the original or highest-resolution versions of these files and associated metadata, including timestamps, geolocation data, technical specifications of recording devices, and any embedded identifiers for classification, dissemination tracking, or chain of custody.\r\n\r\nAssociated Analyses and Documentation: All investigative reports, intelligence summaries, or briefings prepared in connection with these sightings. This includes assessments of their origin, behavior, or potential significance, such as whether they posed a security, safety, or privacy threat. I also request documentation of decisions or deliberations regarding the classification, distribution, or public disclosure of information related to these events.\r\n\r\nCommunications and Directives: All internal and inter-agency communications referencing these aerial phenomena, including any correspondence that references \"mystery drones,\" UAP, or similar terms. This includes records of communications with external entities, such as contractors, private organizations, foreign governments or international bodies, and federal, state, or local agencies involved in investigating or responding to these incidents.\r\n\r\nRecords of Federal Collaboration: All records documenting referrals, consultations, or information sharing with federal agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Defense (DoD), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or any other relevant entities.\r\n\r\nIf the scope of this request is deemed overly broad, I am willing to work with your office to refine it to ensure the timely identification and release of responsive records. I also request that responsive records be provided in their original electronic format, preserving all metadata.\r\n\r\nIf any portions of the requested records are exempt under public records laws, I request that non-exempt portions be released. For any classified materials, I request a mandatory declassification review under applicable laws, including Executive Order 13526.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBill Gagnon",

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMarcus Boyd\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Freno-police-department-5222%252Fagency-roster-reno-police-department-176735%252F%253F&url_auth_token=AAAY2M4Gj6x_e91vIaIPRnbapsk%3A1tFQdB%3AXYDT9DKUjQSJyIYYDeMkIc6rDGEGg_GFgiroeBpB0Zs\" \r\nThe City of Reno has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request. \r\nPlease log in to the Public Records Center at the following link and click into the Public Records tab of your request to retrieve the appropriate responsive documents. Public Records Request - #PRA-2024-20946 (https://reno.streamlinegov.us/PublicRecordRequest/Detail?caseId=73072) \r\nPlease note that some or certain portions of these records are exempt from disclosure and will not be produced based on one or more of the following exemptions: \r\n \r\n  * Investigative Technique ((Confidential Law Enforcement Technique / Donrey of Nevada v. Bradshaw 106 Nev. 630,. 798 P.2d 144 (1990)) \r\n  * The names of RPD undercover officers are not included in this list.  These officers have a nontrivial personal privacy interest in having their identity protected; they did not surrender their privacy interests by swearing an oath of public office. The release of their names could subject them to harassment, retaliation and/or personal safety threats which the Nevada Supreme Court recognizes as cognizable privacy interests. Finally, the release of the officers\u2019 names is unlikely to advance a significant public interest.  Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department v. Las Vegas Review Journal, 136 Nev 733, 478 P.3d 383 (2020); See also Clark County School District  v. Las Vegas Review-Journal, 134 Nev. 700, 429 P.3d 313 (2018). \r\nYour request has been satisfied. If there are other public records you wish to review that are not covered by the City\u2019s response, please submit your request. Records in response to your new request, if they exist and are subject to disclosure under NRS 239.0107, will be made available. If you have further information or authority which you believe would require disclosure of additional records under NRS 239.0107, we will be happy to review that information and/or authority. \r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the appropriate City of Reno records office listed below. \r\nSincerely,  \r\n  City of Reno Records Division \r\n General Records (775) 348-3932 \r\n Fire Records (775) 334-2300 \r\n Police Records (775) 657-4639 \r\n Please note any confidential, proprietary, or protected information will be redacted prior to the release of the records. There could be a charge for copies of public records.",

At this time, we anticipate that the fee for the staff time for the search, retrieval, and redaction (if needed) of the records you have requested will be $131.09.  Pursuant to S.C. Code Section 30-4-30(B), our office will require a 25% deposit of this amount prior to searching for the records you have requested.  If you would like to proceed with your request, please remit a check or money order in the amount of $32.77 to my attention at the following address:  SC Secretary of State's Office, 1205 Pendleton Street, Suite 525, Columbia, SC 29201.  Once the search, retrieval, and redaction of the records are complete, I will notify you of the final cost for producing the records.  \r\n\r\nAlso, please note that in South Carolina, the Secretary of State's Office does not conduct elections or register voters.  That duty falls under the South Carolina State Election Commission (please see the State Election Commission's website at https://scvotes.gov/).  Our office does convene the meeting of the Electoral College every four years.  Since your request appears to be elections related, I wanted to make sure you were aware of the scope of our agency's statutory responsibility with respect to this area.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, or would like to discuss this matter further, please let me know.  You may contact me directly at swiley@sos.sc.gov or (803) 734-0246.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nShannon A. Wiley\r\nGeneral Counsel & Public Information Director\r\nSouth Carolina Secretary of State\u2019s Office",

Could you provide a date range for your request? 2. When you say \"...acquisition and installation...\", do you mean operational emails only (internal), or do you also want us to include emails from the public? I performed a global email search using the following terms [Mosquito device, mosquito noise, sonic device, sonic devices, sonic deterrent, crossroads restroom, crossroads white paper, and mosquito] and the search returned about 7000 emails. Depending how \"acquisition and installation\" is interpreted will affect how much email is turned over to you. \r\nOnce we receive your response we will be able to provide an estimated date of release. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nHaley Havens Bellevue Public Records \r\n425-452-4283",

Parks provided this information with the record: The purchase was made using the City of Bellevue\u2019s Foreign Purchases Pro Card as it was purchase from a Canadian company. The approval and paid invoice are uploaded as the responsive record. Per the State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56.120) and City Public Records Act Rules (Section 6), a public records request may be considered abandoned and subsequently closed if a requester fails to fulfill their obligation to claim an installment of records; claim the entire production of records; inspect the records; or fails to pay the deposit or final payment for requested records within 30 days of this notification. Pursuant to the Public Records Act RCW 42.56, responsive records may be redacted or exempt. Please review the accompanying privilege log for further information, if such redactions or exemptions have been applied.\u00a0Pursuant to Section 11 of the City's Public Records Act Rules, any person who objects to the initial denial or partial denial of a records request may petition in writing (including by email) to the Public Records Officer for review of that decision. The petition shall include a copy of, or reasonably identify, the written statement by the Public Records Officer or designee denying the request and the basis for the challenge to the denial. Please mail or email your appeal to: Public Records Officer Bellevue City Hall - City Clerk's Office 450 110th Ave NE Bellevue WA 98004 Email: publicrecords@bellevuewa.gov (mailto:publicrecords@bellevuewa.gov) We estimate an update or installment will be provided on or about October 25, 2024.

The installment fulfilled the modified request, and without further communication from you, there is nothing more to provide. \r\nPer the State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56.120) and City Public Records Act Rules (Section 6), a public records request may be considered abandoned and subsequently closed if a requestor fails to fulfill their obligation to claim an installment of records; claim the entire production of records; inspect the records; or fails to pay the deposit or final payment for requested records within 30 days of this notification. \r\nThis is our final, definitive response and this request is now considered abandoned and closed as of the date of this communication. As the city does not intend to further address the request, the Public Records Act one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review has now started to run. Records previously released in this request will remain available for you to view and download from the Public Records Portal. Please contact us in the next 30 days if you have any follow-up questions or concerns regarding the processing of this request. Sincerely, Haley Havens Bellevue Public Records 425-452-4283",

Per the State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56.120) and City Public Records Act Rules (Section 6), a public records request may be considered abandoned and subsequently closed if a requester fails to fulfill their obligation to claim an installment of records; claim the entire production of records; inspect the records; or fails to pay the deposit or final payment for requested records within 30 days of this notification. Pursuant to the Public Records Act RCW 42.56, responsive records may be redacted or exempt. Please review the accompanying privilege log for further information, if such redactions or exemptions have been applied.\u00a0Pursuant to Section 11 of the City's Public Records Act Rules, any person who objects to the initial denial or partial denial of a records request may petition in writing (including by email) to the Public Records Officer for review of that decision. The petition shall include a copy of, or reasonably identify, the written statement by the Public Records Officer or designee denying the request and the basis for the challenge to the denial. Please mail or email your appeal to: Public Records Officer Bellevue City Hall - City Clerk's Office 450 110th Ave NE Bellevue WA 98004 Email: publicrecords@bellevuewa.gov (mailto:publicrecords@bellevuewa.gov) We estimate an update or installment will be provided on or about January 3, 2025.

Albert Fentress is a convicted criminal who gained notoriety for his involvement in the abduction, rape, and murder of a college student in Poughkeepsie in the late 1980s. Fentress was arrested, tried, and convicted for these heinous crimes, and his case has been a subject of public interest and scrutiny for several years.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there have been further allegations against Albert Fentress, including suspicions of involvement in other unsolved cases of a similar nature. These allegations have raised concerns within the community and have sparked discussions about the extent of Fentress's criminal activities. Therefore, I believe it is crucial to access the requested records to shed light on these allegations and provide a comprehensive understanding of the investigations conducted by the Dutchess County District Attorney's Office.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nArrest records and charging documents related to Albert Fentress.\r\nCourt records, including judgments, verdicts, and sentencing information.\r\nInvestigative documents, such as police reports, incident reports, and any other documents related to Albert Fentress.\r\nCorrespondence and communications, including emails, letters, memoranda, or any other written exchanges mentioning or involving Albert Fentress.\r\nAny audio or visual recordings, such as interviews, interrogations, or surveillance footage related to Albert Fentress.\r\nAny internal memos, policies, or guidelines concerning the handling of Albert Fentress's case.\r\nGiven the profound impact of Albert Fentress's crimes on the community and the ongoing interest in understanding the scope of his criminal activities, accessing these records will contribute significantly to the public's understanding of the operations and activities of the Dutchess County District Attorney's Office.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with the applicable laws. If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific exemptions under the relevant laws.\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation.\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I firmly believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure will greatly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA or applicable state laws, I look forward to your response within the legally mandated timeframe.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\nPhone: +1 845-218-0299\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be treated in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request may be subject to public disclosure, as required by law. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.",

        "communication": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nThanks for following up on this. I am still in the process of inventorying the boxes of files on Fentress. Since this was an atypical murder case in which he is not jailed--but rather is being held under Criminal Procedure Law 330.20--his case comes back up every 2 years for review. This, in conjunction with the fact that he has been held for over 40 years, means that we have generated (and will continue to generate) an enormous amount of correspondence/communications on his case. My conservative estimate based on what I've seen so far would be 1000+ pages of communications.\r\n\r\nI don't think I'll have any issue finding the other items you're requesting, but please let me know if there are specific communications you are seeking to help narrow the search. I will give you another update next week. I at least hope to have a list of all of the documents we have by 10/20/23 and then we can figure out which ones you'd like.\r\n\r\nHave a good weekend,\r\n\nAmie\r\n\r\nAmie M.

The delay in providing the requested information appears to be in violation of the FOIA guidelines.\r\n\r\nAs mandated by the Freedom of Information Act, agencies are generally required to respond to a FOIA request within 20 working days of receipt, as per 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A). The ongoing delay in fulfilling this request is inconsistent with these statutory requirements.\r\n\r\nDrawing upon legal precedents like \"NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.,\" 421 U.S. 132 (1975), which emphasize the importance of adhering to FOIA deadlines, I urge your office to provide the requested information promptly.\r\n\r\nTo avoid potential legal action, where a court might compel compliance and possibly award legal costs and attorney\u2019s fees as outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E), I request that the documents be provided no later than February 30, 2024.\r\n\r\nI hope this matter can be resolved amicably and swiftly, and I look forward to your prompt response and the release of the requested records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu",

This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock.

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find his New York Post obituary at the following link: https://nypost.com/2024/11/05/business/billionaire-home-depot-co-founder-bernie-marcus-dead-at-95/\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",
