        "communication": "Dear MuckRock Representative Samuel Sinyangwe,\r\nThis e-mail is in response to your open records request, assigned PIR25-0080.\r\nThe purpose of this e-mail is to seek clarification and narrow your request to specific records.\r\nYou did not provide the requisite information or enough specific information in order for this agency to perform an accurate search for records.\r\nIf you do not have the case/report numbers, please provide the following:\r\n\r\n  *\r\nExact date(s)\r\n  *\r\nSpecific location/address\r\n  *\r\nApproximate time frame of each incident(s)\r\n  *\r\nNames of person depicted\r\n\r\nThis agency does not obtain search abilities for all \"use of force incidents,\" in any date range.\r\nOnce you provide enough information in order for this agency to perform an accurate search for records, only public information will be released which includes, mugshots, press releases, arrest sheets, warrants, probable case warrant affidavits and a basic coversheet and a basic public narrative under the Limitations on the Scope.\r\nDigital evidence and records beyond the Limitations on the Scope are not included in public information under law relating to active offense reports of an arrested individual under TGC Sec. 552.108(c).\r\nAny requests seeking records beyond a public copy will be submitted to the Texas Office of the Attorney General in Austin. I will claim all applicable exceptions under law, seeking to withhold the records from public disclosure. The TxOAG will render a ruling within 45 to 55-business days. This process can take up to 90-business days to complete. Charges apply pending the TxOAG ruling.\r\nPlease respond and clarify/narrow your request within 61-days and advise me of how you wish for me to proceed, ie: (Please include if you seek the public copies in accordance with state exceptions, or do you seek a ruling from the TxOAG and agree to said charges?). Failure to respond within 61-days will result in an automatic withdraw of your request under TGC Sec. 552.222. If you wish to discuss how I may assist you in narrowing your request, please feel free to reach out and I will be happy to accommodate you. Please clarify and state if you seek the public copies under the exceptions listed within state law or if you seek a ruling submission from the Texas Office of the Attorney General in Austin. (public copies under 50-pages are provided electronically via e-mail at no charge). We do not waive open records/public information processing charges. We do not access links or attachments from outside sources for security reasons. We do not obtain drop box or similar access to our records.\r\nIf you have further inquiries or questions, please feel free to contact me and I will be happy to assist or direct you.\r\nTexas' open records laws are promulgated and set forth by Texas Legislature under the Texas Public Information Act. You may find a current version free-of-charge in .pdf format, desktop downloadable version on the Texas Office of the Attorney General's Website under the open government tab. You may also find all rights, mandates, requirements and regulations for both the requestor and governmental bodies on this site.\r\nRespectfully,\nDeputy Danie Huffman\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nParker County Sheriff's Office\r\n(682) 229-2358\r\n[cid:ab3d4775-302d-4692-919b-e95b8ba941ee]",

I've received your FOIA request for use of force records, and I have a couple of follow-up questions. We charge $15 per hour to retrieve and redact records. If you'd like to proceed with the request we can talk about the different classes of records and how long it will take to collect them. We've gone through a few different data systems in that period of time.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is South Carolina's FOIA statute creates a system for citizens to learn and report the activities of public officials. We are unable to provide a FOIA response to out of state inquiries.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in this information, please give me a call at 803 554 9123, and I may be able to provide an alternative route.\r\n\nThanks for your time,\r\nJason Allen",

        "communication": "Greetings,\r\n                After reviewing this further, this request will be time intensive.\r\n\r\nSome background information for you. In NY we are required to submit Use of force reports to Albany DCJS monthly. This is law and required and completed online. We in Clinton County do NOT keep a database or spread sheet of any use of force.\r\n\r\nBased on our Records Management System and Jail Management System, we cannot search only for use of force incidents.\r\n\r\nYou are also asking for several years\u2019 worth of reports from 1/1/2017 until now.\r\n\r\nAfter discussions, it appears that this could take a minimum of 210 days for the lowest paid, competent person to identify, redact and prepare these documents from each division. There are roughly 21,000 Patrol incidents that need to be hand reviewed to determine if there is a use of force. This would take the lowest paid person roughly 8 hours to review 100 reports and correlate the data. You are then asking for 210 days\u2019 worth of work, at $23.90 and hour. This is 1680 hours which equals to $40,152.00.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am working on the estimate for the jail at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n( See NY CLS Public Officers law , Art 6 FOIL (c)  In determining the actual cost of reproducing a record, an agency may include only:\r\n\r\ni.  an amount equal to the hourly salary attributed to the lowest paid agency employee who has the necessary skill required to prepare a copy of the requested record;\r\n\r\nii.  the actual cost of the storage devices or media provided to the person making the request in complying with such request;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been advised that I would need you to agree to the cost of the FOIL, and pay prior to directive that the extensive work to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI should also note as stated above. NYS DCJS and NYS Commission on Corrections both are repositories for this exact data and have it in an electronic format.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease advise if you wish to move forward or rescind your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Nicholas J Leon\r\nChief Deputy\r\nClinton County Sheriff's Office\r\nPatrol Division\r\nNorthern Regional Special Response Team\r\n25 McCarthy DrivePlattsburgh, NY 12901\r\n(518) 565-4214 Office\r\n(518) 565-4371 Fax\r\n [cid:image001.jpg@01DC902B.F5E1ED50]\r\nWell Being Notice: Receiving this email outside of normal working hours?
