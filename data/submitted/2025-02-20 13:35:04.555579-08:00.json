        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. All records concerning the US Attorney for the District of Columbia's initiative called \"Operation Whirlwind,\" as noted in the February 19, 2025 Washington Post article \"D.C. U.S. Attorney probing Democrats over alleged threats, documents show (https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/19/trump-justice-operation-whirlwind-democrats/)\r\n\r\n2. All communications to or from the office of US Attorney for the District of Columbia concerning \"Operation Whirlwind.\"\r\n\r\n3. All communications, dated February 1, 2025 to the present, sent to or from the office of US Attorney for the District of Columbia concerning real, potential, or perceived threats directed at government workers or officials. \r\n\r\n4. All communications, dated January 21, 2025 to the present, sent to or from the office of US Attorney for the District of Columbia concerning real, potential, or perceived threats directed at Elon Musk.\r\n\r\n5. All \"letters of inquiry,\" dated January 21, 2025 to the present, sent from the office of US Attorney for the District of Columbia concerning any statements made about or related to Elon Musk, President Donald Trump, or any United States Supreme Court justices. \r\n\r\n6. All records, created from January 21, 2025 and beyond, of the US Attorney for the District of Columbia that concern (a) \"limits\" on freedom of speech; (b) \"limits\" on the First Amendment; or (c) \"limits\" on freedom of the press. \r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.5(e)(ii) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website.\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia creating an initiative called \"Operation Whirlwind\" that involves issues concerning free speech and the First Amendment.  \r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a breaking news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of recent news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis because it concerns the policies and actions of federal law enforcement concerning the publication of information and other protected speech concerning government officials and activities. Those policies and decisions are uncertain, as indicated by the news articles below and the US Attorney's quotes in those articles. Disclosing policies and information pertaining to ongoing decisions and policies facilitates the ability of the public, the press, and advocates to provide feedback with respect to those decisions and policies. If that information is only disclosed months or years later, it will inhibit the ability of the public to understand how its current officials are making decisions.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include:\r\n\r\nThe Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/19/trump-justice-operation-whirlwind-democrats/\r\nMSNBC: https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-appointed-prosecutor-kicks-operation-whirlwind-eyes-schumer-rcna192878\r\nDaily Mail: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14417481/Trump-launches-Operation-Whirlwind-probe-potential-threats-Democrats-against-Elon-Musk.html\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.10(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the policies, procedures, and practices of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia as it pertains to the publications of information about government activities, implicating the Speech and Press clauses of the First Amendment.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Office's activities and operations, as the information pertains to the policies and underlying information driving decisions by senior law enforcement officials. Disclosing the policies and other information would demonstrate the bases for those decisions, which have attracted substantial public attention, as demonstrated by the articles and press statements cited above. That information is not in the public domain.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law, including its application to members of the press. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news, and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles) can be found at https://thefire.org/news.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJT Morris",

While that appeal is pending, I seek additional documentation to understand:\r\n\t1.\tThe full scope of NRPD\u2019s communications with ICE, including policy discussions, operational cooperation, and legal directives.\r\n\t2.\tNRPD\u2019s internal handling of public records requests related to ICE, including any coordination that may have influenced the FOIL response process.\r\n\t3.\tDocumentation of FOIL handling procedures, tracking of FOIL requests, and certifications or training of employees responsible for processing FOIL requests.\r\n\t4.\tInternal communications, including emails, memos, and metadata, regarding my prior FOIL request, involving NRPD, ICE, legal counsel, or other relevant parties.\r\n\r\nRequested Records\r\n\r\nI request access to all responsive records, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Communications Between NRPD and ICE\r\n\r\nAll emails, letters, memos, reports, meeting notes, text messages, chat logs, attachments, and other forms of correspondence exchanged between NRPD and ICE from January 1, 2020, to the present, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tPolicy discussions regarding cooperation between NRPD and ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tDetainer requests, notifications, and NRPD\u2019s policies on detainer compliance.\r\n\t\u2022\tJoint actions, task forces, information-sharing programs, or investigative efforts related to immigration enforcement.\r\n\t\u2022\tAgreements, memoranda of understanding (MOUs), funding arrangements, or grants between NRPD and ICE concerning immigration enforcement or related public safety efforts.\r\n\t\u2022\tLegal guidance or directives provided by ICE to NRPD regarding local-federal collaboration on immigration matters.\r\n\r\n2. Internal NRPD Discussions on Processing FOIL Requests Related to ICE\r\n\r\nAll internal emails, memos, notes, and records reflecting discussions within NRPD and between NRPD and other city agencies or departments regarding:\r\n\t\u2022\tThe processing of FOIL requests related to ICE communications or immigration enforcement activities.\r\n\t\u2022\tInstructions, training materials, or legal guidance provided to NRPD personnel on handling FOIL requests concerning ICE-related matters.\r\n\t\u2022\tDiscussions among NRPD staff or between NRPD and the Law Department about approving, denying, or redacting information in FOIL requests related to ICE.\r\n\t\u2022\tJustifications for exemptions used to withhold ICE-related records under FOIL.\r\n\t\u2022\tMetadata for all email and electronic communications related to FOIL processing for ICE-related requests, including sender/recipient information, timestamps, and subject lines.\r\n\r\n3. FOIL Processing Records, Tracking Logs, and Employee Certifications\r\n\r\nAll records related to NRPD\u2019s processing and tracking of FOIL requests, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tFOIL request tracking logs or databases maintained by NRPD from January 1, 2020, to the present, detailing:\r\n\t\u2022\tRequest numbers, dates of receipt, processing statuses, assigned personnel, response deadlines, and resolution statuses (granted, denied, or pending).\r\n\t\u2022\tExtensions requested for FOIL responses and their justifications.\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal policies, standard operating procedures, or manuals used by NRPD to process FOIL requests, including instructions on redactions, legal reviews, and response coordination.\r\n\t\u2022\tEmployee training records, certifications, or qualifications for FOIL officers and personnel responsible for processing public records requests.\r\n\t\u2022\tDesignations or delegations of authority for employees assigned to handle public records requests.\r\n\t\u2022\tCommunications or audits related to FOIL compliance, delays, or procedural issues in fulfilling FOIL requests.\r\n\r\n4. Internal Communications Regarding My Prior FOIL Request\r\n\r\nAll emails, memos, notes, and metadata related to internal NRPD discussions regarding my prior FOIL request, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tCorrespondence between NRPD, ICE, or legal counsel concerning my FOIL request and its processing.\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal discussions on whether or how to respond to my FOIL request.\r\n\t\u2022\tEmails or messages between NRPD staff and legal counsel discussing FOIL exemptions, withholding strategies, or potential legal risks related to my request.\r\n\t\u2022\tDirectives from NRPD officials, the Law Department, or other agencies regarding the handling of my request.\r\n\t\u2022\tMetadata for all emails related to my FOIL request, including sender/recipient information, timestamps, and subject lines.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for Disclosure\r\n\r\nNew York\u2019s FOIL operates under a presumption of access, meaning all government records are accessible unless a specific exemption applies. The agency bears the burden of proving that a record falls squarely within a FOIL exemption by articulating a particularized and specific justification for denying access. Conclusory assertions are insufficient to deny access.  \ufffc\r\n\r\n1. Communications with ICE Are Not Exempt Under \u00a7 87(2)(g)\r\n\t\u2022\tThe inter-agency or intra-agency exemption does not apply to external communications with federal agencies like ICE.  \ufffc\r\n\t\u2022\tCourts have ruled that communications between state and federal agencies are not protected under inter-agency exemptions.  \ufffc\r\n\r\n2. Internal FOIL Processing Records Are Subject to Disclosure\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords detailing how an agency processes a FOIL request must be disclosed unless they contain privileged legal advice.  \ufffc\r\n\t\u2022\tAgencies cannot claim exemption for deliberations on responding to FOIL requests unless they meet strict attorney-client privilege standards.\r\n\r\n3. FOIL Processing Logs, Employee Certifications, and Tracking Data Are Public Records\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords related to the internal processing and tracking of FOIL requests do not fall under any valid exemption.\r\n\t\u2022\tFOIL officers\u2019 training and certification records are public records and must be disclosed upon request.\r\n\r\n4. Internal Discussions Regarding My FOIL Request Must Be Released\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal discussions about whether to approve, deny, or delay a FOIL request must be disclosed unless they fall strictly under attorney-client privilege.  \ufffc\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records & Consequences for Non-Compliance\r\n\r\nGiven my ongoing appeal regarding a related FOIL request, I formally demand that all responsive records be preserved while this request and appeal are active.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny destruction, alteration, or deletion of records subject to FOIL review may constitute a violation of state law.\r\n\t\u2022\tSee Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (holding that agencies must preserve all records potentially subject to disclosure).\r\n\t\u2022\tUnder Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(8), willful non-compliance or bad-faith denials could result in judicial intervention and legal penalties.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am prepared to initiate an Article 78 proceeding if necessary to compel compliance with FOIL. Courts have ruled in favor of requesters where agencies engaged in unreasonable delays or improper denials.\r\n\t\u2022\tSee Matter of Thomas v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Educ., 103 A.D.3d 495 (1st Dep\u2019t 2013) (agencies may not improperly delay or refuse to provide access to public records).\r\n\t\u2022\tSee Matter of Madeiros v. New York State Educ. Dept., 30 N.Y.3d 67 (2017) (holding that agencies must provide sufficiently detailed explanations for FOIL denials or risk court intervention).\r\n\r\nIf this FOIL request is improperly denied, I reserve all legal remedies available to enforce compliance, including seeking judicial review under Article 78 and requesting attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in accordance with Matter of Beechwood Restorative Care Ctr. v. Signor, 5 N.Y.3d 435 (2005).\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees associated with this request, as disclosure serves the public interest and is not for commercial use.\r\n\t\u2022\tUnder Matter of New York Times Co. v. City of New York Fire Department, 4 N.Y.3d 477 (2005), fee waivers are appropriate when the requested information enhances public knowledge on government operations.\r\n\t\u2022\tIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $100 for processing fees. Please notify me in advance if costs exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nResponse Format & Timeline\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records in electronic format whenever possible. Under Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3)(a), I expect:\r\n\t1.\tAcknowledgment of receipt within five business days.\r\n\t2.\tAn estimated timeline for completion.\r\n\t3.\tA clear legal explanation for any redactions or denials, citing case law as required under FOIL.\r\n\r\nAll responses should be provided via the MuckRock platform for tracking purposes and CC my personal email at Jordan@Lassiter.eu.\r\n\r\nConclusion & Next Steps\r\n\r\nThis request expands upon my previous FOIL request while reinforcing transparency requirements regarding:\r\n\t1.\tNRPD\u2019s broader engagement with ICE, including written agreements, operational cooperation, and compliance policies.\r\n\t2.\tInternal deliberations regarding FOIL requests concerning ICE, ensuring that FOIL processing procedures are lawful and not influenced by external pressures.\r\n\t3.\tThe integrity of FOIL processing at NRPD, including proper record-keeping, tracking, and certifications of employees responsible for handling public records requests.\r\n\r\nGiven well-established case law supporting disclosure, I expect full compliance with this request. If records are withheld, I demand a detailed legal justification citing specific exemptions and case law.\r\n\r\nIf NRPD fails to comply with its obligations under FOIL, I will consider filing an Article 78 proceeding to compel disclosure, seeking judicial enforcement and attorneys\u2019 fees if necessary.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report",

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nLastly, if you know which police department would also have access to these records please inform us at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKayla Fox\r\nJ.D. Candidate\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nfox.kayl@northeastern.edu\r\n(312) 718-0331\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKayla Fox",
