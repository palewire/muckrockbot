        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll Bureau records that might exist that mention or pertain to my grandfather Jack Hoover Aldrich (born 8-17-1920 - died 4-1-2014). Attached is his obituary. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/127474305/jack-hoover-aldrich\r\n\r\nMy grandfather worked for American Car and Foundry (ACF Industries) in the state of New Mexico in the 1950s. According to my mother's recollection, my grandfather had to undergo a federal background check as his employment involved the transport of nuclear weapon materials by train car by the ACF corporation. My mother recalls federal law enforcement interviewing neighbors and friends in 1956, and then periodic checks afterwards. My grandfather also made repeated trips to the Philippines, where he met Imelda Marcos and other officials in the Philippine government. I am curious as to whether the bureau maintained a file on my grandfather. \r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about my grandfather Jack Hoover Aldrich from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Aldrich held by the Albuquerque Field Office. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Aldrich.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Jack Hoover Aldrich.\r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Jack Hoover Aldrich.\r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
