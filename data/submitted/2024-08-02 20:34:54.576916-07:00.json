Note that this file contains a subset of metadata for 986 emails (of which 232 have attachments) selected from a much larger set of emails sent or received by Council Members or staff with reference to the Secure Scheduling Ordinance. I obtained these metadata in response to a preliminary request (#C169558-020124) which I used to identify the most relevant records for my research. I modified the original metadata file (\"20240320_C169558_Fugiel_metadata_LEG.csv\") by adding an index for the row number, removing empty or uninformative columns, classifying the period when the email was sent (Y1 = 2016, Y2 = 2017), and flagging selected emails (Selected = TRUE). I believe that the modified file contains sufficient information to retrieve the selected emails and attachments. Please let me know if you encounter any difficulty using this file or would prefer for me to merge the selection flag into the full metadata file.\r\n\r\nI am requesting these records for non-commercial research purposes.

Your request was received on August 01, 2024 and is appended below. \r\n \r\nThe reference number for this request is C191956-080124. You will see this number in the title of any communications about this request. \r\n \r\nYou will hear from a Public Disclosure Officer within five business days regarding the status of your request. \r\n \r\nPlease visit the City of Seattle Public Records Request Center where you can manage your profile and access your request. Your login ID is: 170805-47797053@requests.muckrock.com (\r\n \r\nIf a Public Disclosure Officer submitted your public disclosure request into the PRRC on your behalf, please login and complete your new user account by following these steps: \r\n \r\n  * Access the Public Records Request Center \r\n  * Select 'Forgot my Password' \r\n  * Enter your 'Login ID' (email address) \r\n  * A temporary password will be sent to you via email \r\n  * Login with the temporary password \r\nYou may now visit the PRRC 'My Records Request Center' anytime! \r\n \r\nRequest C191956-080124:  \r\n\" To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of all emails and attachments identified in the attached file (\"2024-08-01_C169558_Fugiel-LEG_Seattle-Council-select-metadata.csv\"). Note that this file contains a subset of metadata for 986 emails (of which 232 have attachments) selected from a much larger set of emails sent or received by Council Members or staff with reference to the Secure Scheduling Ordinance. I obtained these metadata in response to a preliminary request (#C169558-020124) which I used to identify the most relevant records for my research. I modified the original metadata file (\"20240320_C169558_Fugiel_metadata_LEG.csv\") by adding an index for the row number, removing empty or uninformative columns, classifying the period when the email was sent (Y1 = 2016, Y2 = 2017), and flagging selected emails (Selected = TRUE). I believe that the modified file contains sufficient information to retrieve the selected emails and attachments. Please let me know if you encounter any difficulty using this file or would prefer for me to merge the selection flag into the full metadata file.\r\n\r\nI am requesting these records for non-commercial research purposes. The records will be made available to the general public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPeter Fugiel\r\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.muckrock.com/outbound_composer_attachments/peter.fugiel/140788/2024-08-01_C169558_Fugiel-LEG_Seattle-Council-select-metadata.csv\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fcity-council-219%252Fselect-secure-scheduling-council-emails-170805%252F%253Femail%253Dmuckrockseattle%252540mycusthelp.net&url_auth_token=AAAbJQToMIQHI1KMRcuzZrve4-c%3A1sZjGp%3AGHU1GXum0pus9tCKOc9CIy8O4-AZfCBLGClic8gMa1s\"",

The custodian will determine whether responsive records exist, and if so, compile the records for your review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the due date located on the individual \"Request #\" page for an estimate of when your records, if any, will be available.\u00a0This estimated due date may be adjusted depending on the nature of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote also that records may be in active use at this time and therefore not available for immediate review.\u00a0Additionally, in accordance with the Louisiana Public Records Law, the City of New Orleans strives to promptly release all records which contain only public information and are not otherwise exempt from the Public Records Law. The City must balance its commitment to open access with its legal obligation to review public records for such exceptions and exemptions prior to release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that there may be a delay in responding to requests for email. Requests for email must first be sent to the City's IT Department to retrieve the requested emails. The emails must then be examined to determine if there is any material that must be redacted for privacy concerns and otherwise. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the custodian notifies our office that the records have been compiled you will be invoiced by email. Once you pay the invoice, you may download the records. Alternatively, you may schedule a time to review or purchase copies of the records.\u00a0Thank you for your request, and we look forward to working with you to provide public records in a fair and efficient manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nCity of New Orleans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\nReply to this email or sign in to contact City of New Orleans.<br><br>\r\n             <a href=\"https://nola.nextrequest.com/settings?id=1523524\">Change your email settings</a> | <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">Visit our help center</a>",
