Please see the linked final response from ICE to our prior request for these forms from ICE. https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23994964-foia-appeal-adjudication-letter-2023-icap-00450-2023-icfo-26205-affirm-search\r\n\r\nWe note that ICE initially denied our FOIA request on the ground that it has no records because DCRA does not apply to the agency. On appeal, IC admits the applicability of DCRA, but claims the agency fills out the form online and doesn\u2019t keep a copy. Accordingly, we are requesting copies from DOJ BJP. \r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt and complete response to this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

We received your request on September 28, 2023.  Your\r\nrequest states:\r\n\r\n*Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\nrecords: All military service records for Mark Keith Robinson, DOB: August\r\n18, 1968, including but not limited to discharge paperwork, training logs,\r\nand service awards.*\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of your inquiry, we are forwarding your request by this\r\nemail to the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) for Military Records\r\nin St. Louis for appropriate handling.  The NPRC will assign your request a\r\ntracking number and respond directly to you.  In the future, if you need to\r\ncontact the NPRC, you can do so by mail or fax to the following address:\r\n\r\nNational Personnel Records Center\r\n1 Archives Drive\r\nSt. Louis, Missouri 63138\r\n\r\nTelephone:   314-801-0800\r\nTelephone (Toll Free):  1-866-272-6272 (only within the US)\r\nFax:  314-801-9195\r\n\r\nFor your reference, below you will find your original submission.\r\n\r\nOn our website at https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records\r\nyou can find information about requesting Official Military Personnel Files\r\n(OMPFs) that are not yet archival records fully open to the public.  At the\r\nwebsite for the National Archives at St. Louis,\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/st-louis/ <https://www.archives.gov/st-louis/%20>,\r\nyou will find information about requesting Official Military Personnel\r\nFiles that are now archival records open to the public.  The OMPF normally\r\nbecomes an archival record 62 years after the date of discharge.\r\n\r\nAt www.archives.gov/foia <http://www.archives.gov/foia%20> we provide\r\ninformation about FOIA.  On our home page, www.archives.gov, you can learn\r\nabout the resources that we offer to the public, and access our online\r\ncatalog.\r\n\r\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, and pursuant to guidance received from the\r\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB), NARA had adjusted its normal\r\noperations to balance the need of completing its mission-critical work\r\nwhile also adhering to the recommended social distancing for the safety of\r\nour staff.  NPRC is working with a reduced on site staff who are\r\nprioritizing veterans' burial requests, homeless veterans, and medical\r\nemergency requests.  As a result of this re-prioritization of activities,\r\nyou may experience a delay in receiving a substantive response to your FOIA\r\nrequest.  We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your\r\nunderstanding and patience.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAshley Bryan\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nOffice of General Counsel (NGC)\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road\r\nCollege Park, Maryland, 20740-6001\r\n301-837-3642\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\r\nFrom: <152552-85444271@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nDate: Thu, Sep 28, 2023 at 1:13\u202fPM\r\nSubject: Freedom of Information Act Request: Mark Keith Robinson service\r\nrecords\r\nTo: NARA General Counsel FOIA Office <foia@nara.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNat'l Archives & Records Admin\r\nFOIA Office\r\nRoom 3110\r\n8601 Adelphi Road\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740\r\n\r\nSeptember 28, 2023\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\nrecords:\r\n\r\nAll military service records for Mark Keith Robinson, DOB: August 18, 1968,\r\nincluding but not limited to discharge paperwork, training logs, and\r\nservice awards.\r\n\r\nI would ask that all documents be released on a rolling basis as they\r\nbecome available.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation\r\nfor the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s)\r\nupon which you rely.\r\n\r\nAlso, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\nthis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform\r\nme of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
