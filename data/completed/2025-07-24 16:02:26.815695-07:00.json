The relevant section is found on the last page, under \"Assurance of Compliance\". The SPPO requested the documentation be submitted no later than April 30, 2025. If the Tennessee Department of Education sent communications to the SPPO requesting an extension or declining to submit the documentation, I request a copy of said communications.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKent Hoover, a citizen of Tennessee, in coordination with Ileana Garnand.",

Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The public interest outweighs the \r\n https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/2014/s200872.html \r\n\r\nFurthermore, SB1421 requires the department to release records related to police shootings. They are exempt from permanent disclosure as an investigatory record. There is no right to privacy in cases of officer shootings. \r\nhttps://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1421\r\n\r\nUpon invoking this post-60-day delay, and at subsequent 180-day intervals for each subsequent delay, the Departments must provide in writing to the requester, the specific basis for the Departments' determination that it has reason to believe that disclosure will interfere with the criminal investigation of the officer who engaged in misconduct or used force, or of someone other than the officer who used force. In addition, this writing must include the estimated date for disclosure of the withheld information. In any event, the Departments must provide the information when the specific basis for withholding is resolved, the investigation or proceeding is no longer active, and in no case later than 18 months following the use of force incident, whichever occurs sooner. Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 832.7(b)(8)(A)(ii).\r\n\r\nAt most, you have 18 months since July 4th, 2024, to delay the release.

        "communication": "To:  189423-07971816@requests.muckrock.com\r\nHi, you asked me for Brady lists and \u201cany and all records regarding substantiated allegations of misconduct or violations of internal department policy or criminal law by specific law enforcement officers.\u201d\r\nI already responded that Wahkiakum County has no Brady list.  I now attach all records the sheriff\u2019s office can find regarding substantiated allegations of misconduct or violations.  (Neither of the deputies concerned are working for the sheriff\u2019s office and therefore neither are on my Brady list.)  The incidents occurred long ago and now fall outside the retention schedule set for us by the Washington State Archives, which means they could have been destroyed, but some materials were discovered and I reproduce them for you here.  The first documents ending 3050 and 3060, concern Josh Grasseth, who came back to town after a stint working for the S\u2019Kallam tribal police and then a few years in the private sector and who is now running for sheriff.  The rest regard Bill Tawater, who retired and is now a pillar of the local American Legion post.\r\nI believe this is all we have, but since these documents were found in places other than the likely places such documents would be found, we will keep looking and turn over to you anything responsive that we find.  In the expectation that we will not find anything, and for the purposes of establishing a legal statute of limitations, however, I am closing this request as of today.  If you object or have further questions, please contact me.\r\nAmong the papers we found is one relevant page I am not sending on.  It is a 2016 email from me that contains legal advice relevant to your request, and it is privileged and exempt from the Public Records Act.  The privilege is established by RCW 5.60.060(2)(a), which is an \"other statute\" that exempts or prohibits disclosure pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(1).\r\nThank you for your inquiry.  Please get back in touch if you have any questions or would like to make another request.  Have a great day!\n",

        "communication": "Thank you for your patience, the documents have been sent via MOVEit, they are available to download for 35 days.  Please note that all identifying information relating to the complainant and any witnesses has been redacted, as that information is exempt from disclosure pursuant to M.G.L. c.4, \u00a77(26)(a) and (f).  Commonly known as the statutory exemption, M.G.L. c.4, \u00a77(26) (a) applies to records that are specifically or by necessary implication exempted from disclosure by statute.  M.G.L. c.93H, relating to the security of personal information, defines personal information as a residents name in combination with a financial account number and requires agencies to safeguard personal information.  Consumer complaint files contain individuals names associated with their insurance policy numbers, thus they contain personal information as defined by M.G.L. c.93H.  The Division of Insurance is required by this statute to maintain the confidentiality of personal information.   In addition, the names of the complainants have been redacted in order to maintain the confidentiality of their identity pursuant to M.G.L. c.4, \u00a77(26) (f), commonly known as the investigatory exemption.  This exemption is intended to allow investigative officials to provide an assurance of confidentiality to individuals so they will speak openly about matters under investigation.  Bougas v. Chief of Police, 371 Mass 59, 62 (1976).\r\n\r\nPursuant to M. G.L. c.66, \u00a710A(a), you may appeal this response to the Supervisor of Public Records following the procedures set forth in 950 CMR 32.08, a copy of which is available at  http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/lawlib/900-999cmr/950cmr32.pdf.  You may also file a civil action in accordance with M.G.L. c.66, \u00a710A(c).\r\n\r\nMindy A. Merow Rubin\r\nCounsel to the Commissioner and\r\nRecords Access Officer\r\nMassachusetts Division of Insurance\r\ndoi.rao@mass.gov",

The possible return date of July 31, 2025 -- and the lack of an explanation \u2013 is unreasonable, given the narrow scope of the request, originally submitted March 10.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, the executive chamber is required by law to provide specific reasons within 10 business days explaining why this request cannot be filled, or else, must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by the specific date given beyond twenty business days, or if the specific date given is unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied (see \u00a789[4][a]). In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d\r\n\r\nI, on behalf of New York Focus, am requesting either you fill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial, as required by law, of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJulia Rock\r\nNew York Focus",

The possible return date of July 31, 2025 -- and the lack of an explanation \u2013 is unreasonable, given the narrow scope of the request, originally submitted March 10.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, the executive chamber is required by law to provide specific reasons within 10 business days explaining why this request cannot be filled, or else, must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by the specific date given beyond twenty business days, or if the specific date given is unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied (see \u00a789[4][a]). In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d\r\n\r\nI, on behalf of New York Focus, am requesting either you fill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial, as required by law, of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJulia Rock\r\nNew York Focus",

        "communication": "FDA FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of the Executive Secretariat\r\nUS Food Administration\r\n5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1050\r\n\r\nRe: APPEAL - Freedom of Information Act\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal under the Freedom of Information Act regarding FDA FOIA Control #: 2022-98.\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 28, 2021, I requested records under the Freedom of Information Act from the FDA pertaining to \"All emails that include and/or contain the word 'embargo' that were sent to, from, and/or between specific email addresses between the dates of 3/1/2020 and the date this request is ultimately processed, including their attachments.\" I also provided a specific list of email addresses belonging to officials at the FDA.\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 29, 2021, I received confirmation from the FDA that my request had been received and was provided with reference number FDA2179960.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 4, 2022, I received an acknowledgement letter from director Sarah Kotler letting me know that the agency would respond to my request with a determination and let me know about fees, and informing me that the agency needed an extra 10 days to respond.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 5, 2022, Sarah Kotler contacted me asking to speak with me by phone about my request.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 6, 2022, I called the number Ms. Kotler had provided to me but was unable to reach her.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 7, 2022, I finally spoke with Ms. Kotler by phone. She recommended that I narrow my search parameters down to the following to speed up the process of retrieving the requested information: \"All emails that include and/or contain the word 'embargo' that were sent to, from, and/or between the following email addresses between the dates of 3/1/2020 and the date this request is ultimately processed: heidi.Rebello@fda.hhs.gov ; michael.felberbaum@fda.hhs.gov.\" \r\n\r\nI agreed to Ms. Kotler's recommendation to narrow the request to the above parameters by phone, and then sent a follow-up email immediately following our conversation confirming the same.\r\n\r\nAfter my phone conversation with Ms. Kotler, my email address was suddenly classified as spam by the FDA. Because of that, my follow-up emails would not go through to Ms. Kotler. Instead, a traditional letter was sent by mail, which Ms. Kotler confirmed receipt of in an email sent to me on 1/25/2022.\r\n\r\nIt is now June 28, 2022 and I still have not received a determination letter for my request. I assume the request was approved, because Ms. Kotler sent an email response to my follow-up questions on 3/28/2022 and 4/27/2022 letting me know the agency was preparing a significant volume of records. However, I was never provided with a determination letter letting me know whether my request was approved or denied, or informing me of my fee status as a media requester.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am aware, the FDA is required by the FOIA to provide me with a determination about my request status and my fee status within 30 days of my request, both of which I still have not received over six months later.\r\n\r\nI have attached copies of the only two letters I've received from Ms. Kotler regarding FDA FOIA Control #: 2022-98.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions while handling this appeal, you can contact me at the email address listed below. I would prefer that all communications related to this appeal be in writing if possible, so I am not providing a phone number.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Miller\r\n122415-50044888@requests.muckrock.com\r\nMuckRock News DEPT MR 122415 411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville MA 02144-2516 US",

        "communication": "Hi Christa,\r\n\r\nThank you for following up about FOI Request FOI# 2022-98. I am still very interested in receiving the records I requested from your agency via that FOIA request.\r\n\r\nAs far as your question asking for \"a topic\" related to the records I am seeking, please refer to this article in Scientific American: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-fda-manipulates-the-media\r\n\r\nAs far as your question about specific keywords to search for, please follow the instructions in my original request and simply search for the term \"embargo.\" You may also include \"embargoes\" and \"embargoed,\" in addition to \"embargo,\" if you think it might turn up additional records (although, presumably, a search for \"embargo\" should automatically include those additional terms).\r\n\r\nFinally, as a reminder, I submitted this FOIA request to your agency on Dec. 28, 2021. It is now January 25, 2025. In over four years, your agency still has not provided me with the responsive records for this request. \r\n\r\nGiven the extraordinary amount of time that has lapsed between the submission of my FOIA request and today's date, I believe it is appropriate to remind your agency of its duty to transparency under the FOIA, including your duty to make public records \"promptly available\" to requesters after a determination has been issued by your agency (which typically occurs within 20 days of the initial request, per  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)).\r\n\r\nOn 2/24/2022, Sarah B. Kotler emailed me about this request, stating: \"The assigned office is currently searching for responsive records.\" On 3/28/2022, Sarah B. Kotler followed up again, stating: \"We are in the process of collecting records for this request.\" \r\n\r\nIt has been almost three years since Ms. Kotler emailed me those updates about my FOIA request.\r\n\r\nPer  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(i), agencies must provide requested records \"promptly\" after issuing a determination: \"Any person making a request to any agency for records under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to such request if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions of this paragraph. If the Government can show exceptional circumstances exist and that the agency is exercising due diligence in responding to the request, the court may retain jurisdiction and allow the agency additional time to complete its review of the records. Upon any determination by an agency to comply with a request for records, the records shall be made promptly available to such person making such request. Any notification of denial of any request for records under this subsection shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial of such request.\"\r\n\r\nEven in cases of supposed \"extraordinary circumstances,\" the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit Court has already addressed the problem of unusually long delays in making public records available to requesters. In Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 711 F.3d 180, 188 (D.C. Cir. 2013), the Court stated: \r\n\r\n\"Second, the statute requires that the agency immediately notify the requester of the right 'to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination.- Id. The requirement that the agency notify the requester about administrative appeal rights further indicates that the \u201cdetermination\u201d must be substantive, not just a statement of a future intent to produce non-exempt responsive documents. Otherwise, this right of administrative appeal would make little sense because there would be nothing to appeal at the time the agency makes its supposed 'determination' in response to a properly filed FOIA request.\r\n\r\n\"This critical point both highlights and unravels the maneuver that the FEC (backed by the Department of Justice) is attempting here. Under the FEC's theory, an agency could respond to a request within 20 working days in terms not susceptible to immediate administrative appeal\u2014by simply stating, in essence, that it will produce documents and claim exemptions over withheld documents in the future. Then, the agency could process the request at its leisure, free from any timelines. All the while, the agency's actions would remain immune from suit because the requester would not yet have been able to appeal and exhaust administrative appeal remedies. Therein lies the Catch\u201322 that the agency seeks to jam into FOIA: A requester cannot appeal within the agency because the agency has not provided the necessary information. Yet the requester cannot go to court because the requester has not appealed within the agency. Although the agency may desire to keep FOIA requests bottled up in limbo for months or years on end, the statute simply does not countenance such a system, as we read the statutory text.\" (Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 711 F.3d 180, 186-87 (D.C. Cir. 2013))\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind the laws and court rulings cited above, it is unacceptable that I have waited over four years to receive the requested records under this FOIA request.\r\n\r\nThat said, please be aware that if I have not received all of the requested records pertaining to this request by 1/31/2025, I will have no choice but to seek dispute resolution from the OGIS, per my rights as a requester under the federal FOIA. Should that happen, considering the amount of time that has lapsed between my original request, and the fact that there is a six-year statute of limitations for filing FOIA lawsuits against the federal government, there is also a strong chance that I will begin to seek legal counsel regarding this request at the same time.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me in writing at this email address if you have any further questions. I do not wish to be contacted by phone, as I am now requesting that all further communications be in writing moving forward, so that I may have legal documentation to provide to OGIS and possibly an attorney.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Marie Miller",

Humphrey Building, Room 729H\r\n200 Independence Avenue, SW\r\nWashington, D.C. 20201\r\n\r\nAPPEAL: FOIA Request - FDA FOIA Control #2022-98\r\n\r\nMarch 12, 2025\r\n\r\nDear Paula Formoso,\r\n\r\nI am writing to submit an appeal for a FOIA request that I submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 8, 2021, which sought records of emails containing the word \u201cembargo\u201d that were sent to, from, and/or between a set of specific email addresses belonging to specific officials at FDA and HHS between the dates of March 1, 2020, and the date the FOIA request was ultimately processed. \r\n\r\nMy request (FDA FOIA Control #2022-98) was acknowledged by Sarah B. Kotler, Director of the FDA Division of Freedom of Information, on January 4, 2022. Part of the responsive records related to my request were apparently referred to HHS for review in December 2023, but were never provided to me.\r\n\r\nYou can review my original request and my communications with the FDA\u2019s FOIA office staff about this request on the MuckRock website (an online FOIA requester service and public database through which my request was filed), where you can also review scans of the FDA\u2019s acknowledgement letters and the partial records related to my request: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/emails-mentioning-embargo-2020-2021-fda-office-of-media-affairs-122415/ \r\n\r\nTo my knowledge, none of the acknowledgement letters I received related to this FOIA request provided a deadline for appeal. To date, the request has not been completed by HHS or FDA, and because of HHS and FDA\u2019s unusually long delays in providing the requested records, I am appealing both agencies' responses to this request, which I believe violate the FOIA in spirit and letter.\r\n\r\nOn December 28, 2023 (over a year after my request was submitted), I received a small batch of records related to my request. In an email to me on the same date, Ms. Kotler explained the partial delivery of records and informed me that additional records would be released to me the following month (January 2024). Ms. Kotler also informed me in that email about other records related to my request that had been referred to HHS and told me those records would be made available to me after review by your agency. You can view Ms. Kotler\u2019s email at the MuckRock link above, under the \u201cCommunications\u201d tab.\r\n\r\nAs of today\u2019s date, March 12, 2025, I have not received any more documents related to my FOIA request beyond the partial delivery in December 2023, described above, despite Sarah Kotler\u2019s assurances that more records would be provided to me.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear to me whether the remainder of my request will ever be completed, as it has been over three years since I originally submitted this request to the FDA, and it has been over a year since the agency last produced a small portion of the requested records and referred additional records to HHS for review. As a result of the unusually lengthy delay in the production of the requested records by both agencies, I am submitting this appeal to both agencies' public liaisons for review.\r\n\r\nPer 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(i), agencies must provide requested records \"promptly\" after issuing a determination: \"Any person making a request to any agency for records under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to such request if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions of this paragraph. If the Government can show exceptional circumstances exist and that the agency is exercising due diligence in responding to the request, the court may retain jurisdiction and allow the agency additional time to complete its review of the records. Upon any determination by an agency to comply with a request for records, the records shall be made promptly available to such person making such request. Any notification of denial of any request for records under this subsection shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial of such request.\"\r\n\r\nEven in cases of supposed \"extraordinary circumstances,\" the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit Court has already addressed the problem of unusually long delays in making public records available to requesters, which also addressed the strategic tactic of failing to deliver documents timely in order to prevent requesters from appealing or seeking recourse in federal court. In Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 711 F.3d 180, 188 (D.C. Cir. 2013), the Court stated:\r\n\r\n\"Second, the statute requires that the agency immediately notify the requester of the right 'to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination.- Id. The requirement that the agency notify the requester about administrative appeal rights further indicates that the \u201cdetermination\u201d must be substantive, not just a statement of a future intent to produce non-exempt responsive documents. Otherwise, this right of administrative appeal would make little sense because there would be nothing to appeal at the time the agency makes its supposed 'determination' in response to a properly filed FOIA request.\r\n\r\n\"This critical point both highlights and unravels the maneuver that the FEC (backed by the Department of Justice) is attempting here. Under the FEC's theory, an agency could respond to a request within 20 working days in terms not susceptible to immediate administrative appeal\u2014by simply stating, in essence, that it will produce documents and claim exemptions over withheld documents in the future. Then, the agency could process the request at its leisure, free from any timelines. All the while, the agency's actions would remain immune from suit because the requester would not yet have been able to appeal and exhaust administrative appeal remedies. Therein lies the Catch\u201322 that the agency seeks to jam into FOIA: A requester cannot appeal within the agency because the agency has not provided the necessary information. Yet the requester cannot go to court because the requester has not appealed within the agency. Although the agency may desire to keep FOIA requests bottled up in limbo for months or years on end, the statute simply does not countenance such a system, as we read the statutory text.\" Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 711 F.3d 180, 186-87 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\n\r\nLater in the decision, the Court went on to state: \u201cPut simply, the unusual circumstances provision to extend the time for making a 'determination' makes sense only if the statute contemplates that responsive documents must be collected and examined, and decisions made about which to produce, in order for the agency to make a 'determination.'\u201d Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 711 F.3d 180, 188 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\n\r\nBecause my request includes records that should have been reviewed and provided to me by both FDA and HHS over a year ago, I believe appealing to both agencies is appropriate here. Bearing in mind the FOIA and court rulings cited above, it is unacceptable that I have waited over three years for the completion of a straightforward FOIA request.\r\n\r\nPlease consider my appeal and let me know whether I should redirect my complaints about this FOIA request to the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Miller",
