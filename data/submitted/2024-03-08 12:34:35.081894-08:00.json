Any communications with Sodexo regarding the lawsuit or Roger Guarino's status at MCC.\r\n2.) Any communications between MCC and Roger Guarino regarding the lawsuit or any steps taken by MCC in response to the lawsuit.\r\n3.)  Any communications with any other educational institution regarding Roger Guarino, including any communications with the University of Arkansas - Little Rock, where Sodexo reassigned Roger Guarino to another position that involved interacting with children despite being aware of the child molestation lawsuit.\r\n\r\n## Affiliated entities\r\n\r\nMy request includes any records that may in the custody of the Monroe Community College Foundation, a non-profit associated MCC. Such records constitute \"material received by a corporation providing services for a State university and kept on behalf of the university\" (Encore Coll v. Auxiliary Serv NY Court of Appeals (1995) 87 N.Y.2d 410,414) and are thus \"a record subject to disclosure under FOIL\" (id.). \r\n\r\n## Fees\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees in excess of $200, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests take longer than a month to complete.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public.\u00a0 You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

Please use the following unique FOIA tracking number CBP-FO-2024-070821 to track the status of your request. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations. By submitting your request, you have agreed to pay up to $25.00 in applicable processing fees, if any fees associated with your request exceed this amount, CBP shall contact you; however, the first 100 pages are free. \r\nConsistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, CBP processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.  Although CBP\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). Please note that due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, and a current backlog, it may take 6-9 months to receive a response to your FOIA request. We are diligently working to process each request as quickly as possible, in the order they were received. We appreciate your patience during this time. \r\n \r\nFor additional information please consult CBP FOIA website please click on FOIA Act Resources or visit http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.
