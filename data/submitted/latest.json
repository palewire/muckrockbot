Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at sam.levin@theguardian.com or 646-935-9115. \r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSam Levin",

She had been abducted near her bus stop in Englewood, Colorado the night prior and she had also been sexually assaulted. In 2019, James Curtis Clanton was arrested for Helene\u2019s murder, and he was sentenced to life in prison in 2020.

I am looking for records reflecting the number of cases psychics or hypnosis has been used by the department since the year 2000. \r\n\r\nAfter speaking to the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the agency determined it had no records indicating the number of cases psychics or hypnosis had been used.  The agency told me that The Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was handling the Helene Pruszynski murder investigation at the time, so the CBI is the custodian of any contracting records and investigatory records produced by the forensic psychic or the hypnosis in that particular case. \r\n\r\nTo that end I am looking I am looking for any records including contracting records as well as any investigatory records produced by any forensic psychic or hypnotist during the course of any investigation CBI used their services. I am also looking for records reflecting the number of cases psychics or hypnosis has been used by CBI since the year 2000.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Video from the Otay Mesa Detention Center (OMDC) from March 1, 2023 - March 5, 2023, showing Cristian Dumitrascu, who died on March 5, 2023. \r\nSee: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrCristianDumitrascu.pdf. The primary custodian of this record is CoreCivic, which operates OMDC for ICE pursuant to a subcontract with the US Marshalls (CONT_IDV_70CDCR20D00000007_7012). \r\nCustodian(s) to task: \r\nUnder the ICE contract, CoreCivic is required to secure and preserve video of this type. The secondary custodian of this record is the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility's (OPR) External Reviews and Analysis Unit (ERAU), which maintains a SharePoint drive containing this video in association with its review of Mr. Dumitrascu's death and the associated report. The tertiary custodian is the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) San Diego Field Office, which may have facilitated the transfer of the video to ERAU death reviewers in March or April of 2023. \r\n\r\n2. Mr. Dumitrascu's ICE medical records. \r\nCustodian(s) to task: \r\nThese medical records are created and maintained by CoreCivic personnel at OMDC under the supervision of ICE ERO - IHSC Field Medical personnel. They will be in the possession of both OPR-ERAU in the aforementioned SharePoint drive and IHSC's Mortality Review Committee.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nI make this request as a researcher with the Mami Chelo Foundation. https://mamichelo.org/. The Foundation holds Power of Attorney for Mr. Dumitrascu's family in Europe and are prepared to supply appropriate documentation upon request.  Headquartered in New York, New York (70 W 36th Street, Suite 12A, New York, NY 10018) Mami Chelo are gathering records from US-based agencies on his family's behalf and preparing a public-facing report regarding the circumstances surrounding his death.  I further make this request as an independent journalist working together with Mami Chelo to gather and disseminate information to the public and stakeholders regarding Mr. Dumitrascu's death. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nMami Chelo requests expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e). In support of expedited processing, I make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n1. ICE's only public-facing explanation of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Dumitrascu's death appears in its Detainee Death Report (DDR): https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrCristianDumitrascu.pdf. \r\n2. The DDR does not identify a cause or manner of death for Mr. Dumitrascu.\r\n3. ICE has never revealed to Mr. Dumitrascu's family or the public any additional information it may have regarding how or why he died. \r\n4. The timeline ICE provided in its DDR does not match other records Mami Chelo has obtained. First, a 911 / CAD record indicates CoreCivic / ICE personnel did not call 911 for emergency medical treatment or notify authorities of Mr. Dumitrascu's death until 3:25 a.m. on May 5, 2023, despite the fact that ICE says a physician in La Mesa, California instructed paramedics to cease life-saving efforts and pronounced Dumitrascu deceased at 1:02 a.m. https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24788176-dumitrascu-911-record-s001426-042424_e8392573_030523_mb2168_redacted-1\r\n5. The timeline ICE provided DHS-CRCL regarding when ALS efforts began appears to differ from the publicly available timeline in ICE's DDR, indicating a potential delay in care of at least five minutes: https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24695164/2024-crfo-00207-crcl-records.pdf. \r\n6. These discrepancies, combined by the fact that CoreCivic personnel did not call 911 or promptly notify San Diego County Sheriff's Office personnel or the Medical Examiner of Mr. Dumitrascu's death, raise possible questions regarding the integrity of the government's reports and that of it contractor in relation to this death. See 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(iv). \r\n7. Raising additional questions regarding the government's integrity, Mami Chelo collected 8 statements from witnesses at OMDC who saw Mr. Dumitrascu on the morning he died, or were housed with him prior to his death. These witnesses reported CoreCivic shutting off facility phones, and CoreCivic and ICE abruptly transferring or deporting witnesses before they could be interviewed by government investigators. Several also reported a delay in emergency medical care by CoreCivic staff. \r\n8. A recent report by the American Civil Liberties Union, Physicians for Human Rights, and American Oversight revealed that ICE's own internal investigators documented a 50-minute delay in the arrival of emergency care during the previous death at Otay Mesa Detention Center -- that of Nebane Abienwi -- \"because the on-call medical provider at the detention facility did not respond to a nurse's request for authorization to call an ambulance.\" https://phr.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/REPORT-ICE-Deadly-Failures-ACLU-PHR-AO-2024.pdf. It appears no ambulance was ever called for Mr. Dumitrascu. \r\n9. Deaths in ICE custody -- and particularly deaths in the custody of CoreCivic, one of ICE's largest detention contractors -- have been the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest.

More than 14,000 pages of government records reviewed by medical experts showed nearly all deaths in ICE custody could have been prevented, and ICE failed to properly investigate or punish contractors and medical providers for delays in care that caused people in custody to die. https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/\r\n11. A wrongful termination lawsuit filed against CoreCivic in February 2024 alleges the company was dangerously understaffed in the medical department during the period in which Mr. Dumitrascu died, leading to medical neglect: https://www.kpbs.org/news/border-immigration/2024/04/16/lawsuit-against-ice-detention-center-highlights-medical-neglect-complaints. \r\n12. According to DHS's FY 2023 FOIA report, ICE has reduced the number of FOIA processing personnel to its lowest levels since FY 2017 - just 47 total personnel, down from 60.5 in FY22. The agency reduced spending on FOIA processing by more than a million dollars - from $8.2M in FY22 to $7.2M in FY23. The agency's portion of DHS's total FOIA spending went from 11.4% in FY22 to 8.7% in FY23, despite the fact that the agency received 20,000 more requests than the previous fiscal year. Consequently, ICE's backlog more the doubled from 13k at the end of FY22 to 32k at the end of FY23. https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/23_0325_fy23-FOIA_Annual_Report.pdf. Without expedited processing, Mami Chelo, Mr. Dumitrascu's family, and the public will likely wait years for a response to the very simply questions these records could answer about how and why he died.\r\n13. There is an urgent need to inform the public and Mr. Dumitrascu's family of the truth about how and why he died at OMDC, and whether other currently detained individuals are at risk of meeting a similar fate as Congress increases detention bed funding. The requested records are among the most reliable and compelling primary source documents available to do so. \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Mami Chelo respectfully requests expedited processing of this FOIA request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

The term \u201cdocument\u201d includes both the principal document responsive to the request as well as any studies, exhibits, supporting documentation or supplement thereof.\r\nAs you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nRequest for expedited processing\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 12,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 832-247-3046. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAna L. Toledo, Esq.\t\r\nTargeted Justice, Inc.\r\nP.O. Box 15990\r\nHouston, TX  77220\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice",
