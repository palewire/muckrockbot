Any policies or procedures that dictate what educational and programmatic services are offered to Federal Detainees and ICE Detainees within Plymouth Sheriff\u2019s custody.\r\n\r\n2. Records that indicate what educational services (including but not limited to K-12 education, Special Education, Vocational Education, High School Equivalency, or post-secondary education), if any, were provided to federal detainees and ICE detainees  from January 2021 through the date that this request is responded to. We request records that show the age of the detainee who received educational services, and the type of educational services provided. If no educational services were provided during this time, a statement to that effect would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Public Records law requires you to provide me with a written response within 10 business days.
