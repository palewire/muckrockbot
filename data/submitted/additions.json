Specifically, I am requesting monthly counts of court-ordered competency evaluations by court, if such data is available. If monthly counts are not available, then annual counts for each court are acceptable. I would like this data for as far back as the Office of the Executive Secretary has it available. If this data can be separated into just competency evaluations vs combination competency and sanity at the time of offense evaluations, then I would ask that these counts go in separate columns.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
