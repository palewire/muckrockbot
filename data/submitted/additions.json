Ancestry.com is currently the only available source for the 1910 birth index, however, the quality of scans they received from The Vitalsearch Company are incredibly low quality and their transcribed database suffers because of how illegible it is.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCorrine DeCiampa",
