The child was taken to Scotland and the father had no contact for over 12 months. \r\n\r\nThis incident appears to have involved violations of federal law under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204 among other crimes.\r\n\r\nFee waiver requested under victim rights, public accountability standards, and exercise of civil rights.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by 1 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 408(6). The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Incident reports and case records refer to reports produced with notes and narratives, a description of what happened by the responding officer, trace reports, case notes and litigation files\r\n- All unedited body-worn camera / bodycam recordings. I am specifically requesting the unedited body-worn camera recordings captured by all officers present for the full duration of the incident, including audio recordings associated with the footage. If any portion of the requested footage must be redacted, I ask that you clearly indicate the portions that have been redacted and provide an explanation of the legal basis for the redactions\r\n- All 911 or calls for service logs, audio and transcripts\r\n- All computer aided dispatch (CAD) reports and a copy of your department\u2019s dispatch 10 signals/codes, agency dispatch signals/codes and CAD signals/codes\r\n\r\nI request these records in their native digital formats and not in formats that degrade the accessibility of the records, such as tabular data converted to PDF or Word files. If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files). Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, I additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nProduction of Responsive Records on a Rolling Basis: In the event that a portion of the present request is completed before the full request is completed, I ask that the records be produced on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nRequest for Explanation of Withholdings and Redactions: If this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide a reasonable description of any withheld materials and a justification for all such withholdings that includes reference to the specific exemptions authorizing withholding and specific reasons why such exemptions apply.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDillon Bergin\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fsan-francisco-police-department-367%252Fbrandon-carrillo-interaction-reports-190926%252F%253Femail%253Dsanfranciscopd%252540govqa.us&url_auth_token=AAAIhlqz_6HzFpF9QbtVNXCgHbA%3A1ulJ0V%3AZ8DZlXkA1tCiNM0RwW3vM8_bXwhDY1MJANRnJdTDx3M \r\n \r\nYour request is being forwarded to the appropriate department(s) for processing and you will be notified once the request is complete. \r\n \r\nYou can monitor request progress at the link below. \u00a0Thank you for using the San Francisco Public Records Center. \r\n \r\n \r\nSan Francisco Police Department",
