As such, though certain pages may have been previously released to me, the existence of those pages within new context renders them functionally new pages. As such, the only way to properly analyze released information is to analyze that information with its proper context. Therefore, I request disclosure of all \u201cduplicate\u201d pages. \r\n7.\tRequest to Search Emails \u2013 Please search for emails relating to the subject matter of my request.\r\n8.\tRequest for Search of Records Transferred to Other Agencies \u2013 I request that in conducting its search, Department of Treasury , disclose releasable records even if they are available publicly through other sources outside of the organization. \r\n9.\tRegarding Destroyed Records \u2013 If any records responsive or potentially responsive to my request have been destroyed, my request includes but is not limited to any and all records relating or referring to the destruction of those records. This includes, but is not limited to, any and all records relating or referring to the events leading to the destruction of those records. \r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS REGARDING SCOPE AND BREADTH OF REQUESTS\r\n\r\nPlease interpret the scope of this request broadly. Department of Treasury  is instructed to interpret the scope of this request in the most liberal manner possible short of any interpretation that would lend to a conclusion that the request does not reasonably describe the records sought. \r\n\r\nEXEMPTIONS AND SEGREBALITY\r\n\r\nI call your attention to President Obama\u2019s 21 January 2009 Memorandum concerning the Freedom of Information Act in which he states:\r\n\r\n\u201cAll agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA\u2026The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA. \r\n\r\nIn the same Memorandum, President Obama added that government information should not be kept confidential \u201cmerely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because of errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears.\u201d\r\n\r\nFinally, President Obama ordered that \u201cThe Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear presumption: In the case of doubt, openness prevails\u201d\r\n\r\nNonetheless, if any responsive record or portion thereof is claimed to be exempt from production, FOIA statues provide that even if some of the requested material is properly exempt from mandatory disclosure, all segregable portions must be released. If documents are denied in part or in whole, please specify which exemption(s) is (are) claimed for each passage or whole document denied. Please provide a complete itemized inventory and a detailed factual justification of total or partial denial of documents. Specify the number of pages in each document and the toal number of pages pertaining to this request. For \u201cclassified\u201d material denied, please include the following information: the classification (confidential., secret or top secret); identity of the classifier; date or event for automatic declassification or classification review or downgrading; if applicable, identity of official authorizing extension of automatic declassification or review past six years; and, if applicable, the reason for extended classification beyond six years.\r\n\r\nIn excising material, please \u201cblack out\u201d the material rather than \u201cWhite out\u201d or \u201ccut out.\u201d I expect, as provided by FOIA, that the remaining non-exempt portions of documents will be released. Please release all pages regardless of the extent of excising, even if all that remains are stationary headings or administrative markings. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I ask that your agency exercise its discretion to release records which may be technically exempt, but where withholdings serve no important public interest. \r\n\r\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING REQUEST\r\n\r\nPlease produce all records with administrative markings and pagination included. Please send a memo (copy to me) to the appropriate units in your office to assure that no record related to this requests are destroyed. Please advise of any destruction of records and include the data of the authority of such destruction. \r\n\r\nFORMAT \r\n\r\nI request that any release stemming from this request be provided to me in digital format (soft copy) via email, or via USB DRIVE, COMPACT DISK, or other like media. \r\n\r\nFEE CATEGORY AND REQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI am an investigative journalist who has written for major media including Business Insider, Time, Fortune, and The Nation Magazine. I am willing to pay any reasonable expenses associated with this request, however, as the purpose of the request is disclosure in full conformity with the statutory requirements for a waiver of fees, I formally request such a waiver. I request a waiver of all costs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). \r\n\r\nShould my request for a fee waiver be denied, I request that I be categorized as a member of the news media for free purposes. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTekendra Parmar",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to Louis de Wohl, aka Ludwig von Wohl, aka Theodor Gaspar Adolf Wohl (January 24, 1903 - June 2, 1961). Mr. De Wohl was a German-born but Hungarian-raised astrologer who emigrated to Great Britain in 1935. A few years later, in 1941, Mr. De Wohl was sent to the United States by the Special Operations Executive, a British intelligence service, to convince Americans that the United States should join World War II, and while there, his tour was overseen by the British Security Coordination (BSC), a separate British intelligence service based out of New York City. The FBI and the BSC worked closely during this period, sharing intelligence on potential security threats, such as the 1939 \"Joe K\" spy ring out of Bermuda which was controlled by German spy Kurt Frederick Ludwig.\r\n\r\nMr. De Wohl's work on behalf of British intelligence was chronicled in a 2017 Daily Beast article titled \"Louis de Wohl: The Astrologer Who Helped Foil Hitler\": https://www.thedailybeast.com/louis-de-wohl-the-astrologer-who-helped-foil-hitler\r\n\r\nThe BSC's connection to Mr. De Wohl was documented in a separate 2006 Guardian article titled \"The Secret Persuaders\": https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/19/military.secondworldwar\r\n\r\nProof of death is not required as Mr. De Wohl's date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with respect to the FBI's collaborations with foreign intelligence services. Mr. De Wohl was a foreign intelligence officer operating inside the United States as part of a propaganda campaign organized by British intelligence services, one of which, the BSC, shared intelligence with the FBI in that same period. The FBI's involvement in, or knowledge of, any efforts to lobby the American public on the subject of entry into World War II prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor would contribute significantly to public understanding of America's role in that conflict.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

This indictment would have likely generated FBI documentation of the novel \"The Affairs of Gloria.\" Following his acquittal, and due in part to his anger at the government, Banis began incorporating gay themes into dozens of books that he published under different pseudonyms.\r\n\r\nA description of his life and career can be found online here: https://www.pulpcurry.com/2019/03/farewell-to-victor-j-banis-pioneer-of-gay-pulp-popular-fiction/\r\n\r\nHere is a list of pseudonyms he used during his writing career:\r\nVictor Jay\r\nJ. X. Williams\r\nJay Vickery\r\nJan Alexander\r\nLynn Benedict\r\nV. J. Banis\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the writer Victor J. Banis (including all pseudonyms)  from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Banis held by the Sioux City Satellite \"resident agency\" Office, the Martinsburg Satellite \"resident agency\" Office which likely maintained files on Banis. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Victor J. Banis. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Victor J. Banis.\r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Victor J. Banis. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThe release of records held by the bureau would benefit the historical record. Thank you for the bureau's commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

It also says that when the acting ACIJ was an IJ, he sent a fake email purporting to be from the EOIR Director to a third party. This is deeply concerning. Immigrants ordered removed by this person have a right to know if he is a biased adjudicator and if anything he did might reflect bias that would have affected their removal proceedings. Accordingly, we intend to obtain through the FOIA and publish the full report.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
