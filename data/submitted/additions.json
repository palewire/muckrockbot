The duty to segregate ensures that agencies are not allowed to issue \u201csweeping, generalized claims of exemption for documents.\" Mead Data Cent., Inc., v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1977)\r\n\r\nRegarding the surveillance footage, please note the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in Michael S. Evans v. Federal Bureau of Prisons. USCA Case #18-5068 (D.C. Cir. 2020). In that case, the circuit court held that the video surveillance footage is subject to the same segregability standards as other FOIA records. (\"It is not at all clear why the government could not at least isolate some screenshots that would meet the same sort of segregability standards typically applied to printed material.\" Id.)\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I will give that contact a try. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, could I request the name(s) and contact information for IDOC personnel who oversee mental health programming or coordinate external rehabilitative initiatives, particularly those involving mindfulness, trauma-informed care, or wellness programming? These individuals would be the Indiana government counterparts responsible for overseeing the relationship with Centurion.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m currently conducting outreach to explore interest in offering a free, evidence-based meditation program for incarcerated individuals. To do so responsibly, I\u2019d like to speak with the appropriate individuals \u2014 whether within Centurion or IDOC \u2014 to understand if this might be aligned with existing priorities.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not requesting any confidential records, only public-facing professional contact information.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time and support.\r\n\r\nWarmly,\r\nAndrew Ma\r\nVipassana Prison Trust",
