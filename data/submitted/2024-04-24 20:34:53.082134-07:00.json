To reduce processing time, please provide as much detail as possible regarding the specific records you are requesting.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2023 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2023.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2023 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n*** FORWARD THIS PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST TO PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICER ***\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll records related to or mentioning Paul Helliwell, aka Paul Lionel Edward Helliwell , aka Paul L. E. Helliwell (September 17, 1914 \u2013 December 24, 1976). Mr. Helliwell was an officer in the Office of Strategic Services and later a Miami-based lawyer representing clients like the Walt Disney Company. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) created records on Mr. Helliwell on a number of occasions, including:\r\n\r\n- An applicant investigation for a position in the federal government, conducted in 1949;\r\n\r\n- Criminal investigations related to bankruptcy proceedings in the 1970s;\r\n\r\n- Criminal investigations related to organized crime in Las Vegas and the Bahamas in the 1960s and 1970s.\r\n\r\nFBI memorandums containing information mentioning these records were furnished to the Watergate Special Prosecution Task Force between October 1974 and March 1975 and can be found at the National Archives, confirming the existence of an FBI file on Mr. Helliwell. Therefore, I am requesting these records and all others that were generated mentioning, or may be related to, Paul L. E. Helliwell.\r\n\r\nProof of death is not required as Mr. Helliwell's date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to the FBI's handling of the Watergate investigation and its investigations into organized crime.

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for all contracts awarded by, or on behalf of, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) to Advanced Echelon LLC (UEI: W7D1H4WMXCQ7). This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Solicitations/Standard form 1449\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by the Advanced Echelon LLC\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media. \r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to its research into anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAnomalous health incidents (AHI) are events occurring between 2016 and the present day that have resulted in a condition, or a series of related conditions, afflicting intelligence agents and diplomats working for the governments of the United States and Canada. In 2017, the Associated Press reported on a number of such incidents that happened in Cuba the year prior that led to the United States pulling staff from its embassy in that country. Since then, AHI have continued to generate considerable media attention and stories focusing on the national security implications have appeared in the New York Times and The New Yorker, among many other publications. Based on sources in the Intelligence Community, journalists working for these publications have suggested that AHI may have been caused by directed energy weapons, or ranged weapons that attack a target with electromagnetic radiation like ultra-high frequency radio waves.\r\n\r\nIn January 2022, however, the Central Intelligence Agency issued an interim report stating that the agency found no evidence to support claims that a foreign adversary such as Russia or China was responsible for causing AHI. This was supported by an intelligence assessment published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on March 1, 2023, which states, in part, \"most [Intelligence Community] agencies have concluded that it is 'very unlikely' a foreign adversary is responsible for the reported AHIs.\"\r\n\r\nAs of January 2024, there have been over 200 reported AHI and many of the victims themselves believe they were subject to attacks by directed energy weapons. Given that most of these individuals have been identified as high-ranking officials across multiple federal agencies, any investigations into claims of AHI and/or the effects of directed energy on humans would be of considerable public interest. This is especially important in light of the fact that, as part of the HAVANA Act of 2021, both Congress and the President approved compensation in the range of $140,000 or $187,000 per person to individuals diagnosed as suffering from AHI.\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 2024, Advanced Echelon LLC's CEO Gregory Edgreen appeared on CBS News' 60 Minutes to discuss his involvement with an investigation conducted by the DIA into AHI. Per the 60 Minutes report, Edgreen is a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel who claims to have served as the project lead for a DIA working group on AHI. Lt. Col. Edgreen also states Advanced Echelon will provide care for government officials and intelligence agents diagnosed with AHI.\r\n\r\nGiven the DIA's creation of an AHI Program (first reported here: https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2023/03/16/us-spending-millions-havana-syndrome-research/), and Lt. Col. Edgreen's association with a DIA-led investigation into AHI, there is a public interest in knowing if Advanced Echelon LLC has been awarded any contracts in the field of AHI research or care by, or on behalf of, the DIA.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
