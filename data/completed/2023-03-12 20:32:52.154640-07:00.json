Imperial Tobacco PLC, between January 1, 2020 and present.\"  Based on what you have requested, I have to run email searches separate from the OSH inspection information because emails are maintained in a separate system. Due to the sensitive nature of emails, I am the only authorized person within the agency with all email access who may run such a search.\r\nTo date, I have attempted to run the requested company names in a myriad of ways, but because of the commonality of several words  (e.g., alliance, brands, tobacco) and your request for \"all of the agency's email correspondence\" (no specific NC Dept of Labor employee), I am getting thousands of emails that include those words; further, the search must be run through all 350+ NCDOL employees, so each search is taking several hours to run.  I then have to review the emails to see if the email is applicable to your request, such as only referring to \"Alliance One International\" instead of some other Alliance One reference.  I have continued to attempt to refine the searches, in an attempt to produce a more reasonable-sized list. Please be advised that based on my prior attempts, I must advise you that it will  take me extensive time to go through such information.\r\nIs there a way you can refine your request or narrow the time frame?  Are there any specific NCDOL employees that may have been corresponding with these companies or are there specific email addresses within those named companies that I could use to refine the search?  Any information would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nJill F.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am appealing the denial of my FOIL request for \"All emails sent by ex-Chief Judge Janet DiFiore from July 1, 2022, to the date that her resignation as Chief Judge became effective.\"\r\n\r\nIn denying my FOIL request, OCA cited Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3) and (COOG AO-18863 (April 5, 2012), COOG AO 18949 (Aug. 20, 2012)) to justify their determination that my request was overly broad and did not sufficiently describe the records requested.\r\n\r\nPublic Officers Law \u00a7 89(3) states that records must be \"reasonably described,\" which my request was, specifically requesting emails sent by one employee of OCA during a roughly one-month period.\r\n\r\nCOOG AO 18949 (accessible at https://docsopengovernment.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/2013/18949.html) states that \"agency staff are not required to engage in herculean or unreasonable efforts in locating records to accommodate a person seeking records.\" In that opinion, the request in question would have required combing through 3,000 emails to find the correspondence between two specific individuals over an unbounded time period.\r\n\r\nThat is not the case here. I am rather requesting the emails sent by one government employee over a one-month period.\r\n\r\nCOOG also noted that agencies have property denied \"requests for all email communications transmitted or received by a particular government officer or employee over a period of several years, without regard to subject matter or content.\" Again, the scope of this request is far narrower.\r\n\r\nOCA did not state that it would require unreasonable, or even particularly extensive, effort, to complete this request. In the opinion cited by OCA, COOG wrote: \"When an agency has the ability to locate and identify records sought in conjunction with its filing, indexing and retrieval mechanisms, it was found that a request meets the requirement of reasonably describing the records, irrespective of the volume of the request.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that OCA has the ability to locate and identify the emails sent by its former chief over a one-month period. Accordingly, my appeal should be granted.",

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPlease be advised that certain event reasons have been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). \r\n5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy... \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. \r\nPlease also be advised that although the District does have an incident reporting database (Aspen) that is used to document incidents, it does not comprehensively track disciplinary/misconduct action against students. Although some student discipline is maintained in our incident reporting database,\u00a0 it does not comprehensively track the information you appear to be seeking. For example, an entry showing a school code of conduct violation might not always result in disciplinary action. Additionally, the date that an incident was entered may not be the same date as when the discipline was issued. Furthermore, multiple students may be involved in a single incident report in various roles such as a participant or a witness. In order to determine if an incident report resulted in disciplinary action the District would have to read through each of the hundreds of incident reports submitted, reconcile them with various student records, some of which are kept at the school-level, and generate a new record that is not done in the normal course of business. However, please use this link and scroll down to \u201cSuspension/Expulsion\u201d to view similar data available on the District\u2019s website: https://www.cps.edu/about/district-data/metrics/ Please note that the Illinois Freedom of Information Act applies to existing records only and public bodies are not required to compile data from multiple sources into a single record, or answer questions (See generally Hites v. Waubonsee Comm. College, Il App 2d, 150836 (2016)(... \"requests went beyond a search for records\u2014that is, the data in the databases\u2014and instead improperly sought information about those records.\" quoting National Security Counselors v. Central Intelligence Agency, 898 F. Supp. 2d 233, 271 (D.D.C. 2012) and Chicago Tribune v. DFPR, IL App. (4th) 130437 at 8 (2014) (\"[t]he Department was not obligated ... to answer plaintiff's \"general inquiry question\" concerning the number of initial claims since this would have required creating a new record.\") \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPlease be advised that certain event reasons have been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). \r\n5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy... \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. \r\nPlease also be advised that although the District does have an incident reporting database (Aspen) that is used to document incidents, it does not comprehensively track disciplinary/misconduct action against students. Although some student discipline is maintained in our incident reporting database,\u00a0 it does not comprehensively track the information you appear to be seeking. For example, an entry showing a school code of conduct violation might not always result in disciplinary action. Additionally, the date that an incident was entered may not be the same date as when the discipline was issued. Furthermore, multiple students may be involved in a single incident report in various roles such as a participant or a witness. In order to determine if an incident report resulted in disciplinary action the District would have to read through each of the hundreds of incident reports submitted, reconcile them with various student records, some of which are kept at the school-level, and generate a new record that is not done in the normal course of business. However, please use this link and scroll down to \u201cSuspension/Expulsion\u201d to view similar data available on the District\u2019s website: https://www.cps.edu/about/district-data/metrics/ Please note that the Illinois Freedom of Information Act applies to existing records only and public bodies are not required to compile data from multiple sources into a single record, or answer questions (See generally Hites v. Waubonsee Comm. College, Il App 2d, 150836 (2016)(... \"requests went beyond a search for records\u2014that is, the data in the databases\u2014and instead improperly sought information about those records.\" quoting National Security Counselors v. Central Intelligence Agency, 898 F. Supp. 2d 233, 271 (D.D.C. 2012) and Chicago Tribune v. DFPR, IL App. (4th) 130437 at 8 (2014) (\"[t]he Department was not obligated ... to answer plaintiff's \"general inquiry question\" concerning the number of initial claims since this would have required creating a new record.\") \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).
