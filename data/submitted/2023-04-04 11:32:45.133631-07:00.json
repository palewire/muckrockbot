The incident involving Officer Daniel Calixte Badge #863 resulted in a public outcry and raised questions about police conduct and use of force. As a member of the public, I have a right to access these records to gain a better understanding of the incident and to hold law enforcement accountable.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold, redact, or destroy information related to this request will result in legal action and complaint. The failure to comply with FOIL is a serious matter and can result in both criminal and civil penalties.

U.S. Dep't of Justice, 756 F.3d 100, 117 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that \"the public has a vital interest in information regarding the operations of its government\" and that the FOIA \"embodies the basic principle that an informed citizenry is essential to democracy\").\r\n\r\nMatter of DaimlerChrysler Corp. v.

In addition, I remind you that FOIA requires agencies to produce records in their entirety, even if portions of the records are exempt from disclosure. See, e.g., Bevis v. Department of State, 801 F.2d 1386, 1389 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (stating that an agency must \"release all reasonably segregable portions of [the] record\").\r\n\r\nI also remind you that FOIA requires agencies to disclose records even if they have been deleted or improperly redacted. See, e.g., Payne Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 486, 488 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (stating that an agency must \"conduct a reasonable search for records, and cannot limit its search to only those records that it believes to be intact\").\r\n\r\nIf any records responsive to this request have been destroyed, deleted, or otherwise disposed of, I ask that you provide the following information:\r\n\r\nThe date and circumstances of the disposal or destruction;\r\n\r\nThe name, title, and position of the person who authorized the disposal or destruction;\r\n\r\nThe name, title, and position of the person or persons responsible for carrying out the disposal or destruction;\r\n\r\nThe procedures that were followed for disposing of or destroying the records; and\r\n\r\nA description of the records that were destroyed or disposed of.\r\n\r\nFinally, I remind you that FOIA provides for attorney's fees and litigation costs to be awarded to a prevailing plaintiff. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E). Therefore, I urge you to comply fully with this request and to respond within the statutory time frame.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",

This request includes metadata associated with the records, such as author, date, and time of creation.\r\n\r\nAs a requester, I would like to bring to your attention that it is crucial to read this request carefully and provide the requested information in a complete and accurate manner. Failure to do so may result in legal action, including filing a complaint with the New York State Committee on Open Government or a court of law, in order to compel the production of the requested records.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that this request is properly processed, I ask that you carefully review the details of this request, including the scope of documents and information being requested, the timeframe for the requested records, and the specific key string searches to be conducted. If any clarification is needed, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent reports have indicated that Governor Hochul has received numerous threats of violence and harm since taking office, including on social media platforms such as Twitter. As a concerned citizen and advocate for transparency, I request access to any documents, emails, or other information in the possession of the New York State Police and their Counter Terrorism Unit that relate to these threats, including any information gathered through electronic surveillance or other investigative methods.\r\n\r\nTo assist in the search for responsive records, I request that the following keystring searches be conducted:\r\n\r\n\"Kathy Hochul\"\r\n\"Governor Hochul\"\r\n\"threats\"\r\n\"violence\"\r\n\"harm\"\r\n\"social media\"\r\n\"Twitter\"\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that this request includes not only records related to direct threats against Governor Hochul, but also any records related to the New York State Police's response to such threats, including any investigations, protective measures, or communications with other law enforcement agencies or government entities. The Counter Terrorism Unit is included in this request due to their expertise in responding to threats against public officials.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is denied or exempt from disclosure, please cite the specific exemption and provide an index of the withheld or redacted records, as required by law.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold or delete responsive documents will be appealed in a court of law. Any such actions may result in legal proceedings to compel the production of the records and any applicable penalties. I also request that any responsive records be provided on a rolling basis, meaning that records should be provided as they become available instead of waiting for all records to be collected before responding to the request.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer to the following court cases and legal principles:\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Law (FOIL), Public Officers Law Article 6: This law requires the government to provide access to records maintained by government entities.\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004): This case held that FOIA requires agencies to disclose records unless the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption.\r\n\r\nNewsday LLC v. Empire State Development Corporation, 98 A.D.3d 36, 944 N.Y.S.2d 78 (2d Dept. 2012): This case held that \"an agency must identify which exemption(s) it asserts to justify withholding the requested information, and state in a conclusory fashion how the exemption applies to the particular documents or parts thereof.\"\r\n\r\nMatter of Johnson v. N.Y. State Police, 196 A.D.2d 794, 601 N.Y.S.2d 64 (3d Dept. 1993): This case held that \"an agency cannot simply deny access to documents or information sought under FOIL by invoking a statutory exemption; rather, the agency has the burden of demonstrating that the exemption applies to the material in question.\"\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This request includes metadata associated with the records, such as author, date, and time of creation.\r\n\r\nRecent reports have indicated that Governor Hochul has received numerous threats of violence and harm since taking office. As a concerned citizen and advocate for transparency, I request access to any documents, emails, or other information in the possession of the Governor's Office of New York that relate to these threats.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer to the following court cases and legal principles:\r\n\r\nSoucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067 (D.C. Cir. 1971): This case held that the public has a strong interest in obtaining information about government activities, including any threats made against public officials.\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004): This case held that FOIA requires agencies to disclose records unless the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption.\r\n\r\nFOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Pub. L. No. 114-185, 130 Stat. 538 (2016): This law updated and strengthened the Freedom of Information Act, emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in government and requiring agencies to proactively disclose certain records to the public.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in a readable electronic format, such as PDF or Microsoft Word, and include the metadata associated with the records. If any portion of this request is denied or exempt from disclosure, please cite the specific exemption and provide an index of the withheld or redacted records, as required by law. \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold or delete responsive documents will be appealed in a court of law. Any such actions may result in legal proceedings to compel the production of the records and any applicable penalties.

This incident has generated significant public interest and raised questions about national security, law enforcement response, and the role of extremist groups in planning and executing the attack.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am interested in the following information:\r\n\r\nPre-intelligence knowledge: Records and communications that detail any information the FBI had prior to January 6, 2021, regarding potential threats, plans, or coordination related to the insurrection.\r\nPlanning, coordination, and execution: Records that detail the planning, coordination, and execution of the event.\r\nInvestigations and prosecutions: Records related to any investigations and prosecutions that have resulted from the insurrection.\r\nPost-event information: Records and analysis of the insurrection's impact on national security, law enforcement response, lessons learned, and any related policy changes or recommendations.\r\nPlease include any information obtained through cross-references, ELSUR (Electronic Surveillance) records, and interagency communications. Additionally, I request a search for records containing the following keywords: \"January 6th,\" \"Capitol,\" \"insurrection,\" \"riot,\" \"protest,\" \"QAnon,\" \"Proud Boys,\" \"Oath Keepers,\" and any other terms relevant to the event.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA statute and subsequent case law support the public's right to access these records. In Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), the Supreme Court recognized that the purpose of the FOIA is to \"open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.\" Furthermore, in Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73 (1973), the Court emphasized that FOIA \"mandates a policy of broad disclosure of government documents.\"\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is denied or exempt from disclosure, please cite the specific exemption and provide an index of the withheld or redacted records, as required by law. Be advised that any attempt to withhold, destroy, or redact information without proper justification may result in legal action to enforce compliance with the FOIA.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan",
