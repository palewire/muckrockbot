        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords of: \r\n- Officers with authorized access to ALPR systems\r\n- Any audits that include records for the reason of the search, misuse, and how many times the ALPR search was run. \r\n- The number of times other agencies, including federal agencies, with access to the department's ALPR data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott",

        "communication": "Dear Ed Burton,\r\n\r\nApologies for the delay. I am applying a number to each of your requested items for ease of reference, as well as, providing a response in red to each item.\r\n\r\n  1.  Any risk assessments, emergency or incident response plans produced by the University of California Davis between April 20, 2024 and the time that this request is processed that mention any of the following words: \"protests,\" \"demonstrations,\" \"occupation,\" \"camp,\" \"encampment,\" \"Israel,\" \"Gaza,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Anti-semitism,\" \"Islamophobia,\" \"PULP,\" or \"Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine.\"\r\n\r\nPlease see The UC Davis Police Policy Manual found at  Police Department - UC Davis Police Policy<https://police.ucdavis.edu/professional-standards/policies> for current information regarding risk assessments, emergency or incident response plans.  I am also searching for any additional documents that may exist after publication of this manual. All information identified as responsive to your request will be reviewed, and made available for your access, in accordance with relevant law and University policy. The estimated date for production of the requested records is on or around November 11th, 2024.\r\n\r\n  1.  Any reports or logs about surveillance activities on pro-Palestine or pro-Israel student protesters on the University of California Davis campus, produced by the university, university police, or local police. These may include written reports based on CCTV camera footage, reports of relevant social media posts, plans for future surveillance, etc., between April 20, 2024 and the time that this request is processed.\r\nPlease see The UC Davis Police Policy Manual found at  Police Department - UC Davis Police Policy<https://police.ucdavis.edu/professional-standards/policies> for current information regarding social media, video, and facial recognition surveillance information.  Any student related information, if existed, would be denied pursuant to The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g).  Subsequently, they are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act (\u201cPRA\u201d), as the PRA allows the University to withhold records from disclosure where disclosure of the records is exempt or prohibited under federal or state law (Government Code \u00a7 7927.700).\r\n\r\nAs I\u2019m sure you are aware, FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of records directly pertaining to students, and generally prohibits the disclosure of such records to the public without the consent of the affected student(s).  (34 CFR 99.30 and 99.31).  In this case, the records you have requested are \u201ceducation records\u201d that contain \u201cpersonal information\u201d about a student.  (34 CFR 99.3).  The records cannot feasibly be redacted to protect the identity of the student (i.e. cannot be de-identified), and therefore can only be released with the student\u2019s consent.\r\n\r\n  1.  Any email correspondence between the University of California Office of the President (UCOP), the UC Davis Office of the Chancellor, the UC Davis Associate Chancellor/Chief of Staff, and Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs between April 20, 2024 and and the time that this request is processed, that mention the following words: \"protests,\" \"demonstrations,\" \"occupation,\" \"camp,\" \"encampment,\" \"Israel,\" \"Gaza,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Anti-semitism,\" \"Islamophobia,\" \"PULP,\" or \"Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine.\"\r\nUC has considered your request and before we can acknowledge it, we need to address the fact that it\u2019s overly broad. Even \u201ca clearly framed request\u201d may be unduly burdensome if it \u201crequires an agency to search an enormous volume of data for a \u2018needle in the haystack\u2019 or conversely, \u2026compels the production of a huge volume of material.\u201d  California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Ct. (1998) 67 Cal. App. 4th 159, 166. You have not selected custodians which is necessary to perform an email search. You have provided keywords, but this list is overly broad and will likely produce a voluminous set of records. UC Davis has responded to several public records requests related to your keywords. We will produce those records because they are the result of similar searches, and we believe they are also responsive to your request. Once you review those documents you may submit a public records request with specific information to conduct a search for potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nThe estimated date for production of these previously released records is on or around October 1st, 2024.\r\n\r\n4. Any agreements (including informal, not-signed, or draft agreements that would take place over email) or memoranda between the University of California Office of the President (UCOP), the UC Regents, the UC Davis Office of the Chancellor, the UC Davis Associate Chancellor/Chief of Staff, and UC Davis Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs between April 20, 2024 and and the time that this request is processed.\r\n\r\nA search for responsive records was conducted and it has been determined no records exist pursuant to the California Public Records Act.\r\nAt this time, items #2 and #4 are considered closed. Items #1 has an estimated date for production of on or around November 11th, 2024. Items #3 has an estimated date for production of these records is on or around October 1st, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nHeather Urzua\r\nLegal Operations Manager\r\nUC Legal \u2013 UC Davis Office of the Campus Counsel\r\nOne Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616\r\nPhone: 530-754-6295\r\nhttps://campuscounsel.ucdavis.edu/",

I have also copied in the response for ease of reference. However, it was determined that similar previous records releases would be provided to you as they contained a similar search criteria. Upon further review of those records, we intended to release to you, it was discovered that yes, the custodian and keywords were similar, the date reference was not. Therefore, we are uncertain if the previous release would be responsive to your request.\r\nTo summarize, you have selected departments, however, specific custodians are necessary to perform an email search. You have also provided keywords, but this list is overly broad and will likely produce a voluminous set of records. For the keywords, we would ask that you narrow and prioritize the list to allow us to conduct a search for a reasonable number of records. We will then acknowledge your request and provide records to you on a rolling basis. I\u2019d like to propose a few options to assist you in getting the records you want as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Confirm the UC Davis custodians you are interested in. Below is a suggestion of custodians:\r\n     *   Chancellor, Gary May\r\n     *   Vice Chancelor, Pablo Reguerin\r\n  *   Narrow a timeframe\r\n  *   Identify a specific record\r\n  *   We can release previous communications related to the same departments and keywords to you. However, the date range is not similar.\r\n  *   Prioritize your keyword list. At this time, you have requested:\r\n\r\n  1.  protests\r\n  2.  demonstrations\r\n  3.  occupation\r\n  4.  camp\r\n  5.  encampment\r\n  6.  Israel\r\n  7.  Gaza\r\n  8.  Palestine\r\n  9.  Anti-semitism\r\n  10. Islamophobia\r\n  11. PULP\r\n  12. Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine\r\nPlease note, it is possible exempt exemptions may apply to some of these records. These exemptions could include:\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine (CA Evid. Code \u00a7 954 and Code of Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2018.030(a), respectively, as incorporated into Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.705);\r\n\u00b7         Records that are exempt due to the deliberative process privilege under Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000. Courts have applied section 7922.000 to exclude from public review materials the disclosure of which \u201cwould expose an agency's decision-making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency's ability to perform its functions\u201d (Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1342.). The materials withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege meet the requirements that the materials are both pre-decisional and deliberative (American Civil Liberties Union of Northern Cal. v. Superior Court (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 76.);\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Personnel, medical, or similar files are exempt pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7927.700, and personal contact information is exempt from disclosure pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.000, where disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; The public interest served by withholding private personal contact information outweighs any public interest served by disclosure.\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Exempt from disclosure pursuant to The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g). FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of records directly pertaining to students, and generally prohibits the disclosure of such records to the public without the consent of the affected student(s).  (34 CFR 99.30 and 99.31).\r\n\r\n3. Any email correspondence between the University of California Office of the President (UCOP), the UC Davis Office of the Chancellor, the UC Davis Associate Chancellor/Chief of Staff, and Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs between April 20, 2024 and and the time that this request is processed, that mention the following words: \"protests,\" \"demonstrations,\" \"occupation,\" \"camp,\" \"encampment,\" \"Israel,\" \"Gaza,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Anti-semitism,\" \"Islamophobia,\" \"PULP,\" or \"Popular University for the Liberation of Palestine.\"\r\n           UC has considered your request and before we can acknowledge it, we need to address the fact that it\u2019s overly broad. Even \u201ca clearly framed request\u201d may be unduly burdensome if it \u201crequires an agency to search an enormous volume of data for a \u2018needle in the haystack\u2019 or conversely, \u2026compels the production of a huge volume of material.\u201d California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Ct. (1998) 67 Cal. App. 4th 159, 166. You have not selected custodians which is necessary to perform an email search. You have provided keywords, but this list is overly broad and will likely produce a voluminous set of records. UC Davis has responded to several public records requests related to your keywords. We will produce those records because they are the result of similar searches, and we believe they are also responsive to your request. Once you review those documents you may submit a public records request with specific information to conduct a search for potentially responsive records.\r\nPlease let me know how you\u2019d like to proceed or if I can answer any questions about the process. You can reach me directly at publicrecords@ucdavis.edu<mailto:publicrecords@ucdavis.edu>.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nHeather Urzua\r\nLegal Operations Manager\r\nUC Legal \u2013 UC Davis Office of the Campus Counsel\r\nOne Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616\r\nPhone: 530-754-6295\r\nhttps://campuscounsel.ucdavis.edu/",

Yes, I will be fine with narrowing the requests in some of the ways you propose.\r\n\r\nCustodians: Chancellor, Gary May, and Vice Chancellor, Pablo Reguerin\r\n\r\nI am primarily interested in the date range April 20-July 1 2024. If that overlaps with your parallel requests, I am comfortable receiving documents responsive to those requests first, and making a new request if needed for the latter dates. Thank you.\r\n\r\nReprioritizing my list of terms:\r\n1. protests\r\n2. encampment\r\n3. Israel\r\n4. Gaza\r\n5. Palestine\r\n6. Anti-semitism\r\n7.

Franklin\r\nRd Ewing, IL.\r\n\r\nI have attached the petition, secretary's report, proof of publication,\r\nOrder of denial of petition request, verbatim records from the court\r\nreporter, a letter of rehearing request from the petitioner, and a letter\r\nof denial of rehearing from the Regional Board of School Trustees.\r\n\r\nDocumentation of policy for investigating reports of residency fraud.\r\n\r\nThere is no policy for investigating residency fraud.  Districts have\r\nresidency policies by statute.  In instances where residency is being\r\nskirted, districts can hold residency hearings to remove those in\r\nviolation.  The Regional Superintendent of Schools is tasked with any\r\nappeals that result from such hearings.  I have none on record.  In\r\ninstances where violations are made known to me, a phone contact is made\r\nwith the school districts for them to pursue.\r\n\r\nDocument showing number of fraud claims made annually and if possible\r\nbroken down by adjudication status.\r\n\r\nA search of my correspondence shows 1 file on hand for a residency\r\ncomplaint (letter was anonymous).   I am including that letter,  with names\r\nredacted due to the very small nature of the district involved which would\r\nrisk the possibility of identifying the children involved.\n*Matt Renaud*\r\n*Regional Superintendent of Schools*\r\n*Regional Office of Education #13*\r\n*Clinton-Jefferson-Marion-Washington Counties*",

I am not requesting final plans, applications, or board packets already posted online. I specifically seek non-published communications such as internal emails, memos, meeting notes, and text messages created or received between January 1, 2023 and the date this request is fulfilled.\r\n\r\n1. All internal or external communications involving BPDA staff, City legal staff, or developers (including Dream Collaborative or Madison Park) discussing:\r\n\r\n* Strategies to avoid Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) review\r\n* Use of PDA designation or Urban Renewal overlays to bypass traditional zoning or appeal processes\r\n* Decisions to phase the project under 50,000 square feet to avoid triggering Article 80 Large Project Review\r\n* Any aggregation analysis across project phases under Article 80\r\n\r\n2. All communications, internal memos, or analysis discussing whether the Harrison parking lot project should have undergone Large Project Review under Article 80, including debate about scope, timing, or whether other parcels should be considered part of the same project.\r\n\r\n3. All communications (including email, text, or Teams/Slack messages) between BPDA staff or the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing related to implementation of the 10% homeless housing set-aside policy for this project. This includes discussions of:\r\n\r\n* Whether the policy applies to Phase One or future phases\r\n* Concerns about addiction, mental health, or service requirements for residents\r\n* Site-level management or public safety considerations for set-aside units\r\n\r\n4. Any emails, memos, or internal notes referencing whether to notify or exclude Worcester Square Area Neighborhood Association (WSANA), Chester Square, or other neighborhood groups near the site. Include any explanation for limiting notice or tailoring outreach away from legal abutters.\r\n\r\n5. Any emails or discussions justifying why this project was treated as part of Plan Nubian despite being outside the published boundary, including any political or planning rationale for doing so.\r\n\r\n6. Any internal communications regarding the collection or filtering of public comments, including:\r\n\r\n* Use of template letters or coordination with third parties to submit public support\r\n* Filtering of comments by zip code, abutter status, or affiliation\r\n* Internal tallies or comment summaries distinguishing support vs opposition\r\n\r\nPlease provide the above records in digital form. If any part is withheld, provide a written explanation citing the applicable exemption under G.L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26), and release any non-exempt portions.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrian McCarter",

We will provide the responsive records within\r\nten (10) business days. If it is determined that additional time is needed\r\nto compile the requested materials, you will be notified within this\r\nten-day period.\r\n\r\nGiven the broad scope of your request, I would appreciate it if you could\r\nreview the search terms I plan to use to make sure that I capture the\r\ncommunications that meet the criteria you request.

For example, if there\u2019s an email between\r\nsomeone in the Mayor\u2019s Office and a community advocate that doesn\u2019t copy a\r\nPlanning or BPDA staff member, it would not appear in my search. Those c\r\nommunications are maintained by the City\u2019s Public Records Office, which\r\ncoordinates records requests across other City departments.\r\n\r\nYou can submit a public records request to the City\u2019s Public Records Office\r\nvia the following link: Boston City Public Records Center\r\n<https://bostonma.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(jn2bhvbuesn4eumcufollldk))/supporthome.aspx>\nBest,\r\nDanielle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*----*\r\n\r\nDanielle Cournoyer (pronouns she/her/hers)\r\n\r\n Public Records Specialist\r\n\r\n Planning Department\r\n\r\n City of Boston\r\n\r\n 617-918-4448 (w)",

I\u2019m now following up to ensure the search scope fully captures all responsive records in BPDA Planning\u2019s custody.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the six proposed search terms, I\u2019d like to request the addition of a few targeted terms to help ensure complete coverage of the original request:\r\n\r\n\u201cnotice\u201d OR \u201cmailing\u201d OR \u201ccertified\u201d OR \u201cUSPS\u201d OR \u201cabutter\u201d\r\n\u201cnotification policy\u201d OR \u201cnotice procedure\u201d OR \u201cabutter notice\u201d\r\n\u201cvendor\u201d OR \u201cmail service\u201d OR \u201cmailing coordination\u201d\r\n\u201clegal notice\u201d OR \u201cnotice requirement\u201d\r\n\r\nThese are aimed at capturing records related to abutter notification, distribution methods, internal coordination, and legal compliance.\r\n\r\nAlso, as I work to better understand how this request was routed, could you clarify whether the City\u2019s Records Access Officer typically forwards overlapping requests to both BPDA and the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing when the subject matter clearly involves both departments? In this case, I don\u2019t see evidence that a parallel search was initiated at MOH, despite its role in the project.\r\n\r\nPlanning has been consistently helpful on past requests, and I appreciate your continued engagement on this one. I\u2019m simply trying to make sure the full administrative record is located across departments, and would welcome any insight you can share.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This response applies only to\r\nrecords that exist and are in the custody of the Planning Department. *(See\r\n\"A Guide to the Massachusetts Public Records Law\", (2022) p. 32, n. 115).*\r\n\r\nIn answer to your public records request, please find the responsive\r\nrecords\u202fthrough the link below:\r\n\r\n*PRR 6.8.2025 - BWSC Parking Lots*\r\n<https://bpda.box.com/s/uuipkwpxfjn4s46j7cbop2yfuuh2n0x1>\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a\u202fpresumption\u202funder the Massachusetts Public Records Law that\r\ngovernment records are public; however, government records custodians are\r\npermitted to redact or withhold portions of public records, so long as a\r\nspecific exemption to the law is cited.\u202f(*See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (26))*\r\n\r\nThe Planning Department has exercised (2) exemptions in reviewing your\r\nrequest:\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. Attorney-Client\u202fPrivilege -  We have\u202fwithheld\u202fone (1) email based on t\r\n   he attorney-client\u202fprivilege. The withheld record represents staff\r\n   seeking legal advice from department attorneys and/or department\r\n   attorneys providing legal advice. The request for legal advice was made\r\n   upon the expectation of confidentiality by the Planning Department staff as\r\n   a client. Disclosure of the withheld records would be a waiver of attorney\r\n   client privilege, and as a client, the Planning Department does not\r\n   intend to waive its privilege. The included privilege log satisfies the\r\n   disclosure requirements of Massachusetts law, as it includes \u201cthe names of\r\n   the author and recipients, the date, the substance of such record,\u201d and\r\n   this response satisfies a description of \u201cthe grounds upon which\r\nthe attorney\r\n   client privilege is being claimed.\u201d  See G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10A(a); 950 CMR\r\n   32.06(3)(d).\r\n\r\n   2. Privacy Exemption -  All personal cell phone numbers and email\r\n   addresses have been redacted pursuant to the second clause of the\r\nprivacy exemption\r\n   set forth in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(c). The Planning Department determined\r\n   that the release of personal cell phone numbers and personal email\r\n   addresses would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, as this\r\n   information constitutes \"intimate details of a highly personal nature,\" and\r\n   is not otherwise available for public consumption. It is the position of\r\n   the Planning Department that the privacy interests of the individuals\r\n   outweigh any public interest in its release.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDanielle\r\n\r\n*Under Massachusetts law, you may appeal this response to the Supervisor of\r\nRecords in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth.

We understand you are seeking the following records: \"To Whom It May Concern: Pursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: Manuals and forms regarding non-binary, transgender, and gender-diverse individuals, including but not limited to intake procedures. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. Sincerely, Rose Terse\" The first installment of records responsive to your request is available to you now in the Public Records Request Center. Click the link below to retrieve the records within 30 days. General Records Request - G012150-051825  This installment contains DAJD Policies, both Adult and Juvenile Division, responsive to your request. There were no redactions applied to this installment. This link works best with the Google Chrome browser, and pop-up blockers need to be turned off. Per RCW 42.56.120(4), WAC 44-14-04006(1) and KCC 2.12.250(H), the King County Executive Branch can close a records request as abandoned if a requestor does not inspect, view, download, or pick up the entire set of records or one or more of the installments within 30 days of its release. There is no obligation for us to continue producing records that are not being collected by a requestor. I am still working with DAJD staff to determine if any other responsive records are available. I have scheduled the next installment/update for 7/16/2025. Please contact me if you have any questions. Sincerely, Jeremiah Schuetze Public Records Coordinator 206.263.3709",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to Fred Lee Crisman (July 22, 1919 -  December 10, 1975), who was an author from Tacoma, Washington known for claims of paranormal events and 20th century conspiracies. In 1947, Crisman was involved in the Maury Island incident, an early UFO hoax. In 1969, Crisman was subpoenaed by Jim Garrison to testify in the case against Clay Shaw in the John F. Kennedy assassination. During this time, he hosted a radio talk show under the pseudonym \"Jon Gold\" and wrote a book, The Murder of a City, Tacoma published in 1970 through Transistor Publishing Company. In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that forensic anthropologists had analyzed and compared the photographs of the \"tramps\" with those of Crisman. Conspiracy authors consider Crisman a nexus point for a number of conspiracies and cover-ups from the late 1940s until his death in 1975. His death has been widely reported. \r\n\r\nPlease include records relating to the June 1947 hoax known as the Maury Island Incident, which refers to claims made by Fred Crisman and Harold Dahl of falling debris and threats by men in black following sightings of unidentified flying objects in the sky over Maury Island in Puget Sound. I am also requesting a cross-reference search with the people and events described in the above paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Redex Corp. The FBI has located approximately 2948 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFOIA Negotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nNeed a status check?

        "communication": "Good Afternoon Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Richard Bast.  The FBI located approximately 3,144 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, we would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  If you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nThe current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 56 months. \r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one. \r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-4894.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov\r\n540-868-4894",

Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request.  You request the following information:\r\n\r\nAll communications that include the term \"Gulf of America\" or \"renaming the Gulf of Mexico\".\r\n\r\nThis should include\u2013but not be limited to\u2014emails, notes, memoranda and presentations between USGS staff and between USGS staff and external third parties.\r\n\r\nPlease include all documentation within the period January 1, 2024 to January 22, 2025, inclusive.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 2025, the USGS FOIA office received a similar FOIA request from Mr. Dave Levinthal, assigned control number DOI-2025-003169, for the following information:\r\n\r\nRequest disclosure from the Office of the Director, Office of Communications and Publishing, U.S. Board on Geographic Names, Office of the Alaska Regional Director, and Office of the Southeast Regional Director.\r\n\r\n1. Any records and documents \u2014 including but not limited to emails, memoranda, notes, electronic chat messages and calendar items \u2014 that include any of the following words/names in either uppercase or lowercase form on changing the name:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America\r\n\u2022 Denali to Mt. McKinley or Mount McKinley\r\n\r\n2. The same types of records on purchase of Greenland\r\n\r\nThe date range for this request is January 1, 2025, to the present.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 2025, the USGS FOIA office received a similar FOIA request from Bloomberg News, assigned control number DOI-2025-003184, for the following information:\r\n\r\nRequest disclosure from the US Geological Survey's U.S. Board on Geographic Names\r\n\r\n1) All records, which includes, but is not limited to emails (including attachments), text messages, internal studies, final reports, directives, memos, letters, on changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America.\"\r\n\r\n2)The same types of records on changing the name of Denali to \"Mount McKinley.\"\r\n\r\n3) Emails (including attachments) of U.S. Board on Geographic Names staff that mention \"Gulf of America\"\r\n\r\n4) Emails of U.S. Board on Geographic Names staff that mention Denali or Mount McKinley.\r\n\r\nThe timeframe for this request is January 1, 2025 to the present.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, on January 22, 2025, the USGS FOIA office received a similar FOIA request from WIRED, assigned control number DOI-2025-003203, for the following information:\r\n\r\nRecords dated from December 1, 2024 through the time this request is processed relating to Donald Trump's desire to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America and the related executive order and in the possession of Michael Tischler, Shellie Zahniser, or Chris Hammond of the U.S. Geological Survey.  The term \u201crecords\u201d includes emails (with attachments) but also refers to other documents and items, such as text messages; invitations, communications, and chats from meeting applications such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams; encrypted apps such as Signal, WhatsApp, and others; phone records; calendar entries; recordings of virtual or in-person meetings; and communications on collaboration platforms such as Slack. It omits news articles and messages from listservs that distribute them unless accompanied by substantial commentary from one of the above-named people or an interlocutor.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the Complex processing track.  We have gathered materials as potentially responsive to DOI-2025-003169, DOI-2025-003184, and DOI-2025-003203.  However, we have not yet completed a review of these records.  We will provide records in rolling releases to you in conjunction with releases issue for DOI-2025-003169, DOI-2025-003184, and DOI-2025-003203.\r\n\r\nWe classified you as an \u201cother use\u201d requester.  As such, we may charge you for some of our search and duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our review costs; you are also entitled to up to 2 hours of search time and 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.49(a)(1).  We do not anticipate any fees related to your request.\r\n\r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.  You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:\r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road \u2013 OGIS\r\nCollege Park, Maryland  20740-6001\r\nTelephone:     (202) 741-5770\r\nFax:                 (202) 741-5769\r\nToll-free:         1-877-684-6448\r\nE-mail:            ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>\r\nWeb:                https://www.archives.gov/ogis\r\n\r\nPlease note that using OGIS services does not affect the timing of filing an appeal with the Department\u2019s FOIA & Privacy Act Appeals Officer.

You also may agree to an alternative time period for processing by communicating with us, our FOIA Requester Center, or the FOIA Public Liaison.  Contact information for the Department\u2019s FOIA Requester Centers and FOIA Public Liaison is available at https://www.doi.gov/foia/foiacenters.\r\n\r\nYou may also seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).  If you choose to contact OGIS, you may do so in any of the following ways:\r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road \u2013 OGIS\r\nCollege Park, Maryland  20740-6001\r\nTelephone:      (202) 741-5770\r\nToll-free:         1-877-684-6448\r\nE-mail:            ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>\r\nWeb:                https://ogis.archives.gov<https://ogis.archives.gov/>\r\n\r\nYou may file an appeal with the Department\u2019s FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer regarding this delay.  If you choose to appeal this delay, you may do so anytime between now and the date we make our determination on the FOIA request.  Appeals arriving or delivered after 5 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, will be deemed received on the next workday.\r\n\r\nYour appeal must be made in writing.  You may submit your appeal and accompanying materials to the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer by mail, courier service, fax, or email.  All communications concerning your appeal should be clearly marked with the words: \"FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL.\"  You must also include with your appeal copies of all correspondence between you and USGS concerning your FOIA request, including your original FOIA request and USGS's response.  Failure to include with your appeal all correspondence between you and USGS will result in the Department's rejection of your appeal, unless the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer determines (in the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer\u2019s sole discretion) that good cause exists to accept the defective appeal.\r\n\r\nPlease include your name and daytime telephone number (or the name and telephone number of an appropriate contact), email address and fax number (if available) in case the FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Officer needs additional information or clarification of your appeal.\r\n\r\nDOI FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Office Contact Information\r\nDepartment of the Interior\r\nOffice of the Solicitor\r\nAttn: FOIA/Privacy Act Appeals Office\r\n1849 C Street, N.W.\r\nMS-6556 MIB\r\nWashington, DC  20240\r\nTelephone:      (202) 208-5339\r\nFax:                 (202) 208-6677\r\nEmail:              FOIA.Appeals@sol.doi.gov<https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=FOIA.Appeals@sol.doi.gov>\r\n\r\nFor more information on FOIA Administrative Appeals, you may review the Department's FOIA regulations at 43 C.F.R.

Please be advised that a contractor, Unity Health Care, Inc., provides health care services to DOC inmates. The information you are requesting relates to the contractor\u2019s personnel matter. It is not the kind of information that DOC creates and maintains. Under the FOIA, an agency\u2019s search obligation is limited to records or information the agency has created and/or maintained. Finally, DOC did not create and did not find the requested list.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this response a denial of your FOIA request, please be advised that, under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR 412, you may appeal to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nIf you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal\u201d or \u201cFOIA Appeal\u201d in the subject line of the letter as well as on the outside of the envelope.  The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request, (2) a copy of this letter, (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and or arguments advanced in support of disclosure, and (4) a daytime telephone number, and e-mail and/or U.S. Mail address at which you can be reached.  The appeal must be emailed to foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov> or mailed to the Mayor\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (MOLC) at 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 407, Washington, D.C. 20004. Further, a copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to me.\r\n\r\nFailure to follow these administrative steps will result in delay in the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal to the Mayor.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOluwasegun Obebe\nRecords, Information & Privacy Officer\r\nDC Department of Corrections\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\n3924 Minnesota Ave, NE\r\nWashington, DC 20019\r\n(202) 671-2055 (O)\r\n(202) 538-2389 (C)\r\n(202) 671-1705 (F)\r\nSegun.obebe@dc.gov<mailto:Segun.obebe@dc.gov>\r\nwww.doc.dc.gov<http://www.doc.dc.gov/>\r\n[cid:image003.jpg@01DBDADE.CB5B3A30]",

        "communication": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nRequest number: 20250612-RT1\r\n\r\nWe received your request for FLOCK records. We have located responsive records for items 1, 3a and 3b. The scope of records for item 2 would be very large and creating a record that we do not have. Pursuant to per WAC 44-14-04003(6)<https://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=44-14-04003>, we are not obligated to create a record in order to fulfill this request:\r\n\r\n(6) No duty to create records. An agency is not obligated to create a new record to satisfy a records request. However, sometimes it is easier for an agency to create a record responsive to the request rather than collecting and making available voluminous records that contain small pieces of the information sought by the requestor or find itself in a controversy about whether the request requires the creation of a new record. The decision to create a new record is left to the discretion of the agency. With respect to databases, for example, there is not always a simple dichotomy between producing an existing record and creating a new record. In addition, an agency may decide to provide a customized service and if so, assess a customized service charge for the actual costs of staff technology expertise needed to prepare data compilations, or when such customized access services are not used by the agency for other business purposes.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you wish to receive the records responsive to items 1, 3a and 3b there is a fee of $3.50. I have attached the worksheet for how the fee was calculated based off the fact that necessary redactions will be applied to some documents. Please call the main line below during normal business hours Mon-Fri 8:30-4:30) to pay your fee. We will be closed tomorrow, 6/19.\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive payment by 6/27/25 your request will be considered abandoned and closed.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DBE033.AC1569C0]\r\nMiranda Jeter\r\nRecords Clerk\r\nBonney Lake Police Department\r\nOffice Phone (253) 863 - 2218 opt. 4\r\nFax  (253) 863 - 2661\r\n18421 Veterans Memorial Drive E.

Your request was sent to JMD by the US Marshals Service as a misdirected request. The identifying tracking number was 2025-USMS-001026.  For your information, the Justice Management Division assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited. Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track. Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month whereas complex requests necessarily take longer. At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track. Please note that as a general matter, records in the Department are decentralized and our response will only cover information originating with or relating to JMD. If you are seeking information originating with or relating to other components of the Department, please make a FOIA request directly to those components.  If you have a question about the status of your FOIA request, you may contact this office by emailing JMDFOIA@usdoj.gov or by calling 202-616-0253 during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Eastern Time, excluding federal holidays).  Please refer to your assigned JMD FOIA TRACKING NUMBER listed above whenever you contact the Department regarding this request.  Sincerely,  Daniel Wagner FOIA Contact Justice Management Division",

This form includes 30 questions across several categories and appears to be the basis for the 3.81 aggregate score posted on the district\u2019s website in the June meeting minutes. \r\n\r\nTo clarify, can you please confirm whether Form 2 was completed by members of the Board of Education as part of the 2024\u20132025 evaluation process? If so, I respectfully request copies\u2014draft or final\u2014of any completed versions of this form in their entirety. The rubric responses and section-level evaluations offer important context for understanding the final composite score.

Maryland and/or Giglio v. United States. During the current administration of District Attorney Barbara Romo, we have had one Giglio disclosure letter and case re: former Officer Robert Turney in our Cibola County District. Included here is a document fragment detailing the underlying case. The allegation of misconduct came from a discovery from the district court; therefore, we don\u2019t have specific additional records other than the attached letters to:\r\n\r\n  *   The letter the Sheriff of Cibola County asked our deputy to draft and send.\r\n  *   The spreadsheet detailing the cases for which we had to submit a disclosure letter.\r\n  *   A copy of the disclosure letter.( Each letter heading was corrected for each case otherwise the body of the letter was the same, the letter attached is a sample).\r\n  *   Letter to the Defense Counsel\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n//Melissa Howden//\r\n\r\n\r\nMelissa A.
