CBP's Notification to CRCL re the Death of Narendra Kayastha\r\nA notification by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to DHS-CRCL reporting the in-custody death of Narendra Kayastha, an 80 year-old Indian man who died around 7 pm on November 26, 2021, at 4945 Governors Drive in Forest Park, Georgia, while in CBP custody for an immigration inspection. \r\n\r\nCBP's Death notification policy required CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility to notify CRCL through the Privacy and Diversity Office. Page 5. https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2021-Sep/2021_notification-review-procedures-for-certain-deaths-and-deaths-in-custody%20%283%29.pdf. \r\n\r\nCBP's press website did not post notification of Kayastha's death to its public website, and has not acknowledged this death publicly. \r\n\r\n2. CBP's Significant Event Notification (SEN) or Significant Incident Report (SIR) re the Death of Narendra Kayastha\r\nThe CBP-Atlanta SEN or SIR for Mr. Kayastha's death. \r\n\r\nWe respectfully request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), and make the following statements in support thereof under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n1. Narendra Kayastha died in CBP custody during an inspection for immigration violations around 7pm on November 26, 2021 in Forest Park, Georgia. See: https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24413601/cbp-2023-083502_opr_recordpdf.pdf (row 5). \r\n2. Mr. Kayastha was witnessed going unresponsive and medical help was contacted, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's autopsy report. See https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24674455/2021-1037549-0001.pdf (page 2). \r\n3. CBP did not release a public statement regarding Mr. Kayastha's in-custody death, as required by the agency's death notification policy. https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2021-Sep/2021_notification-review-procedures-for-certain-deaths-and-deaths-in-custody%20%283%29.pdf \r\n4. The public has no information regarding what prompted Mr. Kaystha to become unresponsive, how long it took to provide him medical care, or whether he received appropriate care once a provider was contacted. \r\n5. The address CBP recorded for Mr. Kayastha's death is not a hospital emergency department--it is an outpatient, walk-in clinic called Southside Medical Center. https://southsidemedical.net/forest-park/. \r\n6. There is an urgency to inform the public about this alleged federal government activity, and I am a journalist primarily engaged in the dissemination of information.  Specifically, the public has a right to know immediately how Mr. Kayastha died in government custody, why CBP failed to notify the press, and why he was not transported to a higher level care facility. \r\n7. The absence of a public statement by CBP regarding Mr. Kayastha's death reflects an apparent instance of noncompliance with CBP's death notification policy that was in effect at the time.  There is an urgent to need to inform the public regarding why and how this apparently noncompliant death response occurred.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request. For clarity, it is not the date the agency first created the record. \r\nThe following item(s) also apply to your request: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tApproximately 0 pages were withheld in their entirety. \r\n\u2022\tFees: In the processing of this FOIA request, no fees are being assessed. \r\n\u2022\tOther: \r\n\r\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2024-114173 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

Please note that the underlying request was processed on an expedited basis.\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the Department's production of records in response to a FOIA request.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis for the reasons stated in the request for expedited processing in the underlying request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requester,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe have received your request for officer deployment records related to the LASAN CARE+ and RESET operations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to Deployment records, specifically names and number of officers involved, to the extent the record exists, the Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of records that consist of or contain detailed tactical, operational, deployment information, and analysis of potential threats. Disclosure of this information to the public has the potential to enable would-be perpetrators to discern areas of vulnerability and the intelligence assessments, evade security procedures, thereby endangering the operation of the Department and the safety of its officers and the public in the event of similar law enforcement initiatives. Therefore, these records are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to hourly costs, please refer to the City Controller's website at the following link:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPayroll Explorer\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

This policy has been renewed with the same conditions as of 5/1/25, but we do not yet have the new policy in hand. Also below is an email sent for the same request dated March 11, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe Denver Clerk and Recorder would most likely be the custodian of any additional records within the scope of your request, and you may submit requests to that office if you wish to do so. You can find contact information for them at the following link:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Clerk-and-Recorder/find-records/CORA\r\n\r\nThis response is governed by the Colorado Open Records Act and applies only to records in the custody of the Department of Finance.

The relevant section is found on the last page, under \"Assurance of Compliance\". The SPPO requested the documentation be submitted no later than April 30, 2025. If the Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction sent communications to the SPPO requesting an extension or declining to submit the documentation, I request a copy of said communications.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIleana Garnand",

He was born in 1950 and died on April 15, 2025. His death was widely covered in the press: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/us/politics/leonard-zeskind-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, and am currently a reporter of The Boston Globe.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlexa Gagosz",

We consent to that. \r\n\r\nIf the other offices\u2019 trainings referenced on page 10 won\u2019t be likely to be stored by ICE FOIA, or if DHS FOIA has them, maybe you can retain and task only that portion of the request? I\u2019d consent to that as well. \r\n\r\nFinally, I can file a cloned request with ICE FOIA and spare the referral from you all, allowing you to administratively close this request and remove it from your queue, if you believe DHS FOIA has no responsive records. \r\n\r\nReally appreciate your follow up.

What we wanted in making this request was insight into what supervision\u2014or lack thereof\u2014the DHS Chief FOIA/PA Officer engages in when it comes to this serially deficient and unlawful component\u2019s conduct.

You have requested all DHS FOIA policy and training materials referenced on Page 10 of the DHS Chief Privacy Officer's 2018 Chief FOIA Officer Report: https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2018 Chief FOIA Officer Report.pdf, as well as all subsequent versions of FOIA policy and training materials provided to DHS FOIA personnel and DHS agency components\u2019 FOIA personnel AFTER 2018 DHS Chief Privacy Officer\u2019s FOIA report and BEFORE December 21, 2021. \n\nICE has considered your request under both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  Information about an individual that is maintained in a Privacy Act system of records may be accessed by that individual unless the agency has exempted the system of records from the access provisions of the Privacy Act. \n\nICE has conducted a search of the ICE Office of Regulatory Affairs and Policy (ORAP) for records responsive to your request and no records responsive to your request were found. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c) (2006 & Supp. IV (2010).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nWhile an adequate search was conducted, you have the right to appeal this determination that no records exist within the above mentioned ICE office(s).  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of the original response letter, within 90 days of the date of the letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8.  You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 and refer to your tracking number. Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA Office \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nFreedom of Information Act Office \n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",
