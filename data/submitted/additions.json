All reports about COVID-19 prepared by the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company that were provided to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) between the dates of 3/1/2020 and 7/1/2020.\r\n\r\n2. All emails originating from any email address ending in \" @mckinsey.com \" that were sent to/from/between any of the following individuals between the dates of 3/1/2020 and 5/1/2020: \r\n- Gov. Gavin Newsom\r\n- Sonia Angell\r\n- Sandra Shewry\r\n- Tomas J. Aragon\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to include any attachments to those emails.\r\n\r\nIf it is not possible for your agency to conduct a search for emails originating from a specific domain, such as @mckinsey.com, please let me know and I can provide you with a specific list of McKinsey email addresses to search for instead.\r\n\r\nMcKinsey & Co. is a global management consulting firm whose work regarding various government responses to COVID-19, including vaccination efforts, have come under scrutiny recently in the U.S. (https://www.propublica.org/article/how-mckinsey-is-making-100-million-and-counting-advising-on-the-governments-bumbling-coronavirus-response) and in France (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/france-mckinsey-consultants-covid-vaccine.html). The firm's government contracts were also the subject of a recent public records lawsuit in Tennessee (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tennessee-sued-not-releasing-covid-221610057.html). McKinsey & Co. also recently came under scrutiny in the national press over potential conflicts of interest related to the firm's relationships with pharmaceutical companies and regulators (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/business/mckinsey-purdue-fda-records.html). \r\n\r\nDuring the pandemic in 2020, the State of California had contracts with McKinsey and Company, which are disclosed on the state's COVID-19 contract disclosure website: https://covid19.ca.gov/contracts/\r\n\r\nBased on that information, fully understanding how CDPH and State officials interacted with McKinsey & Co. when developing California's COVID-19 response, including the information and advice that was provided to CDPH and State officials by McKinsey & Co. regarding COVID-19, is of the highest importance to the public. The requested information should be made available to the public with as few redactions as possible, and at the lowest fee possible, as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen providing the records related to this request, please specifically certify that no other responsive documents related to this request exist.\r\n\r\nThe requested information will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and/or activities of the government, and is not primarily in my commercial interest.\r\n\r\nIn order to help determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am a freelance journalist whose work is published regularly by print and digital news outlets and magazines. You can view my portfolio at www.erinmariemiller.com/clips. I have previously been determined a media requester by federal agencies in other FOIA requests. As a member of the media, I request a waiver of all fees. In the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $25 for the requested information. If the fee for this request exceeds this amount, please notify me in writing for permission prior to beginning work on the request.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nPlease send all documents related to this request to this email address.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Marie Miller",

All contracts and subcontracts between the consulting firm McKinsey & Company (or any abbreviated or alternative version of the firm's name, including but not limited to McKinsey or McKinsey & Co.) and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) between the dates of 1/1/2019 and 03/31/2020.\r\n\r\n2. All formal or informal agreements between the consulting firm McKinsey & Company (or any abbreviated or alternative version of the firm's name, including but not limited to McKinsey or McKinsey & Co.) and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) between the dates of 1/1/2019 and 03/31/2020.\r\n\r\nEmails delivered to me under two previous FOIA requests (MDHHS FOIA request H014602-021922: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/michigan-117/tcf-regional-care-center-emails-20-124958 and MDHHS FOIA request H016452-082322: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/michigan-117/mckinsey-company-covid-19-models-reports-and-emails-2020-132888) show that consultants from the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company were involved in MDHHS's pandemic response and policy-making processes as early as March 27, 2020, when the firm appears to have been tasked with operational oversight and data management. McKinsey consultants continued to communicate with MDHHS and other state officials about pandemic policy throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThat initial involvement, and the firm's continued communications with state officials throughout 2020, appear to imply that a contract or agreement must have existed between MDHHS and McKinsey, as it seems highly unlikely the global consulting firm would communicate with government officials regarding public policy and the management of public health data in the absence of a formal agreement. However, MDHHS has so far failed to provide me with copies of any contracts between MDHHS and McKinsey during the time McKinsey provided consulting assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 (as shown in emails between MDHHS officials and McKinsey consultants during that time period that were provided to me under earlier FOIA requests).\r\n\r\nIn light of that, I am hopeful that MDHHS will be able to provide some type of formal or informal agreements and/or contracts that might have existed during the requested time period so that I can better understand the nature of the relationship between MDHHS and McKinsey during the first half of 2020 and before.\r\n\r\nUpon delivery of the requested documents, please specifically certify that no other records related to this request exist.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government during a historic crisis.\r\n\r\nBecause the requested documents should already be prepared in an easily deliverable format, I assume there will be very little work involved in retrieving them and thus no fees. In the event that there are fees, however, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I am willing to pay up to $25 for the requested information. If there is a fee that exceeds that amount, please notify me prior to initiating any work on the request.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available, or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nPlease deliver all responsive documents to this email address only.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Marie Miller",
