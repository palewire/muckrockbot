Specifically, MuckRock requests the following records:\r\n\r\n    1. Any \u201cAssignment Agreements\u201d that have been generated between the USDS and any other agencies or departments that mention FOIA and/or media questions.\r\n    2. A copy of any notifications sent from an agency to the USDS under the process outlined above.\r\n    3. A copy of any communications regarding the policy of notifications about FOIA requests sent from another agency to the USDS.\r\n    4. Any logs maintained by the USDS that detail or track such requests, including any fields that might be captured in such a log.\r\n\r\nRequest for News Media Requester Status\r\n\r\nMuckRock requests a limitation on search and review fees on the grounds that they are a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and do not seek the requested records for commercial use.\u00b9  Accordingly, fees associated with the processing of this request should be limited to reasonable duplication costs.\r\n\r\nMuckRock \u201cactively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience.\u201d\u00b2 Specifically, MuckRock is an internationally recognized non-profit news outlet, that regularly covers issues of public importance through the original analysis of primary source materials, particularly government records. This analysis is made available to the public via MuckRock\u2019s website. MuckRock intends to use its editorial skills to turn any information obtained through this request into a report, article, or other relevant product, freely distributed to educate the public.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\nMuckRock requests expedited processing pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). There is a \u201ccompelling need\u201d for these records because the information requested is \u201curgen[tly]\u201d needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information \u201cto inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d\u00b3\r\n\r\nFirst, the requested records seek to inform the public about the USDS\u2019s information security policies. There is a compelling and urgent need to inform the public about the policies the USDS has adopted to protect itself against cybersecurity incidents and safeguard its data. As of the filing of this request, lawmakers, reporters, and the general public have expressed interest and concern as to the steps the USDS has taken to ensure operational and cybersecurity.\u2074\r\n\r\nSecond, MuckRock is \u201cprimarily engaged in disseminating information\u201d within the meaning of the FOIA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). See also 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(ii). MuckRock is a Massachusetts-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that brings together journalists, researchers, activists, and regular citizens to request, analyze, and share government documents. It provides a repository of hundreds of thousands of pages of original government materials,\u2075 as well as original reporting and analysis,\u2076 particularly in the areas of government spending, surveillance, and public safety. MuckRock\u2019s publications are broadly circulated to the public and widely available at no cost. \r\n\r\nMuckRock intends to analyze, publish, and disseminate to the public information gathered through this request. The records requested are not sought for commercial use and MuckRock plans to disseminate the information disclosed as a result of this request to the public at no cost. \r\n\r\nGiven the foregoing, the request satisfies the requirements for expedited processing. Pursuant to applicable statutes and regulations, MuckRock expect a determination regarding expedited processing within 10 days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nRequest for Records in Electronic Format \r\nMuckRock requests that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format, if possible.\u2077\r\n\r\nAlternatively, MuckRock requests that the records be provided electronically in text-searchable PDF, in the best image quality in the USDS\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files. MuckRock further requests that you provide an estimated date on which you will finish processing this request.\u2078\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                   ***\r\nIf this FOIA request is denied in whole or in part, please provide the reasons for the denial, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i).
