If possible, please provide this data in database or spreadsheet format and include the case number, incident date, incident time, subject injured indicator, subject injury force related info (e.g. Yes or No), subject age, subject gender, subject ethnicity, subject weapon type, incident area occurred, force type, officer division (e.g. law enforcement operations, detention/correctional operations, etc.), badge number and names associated with the officers involved. If one or more of these fields or dates is unavailable, provide all fields and/or information that is available responsive to my request. If no database or spreadsheet format is available, please provide copies of each individual use of force report or other report where use of force information is documented/reported by officers. Note, this is for all use of force incidents reported by your agency, not limited to only those incidents required to be reported under state or federal programs.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSamuel Sinyangwe",
