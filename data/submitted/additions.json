Fazendeville was a small Black community located by the Chalmette Battlefield which is part of the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve Louisiana. The homeowners had their homes seized through eminent domain in 1964 and the homes were bulldozed that year. I have been told that Guy Hughes, a park employee, has the photographs under his supervision. We would like the whole collection of photographs of Fazendeville, including the photographs of the properties being bulldozed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTammy Mercure",
