See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

We received your request on September 28, 2023.  Your\r\nrequest states:\r\n\r\n*Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\nrecords: All military service records for Mark Keith Robinson, DOB: August\r\n18, 1968, including but not limited to discharge paperwork, training logs,\r\nand service awards.*\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of your inquiry, we are forwarding your request by this\r\nemail to the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) for Military Records\r\nin St. Louis for appropriate handling.  The NPRC will assign your request a\r\ntracking number and respond directly to you.  In the future, if you need to\r\ncontact the NPRC, you can do so by mail or fax to the following address:\r\n\r\nNational Personnel Records Center\r\n1 Archives Drive\r\nSt. Louis, Missouri 63138\r\n\r\nTelephone:   314-801-0800\r\nTelephone (Toll Free):  1-866-272-6272 (only within the US)\r\nFax:  314-801-9195\r\n\r\nFor your reference, below you will find your original submission.\r\n\r\nOn our website at https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records\r\nyou can find information about requesting Official Military Personnel Files\r\n(OMPFs) that are not yet archival records fully open to the public.  At the\r\nwebsite for the National Archives at St. Louis,\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/st-louis/ <https://www.archives.gov/st-louis/%20>,\r\nyou will find information about requesting Official Military Personnel\r\nFiles that are now archival records open to the public.  The OMPF normally\r\nbecomes an archival record 62 years after the date of discharge.\r\n\r\nAt www.archives.gov/foia <http://www.archives.gov/foia%20> we provide\r\ninformation about FOIA.  On our home page, www.archives.gov, you can learn\r\nabout the resources that we offer to the public, and access our online\r\ncatalog.\r\n\r\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, and pursuant to guidance received from the\r\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB), NARA had adjusted its normal\r\noperations to balance the need of completing its mission-critical work\r\nwhile also adhering to the recommended social distancing for the safety of\r\nour staff.  NPRC is working with a reduced on site staff who are\r\nprioritizing veterans' burial requests, homeless veterans, and medical\r\nemergency requests.  As a result of this re-prioritization of activities,\r\nyou may experience a delay in receiving a substantive response to your FOIA\r\nrequest.

See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8). Pursuant to the CIA\u2019s Historical Review Program regulations:\r\n\u201cIn no case will information be kept classified in order to conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; to prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency; or to prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of national security.\u201d\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this request because there is a compelling need for these records. Our organization urgently needs the information requested because we are primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nRequest for expedited processing\r\nTargeted Justice requests the expedited processing of this request because the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\nYou can produce all the documents requested in an indexed, digital format.\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). Provided that the Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, you can reach our attorney Ana L. Toledo at 832-247-3046. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I am writing to request payroll records (for all employees of your institution) from 1984 to 2022 in excel format (same format as the records provided in Adam Goldstein's request filed 9/20 for 2019-2020 records). The information I am looking for is nonpersonal (ie: Name, title, annual pay, year associated with pay, job description). We would like disaggregated figures, not aggregated. To assist in this process, I have listed with more specificity, the information we are looking for: \r\n\r\nAnnual Payroll Records of all, including full time, part time, and student, employees on your institution\u2019s payroll with fields:\r\nName (first and last)\r\nTotal Annual Pay (can be summed or disaggregated into base pay, other pay, overtime pay, benefits, etc).\r\nTitle\r\nYear\r\nDepartment\r\nJob description: the roles, responsibilities and duties of an employee\u2019s title. \r\nIf the institution has a system of categorizing employees please include their categorization and corresponding codebook if relevant. \r\n\r\nTo the extent any of these records may not exist or may not be disclosed, please disclose any segregable parts of relevant documents.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of quantifying staffing and spending changes over time. They are ultimately part of a project to research and educate the public about the makeup of staffing in higher education.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Goldstein",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, et seq. and the holding in Sims v. Central Intelligence Agency, 642 F.2d 562 (1980).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice is a news and human rights organization. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Targeted Justice, I request that you provide a copy of the following documents [or documents containing the following information]:\r\n\r\n2.\tList of the names of institutions and researchers who had conducted research under any current human experimentation Program.\r\n3.\tList of non-consenting human experimentation subjects in the  current human experimentation \u201cProgram\u201d.\r\n4.\tMemorandum of Understanding between CIA and agencies and countries for collaboration in the \u201cProgram\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201cdocument\u201d is to be liberally construed to include any file, paper, microfilm, digital archive, or any other format where the information sought may be stored.\r\n\r\nAs you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8). Pursuant to the CIA\u2019s Historical Review Program regulations:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn no case will information be kept classified in order to conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; to prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency; or to prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of national security.\u201d\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this request because there is a compelling need for these records.  Our organization urgently needs the information requested because we are primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nRequest for expedited processing\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice requests the expedited processing of this request because the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nYou can produce all the documents requested in an indexed, digital format.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). Provided that the Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, you can reach our attorney Ana L. Toledo at 832-247-3046. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWinter Calvert",
