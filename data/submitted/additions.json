        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Tennessee Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nelectronic files on the creation and implementation of the Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods\" a.k.a SCORPION unit from 2021 to 2023. \r\n\r\nThis request includes official documents and files on how the team was constructed and deployed as well as any guidelines, manuals, and instruction documents for officers assigned to the unit. For example, I\u2019d like access to information explaining the squad\u2019s \u201cStandard Operating Procedure\u201d, \u201cMission Statement\u201d, \u201cAssignments\u201d, \u201cLocations of Deployment\u201d, \u201cAccountability\u201d and any other documents and files pertaining to the creation and evaluation of the unit. \r\n\r\nAccording to publicly available information, there are documents explaining the creation of a \u201cnew\u201d unit, as reported by ABC 24 Memphis on July 5, 2024 (Reference link: https://www.localmemphis.com/article/news/local/internal-documents-raise-questions-on-memphis-police-scorpion-unit-cj-davis-statements/522-e4346729-3936-486e-b5cb-4b352e300836) \r\n\r\nAdditionally, publicly available records show that the Memphis Police Department maintains internal \u201cStandard Operating Procedure\u201d documents for specific units, like the 2019 Uniform Patrol Station (Reference link: https://fnolan.com/AO3/UPSSOP_complete.pdf). Therefore, the MPD should have a similar document for the SCORPION unit. \r\n\r\nI would like my above request to be filled in electronic formats (such as .pdf or similar format) whenever possible and if the formats are readily available.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, from 2021 - 2023 when the unit was disbanded,  in an Excel file or similar electronic format, please send the following data points regarding the Scorpion Unit: total officer-involved shootings per year, total arrests per year, and total guns seized per year. In a December 3, 2021 update from former Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland, he shared publicly that the SCORPION unit had made 125 felony arrests and recovered 95 weapons. Therefore, the remaining information should be available (Reference link: https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/TNMEMPHIS/bulletins/2ff2916). \r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $100. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of policing tactics in Portland. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nI request that all future communication be conducted via email or phone call. Whenever possible, I would like the documents that are responsive to my request to be sent through email as well.\r\n\r\nI also request a prompt response to this request. State law requires a seven-business-day response time. If you expect a significant delay in responding to or fulfilling this request, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nPublic records in Tennessee are defined as \u201call documents, papers, letters, maps, books, photographs, microfilms, electronic data processing files and output, films, sound recordings, or other material, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by any governmental entity.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 10-7-503(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKent Hoover, a citizen of Tennessee, in coordination with Josiah Bates.",
