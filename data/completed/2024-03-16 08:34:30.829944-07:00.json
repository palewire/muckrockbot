But as you might guess, the request references a large number of records.  As he said, we must thoroughly review all records to identify and obtain the responsive documents from both external and internal sources.  It is a complex and time-consuming process.\r\n\r\nI am confident that we will have documents ready to provide on or before the December 6th, 2023, date noted in our recent communication.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued patience!\r\nRegards,\r\nRenee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA121F.C2136CB0]",

Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action. \r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force. \r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes: \r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm]. \r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Please find below an updated version of my previously-submitted Freedom of Information Law request. This version provides additional specificity about the requested information. Please let me know if I should call about this request. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for your time and help.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nBeryl\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll materials and records describing and sufficient to show/disclose all law enforcement disciplinary records, including materials on allegations of misconduct made and all disciplinary proceedings taken against any law enforcement officer currently or formerly in the employ of this policing agency.\r\n\r\nFor a more specific definition of the term \u201claw enforcement disciplinary record,\u201d please see Section 86 of the New York Public Officers Law. For a more specific definition of the term \u201claw enforcement officer,\u201d please refer to the definitions of peace officer found in subdivisions twenty-three and twenty-three-a of section 2.10 of the criminal procedure law and subdivision twenty-four of section 2.10 of the criminal procedure law, as well as the definition of police officer found in section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law. \r\n\r\nAs described in the New York Freedom of Information Law, a record is: \r\n\"any information kept, held, filed, produced or reproduced by, with or for an agency or the state legislature, in any physical form whatsoever including, but not limited to, reports, statements, examinations, memoranda, opinions, folders, files, books, manuals, pamphlets, forms, papers, designs, drawings, maps, photos, letters, microfilms, computer tapes or discs, rules, regulations or codes.\"\r\nRecords kept in a digital or electronic form are also records, would be responsive to this request, and should be provided.\r\n\r\nThe request records are typically required to be retained, in part, under the New York State Records Retention and Disposition Schedule MU-1 (http://www.archives.nysed.gov/records/retention_mu-1), including, but not limited to, item no. 365, which includes: \r\n\"Investigative records and disciplinary proceedings, including but not limited to statement of charge, transcript of hearing, notice of decision, letter of termination or resignation, letter of reinstatement, record of appeal procedure, and correspondence.\" \r\nWhile materials under that schedule have a set retention of 3 years after the final decision rendered, this request and materials responsive to it include *all* records held in the possession of any office or individual employed or formerly employed by this policing agency, including those kept off-site, in digital form, and in personnel files.\r\n\r\nPlease note that any failure to provide all potentially-responsive materials and/or the destruction of materials potentially responsive to this request would be a violation of the spirit of the New York Freedom of Information Law, as well as unlawful under the New York FOIL and the terms of the previously-submitted litigation hold notice.\r\n\r\nMaterials responsive to this request include \u2014 but are not limited to \u2014 all complaints, reports, records of discipline and penalties, aggregate collections of complaint and disciplinary materials (spreadsheets, databases), investigatory materials, relevant related correspondence, photographs, video, other related evidence, proof of discipline or fulfillment of penalties, and all personnel materials (including those used in promotion, contract, and other employment negotiations and considerations) that reference or utilize misconduct allegations or disciplinary materials of any sort.\r\n\r\nMaterials responsive to this request include all complaints\u2014 internal, external, and civilian \u2014 and include records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident/complaint: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the investigation, investigatory materials, the disposition of the case, and any subsequent materials related to the execution of any resultant discipline. Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action.\r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force.\r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes:\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - November 30, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \r\n\"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" \r\nPlease also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm].\r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. \r\n\r\nThis request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication.\r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. \r\n\r\nAs far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Below you'll find an updated version of this FOIL request.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate your time and help with this, and I hope you'll let me know if there are any questions I can address.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nBeryl\r\n________________\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, we respectfully request copies of all materials and records pertaining to any and all allegations of misconduct, and any and all disciplinary actions or proceedings taken against, any law enforcement officer, employee, or representative of the Agency, including, but not limited to \r\n(1) investigative records, \r\n(2) allegations or complaints made, \r\n(3) statements of charge, \r\n(4) transcripts of hearings, \r\n(5) notices of decision, \r\n(6) letters of termination or resignation, \r\n(7) letters of reinstatement, \r\n(8) record of appeal, \r\n(9) final decisions rendered, \r\n(10) records sufficient to show any and all penalties imposed or corrective action taken by the Agency, and \r\n(11) all correspondence, written communications, e-mails, faxes, memorandum and the like pertaining to any such allegations, complaints, or disciplinary proceedings.\r\n\r\nFor a more specific definition of the term \u201claw enforcement disciplinary record,\u201d please see Section 86 of the New York Public Officers Law, which defines a \u201claw enforcement disciplinary record\u201d as \u201cany record created in furtherance of a law enforcement disciplinary proceeding, including, but not limited to: (a) the complaints, allegations, and charges against an employee;

Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action.\r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force.\r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes:\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - November 30, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nIf materials are not available for the requested timeframes, please let me know for which periods they are available. We understand that not all recordkeeping systems facilitate convenient access to some materials. \r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \r\n\"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" \r\nPlease also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm].\r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-500-7123. \r\n\r\nThis request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by Gannett Co., Inc., the ultimate parent corporation of the Democrat & Chronicle, and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication.\r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. \r\n\r\nAs far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

It is our interpretation that matters prior to the date of repeal remain protected as dispositions in such matters may have been entered into on the basis of reliance and understanding that Sec. 50-a of the NYS Civil Rights Act would prevent public disclosure of such information.  Additionally, disclosure of disciplinary matters wherein the subject was exonerated or the allegations/claims were determined unfounded would be protected pursuant to New York Public Officer\u2019s Law \u00a787(2)(b), under which access to records may be denied where disclosure \u201cwould constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under the provisions of subdivision two of section eighty-nine of this article.\u201d   The Committee on Open Government has opined that \u201cwhen allegations or charges of misconduct have not yet been determined or did not result in disciplinary action, the records relating to such allegations may\u2026be withheld, for disclosure would result in an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d See, FOIL AO 19775, quoting FOIL AO 17195.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nErik C.

This would include emails, complaints, and any other records regarding or related to AdventHealth/Adventist Health System in our agency\u2019s custody. Thus far, we have already located over 53,000 email records and over 290 complaints records that are responsive to the request.  If there is a specific issue or matter regarding AdventHealth/Adventist Health that the requestor is looking for, that could help us narrow our search and limit the cost and the amount of records that would need to be reviewed for confidential and exempt information.\r\n\r\nIf the requestor wishes to narrow the request or has something more specific they are looking for, please let us know.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nKylie",

First of all, Florida's Office of the Attorney General has been a great help and I sincerely appreciate all of you.\r\n\r\n I am interested in all 290 complaints within the criteria I specified.\r\n\r\nAs far as emails, I separately, I revise the criteria to be from August 29th, 2022 to 2023, the date of the processing of this request. Please let me know if the emails still produce too numerous of results in that timeframe or is overly burdensome. If so, I narrow the criteria further in regards to emails to include only the following individuals that are presently part of AdventHealth (aka Adventist Health System) leadership as either sender, recipient, cc, bcc, or otherwise in the body of the email. These individuals in leadership are: Terry D Shaw (Terry.Shaw@AdventHealth.com) [CEO/President nationwide for AdventHealth], Randy Haffner (Randy.Haffner@AdventHealth.com) [CEO of AdventHealth's Florida Division], Opal Howard (Opal.Howard@AdventHealth.com)[Chief People Officer], Heather Ross (Heather.Ross@AdventHealth.com) [Director of Employee Relations], Jeffrey Bromme (Jeffery.Broome@AdventHealth.com) [Chief Legal Office], and the Paul Rathbun (Paul.Rathbun@AdventHealth.com) [Chief Financial Officer] as well if any email originated from their personal emails, if that is readily known, otherwise that may be disregarded. Additionally, I add an attorney that represents AdventHealth, whose name is Paul Prather (PPrather@littler.com) [Law Firm: Littler].\r\n\r\nThe full leadership page (which may be slightly outdated since some contacts do not apparently have an @AdventHealth.com email address) can be found here: https://www.adventhealth.com/adventhealth-leadership\r\n\r\nIf this still produces too numerous results, you may contact me for additional clarification, and I will further narrow the criteria.\r\n\r\nThank you so much,\r\n\r\nBailey Pillon",

These years are both approximate and inclusive. \r\n\r\nPreemptively addressing FOIA exemption concerns:\r\n\u2022 These records concern a case that can be safely assumed to be closed and in no danger of being compromised, given that Rosenthal's case is noted as convicted 1984 and his death was recorded in 2018. \r\n\u2022 Proof of Rosenthal's death is attached, in the form of a printout from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator (Register Number as 08075-020) noting his status as \"Deceased.\"\r\n\u2022 Proof of the case's resolution is attached in the form of a UPI record of conviction (\"AROUND THE NATION; 9 Convicted in Atlanta On Cocaine Smuggling (Published 1984)\". The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/27/us/around-the-nation-9-convicted-in-atlanta-on-cocaine-smuggling.html\u200c)\r\n\u2022 In the balancing test of privacy concerns against public interest, the privacy concerns are minimal (the case was tried decades ago, was a public event, and at least Rosenthal is deceased). Meanwhile the public interest in such the historical study of OCDETF cases has been established by reviews of the Management Information System by the National Archives.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nT. McElwee",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your following up with us regarding this request.  The DHS regulation requires that requesters describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable DHS personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. A reasonable description contains sufficient information to permit an organized, non-random search for the record based on the component\u2019s filing arrangements and existing retrieval systems. The regulation also states that to the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist a component in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, component, or reference number.\r\n\r\nConversely, requests seeking \u201cany records\u201d without regard to a specific topic or keyword generate a great deal of material that is unlikely to be of interest to the public or shed light on the government\u2019s operations but will still need to go through the page-by-page, line-by-line review process.  Processing these kinds of requests do not provide as much value to the public, and hinder our ability to respond to all FOIA requesters in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nThus, please provide us with an office or component, names of individuals/targets that you believe have these records, in addition to, keywords or phrases and a specific timeframe to narrow the scope of your search.  Let us know if you have any further questions.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nThe Privacy Office\r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\r\n245 Murray Lane SW\r\nSTOP-0655\r\nWashington, D.C. 20528-0655\r\n'202-343-1743 | '866-431-0486 | 7 202-343-4011\r\n\u2022 foia@hq.dhs.gov<mailto:foia@hq.dhs.gov>\r\n\r\nThis is covered by federal and state law governing electronic communications and may contain confidential and legally privileged information.

Our complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 181 days from the date of receipt for processing.

        "communication": "Good morning Mr. Best,\r\n\r\nReference is made to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request 1360313-0 for FBI records concerning John Francis Good.  The FBI has located approximately 1,782 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-100 page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing.  Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nWe contact requesters with requests of this size to see if there might be a way to possibly narrow the scope.  Is this something you might be willing to consider?  If so, please contact me and we can discuss this possibility.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\nLeslie Wilson\r\n540-868-4894\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nNegotiation/RIDS/RMD\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation",

Sorry for my not being informed of the name change.\r\n\r\nWith regards to this FOIA on John Good, one main file and two reference serials were located on this subject.  The main file does consist of 5 sections with approximately 1,777 pages covering Mr. Good's career.  If you do want this request to be processed from the medium track queue with current estimated time for processing at about 7 months, the first two sections can be processed in whole and the 3rd section partial processing up to the 949 threshold for page count.  For this reduced scope, upon completion of all materials (an interim CD release should be received in about 3 to 4 months), you can place another FOIA request, citing this one, and ask for additional materials to be processed from this case.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you are interested in this.  I do appreciate your consideration and patience.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLeslie Wilson",

        "communication": "Dear Burkely Hermann:\r\n\r\nI am writing in response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request\r\nof February 8th, 2024 for records in the custody of the National Archives\r\nand Records Administration related to Alexander Christopher Efthim. Your\r\nrequest was received in this office on February 20, 2024 and assigned FOIA\r\ntracking number RD 78541.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to the Department of Justice (Record Group 60) file\r\nnumber 146-1-51-3218 on Alexander Efthim, which was referred to by NARA's\r\nTextual Reference division. My initial assessment is that Alexander\r\nChistopher Efthim is the subject of the records. The file was created\r\nbetween May 1951 and June 1955 and consists of an estimated 40 pages.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we conducted a search of all available indexes of records of\r\nthe FBI (Record Group 65) transferred to the National Archives. I\r\nidentified FBI file number 100-HQ-373735 on Alexander Christopher Efthim,\r\ncompiled as part of a Domestic Security investigation, created between\r\nOctober 1950 and September 1974 and consisting of an estimated 100 pages.\r\n\r\nThese records require review for information protected from release under\r\nthe FOIA: https://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide#determine.\r\n\r\nYour request does not exceed 700 pages, so it is assigned to our first-tier\r\nprocessing queue. Taking into consideration our existing backlog, we\r\nestimate it will take 39 months to complete processing.\r\n\r\nBecause the results of your FOIA search request comprise two separate\r\nrecord groups, I was instructed to split them into two separate requests.\r\nThe FBI Index Search relating to Alexander Efthim was assigned FOIA\r\ntracking number RD 78720. Please note that though they are assigned\r\ndifferent tracking numbers they will be processed together at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOnce we notify you that processing is complete, you may either visit our\r\nCollege Park, MD facility to view the files at no cost, or order a\r\nreproduction. Our current fee for reproductions is 80 cents per page, so we\r\nestimate the total cost will be $112.00.\r\n\r\nYou must notify this office of changes to your contact information. If\r\ncommunication is returned as undeliverable and no return address is\r\nprovided, your case will be administratively closed. To change your contact\r\ninformation or to track the status of your request, please email\r\nspecialaccess_foia@nara.gov or call 301-837-3190. Please include your FOIA\r\ntracking number in all communications concerning this request.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with our action on this request and would like the\r\nopportunity to discuss our response, you may contact our FOIA Public\r\nLiaison for assistance:\r\n\r\n\r\nAccessioned Executive Branch Records \u2013 Washington, DC Area\r\n\r\nFOIA Requester Service Center: 301-837-3190\r\n\r\nFOIA Public Liaison: Rebecca Calcagno\r\n\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500\r\n\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n\r\ndc.foia.liaison@nara.gov\r\n\r\n301-837-3190\r\n\r\nIf you have other questions regarding your request, please contact me\r\ndirectly.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcus Bacher\r\nArchivist\r\nSpecial Access and FOIA Program (RF)\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5510\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\nmarcus.bacher@nara.gov\r\n(301) 837-9215\r\nwww.archives.gov/research/foia/",

I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. My primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

They also said:\r\n\r\n\"You may wish to direct your search to the New York City Office of Technology and Innovation\".\r\n\r\nHence, I am expecting relevant records from this agency.\r\n\r\nNow that more than two years have passed since I began this effort, I have considerably less patience for illegal delays. I wish to be as clear as I can be about this: I have no ill will whatsoever for the likely-overworked records access employees, but for the agencies which make it difficult to do your jobs in a timely manner. You may expect me to appeal on grounds of constructive denial should the request be illegally delayed.\r\n\r\nThe request for records, which I am now directing to this agency is:\r\nRecords relating to the total number of restaurants inspected for compliance with state pandemic air filtration and ventilating guidance.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed portable filtration or UVGI instead of MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that were operating the installed filtration or UVGI systems when inspected. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have other mitigation measures in place, when MERV 13 filtration, UVGI, and portable filtration, was not in place. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the number restaurants that have been found to be or are currently out of compliance with air filtration and ventilating guidance. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould no such records exist, I request information on what records and/or statistics are collected regarding air filtration and ventilating guidance enforcement.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, should they be available, records of the actual inspections and results.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I'm very glad to finally be getting real data - it's been three years of chasing various agencies to get this.\r\n\r\nI do have several questions.\r\n\r\nThe filename includes the word \"redacted\", but it's an excel spreadsheet, so I obviously can't see any markup. Can you tell me what's been redacted?\r\n\r\nAre there any descriptions or notes available in city records for the columns?\r\n\r\nWho was the records holder/owner for this dataset? Who was responsible for maintaining it.\r\n\r\nThere are easily tens of thousands of establishments for which many fields are empty. Is data missing? Have those fields been withheld?\r\n\r\nOne local establishment, the Beach Cafe on 2nd, has yes entries for symptom screening, soap, and many related surface sanitation checks, but empty fields for ventilation and filtration checks. I don't see a yes or no - just blank.\r\n\r\nSome establishments that should be in this dataset appear to be missing. I'm using my my favorite pizza place as a sanity check, pizza park on 1233 first avenue, and am struggling to find it. Is there any reason it would be missing or withheld?",

The spreadsheet is a record of various inspections performed by various agencies during the time period specified.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "*Good Afternoon,*\r\n\r\n*Thank you for reaching out to the Carmel police Department with your\r\nrequest.  The information you are requesting can be found on our City\r\nwebsite, listed under Flock Camera Transparency Portal.  If there is any\r\nother information you need, please feel free to contact us.  *\r\n\r\nhttps://ci.carmel.ca.us/police-fire\r\n\r\n*We apologize for the delay in this response as the amount of information\r\nrequested was excessive and we were in the process of adding it all to the\r\nportal for the public to view.*\r\n\r\n\r\n*PRA rec'd 2-16-2024 from Muckrock:*\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers\r\n(\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares\r\nALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives\r\nALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares\r\n\u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives\r\n\u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for\r\nextraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant\r\nSolutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the\r\nData Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is\r\navailable through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as\r\nBOSS, has similar functionality.\r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this\r\ninformation (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has\r\ninterpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does\r\nnot exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be\r\nexported through software your agency has already purchased, and is\r\ntherefore subject to CPRA.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following\r\nrecords:\r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other\r\ncertifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec\r\n1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are\r\nalso often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a\r\nCalifornia law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other\r\ncertifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec\r\n1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods\r\nJanuary 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request.\r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information\r\nrequested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and\r\nwould require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and\r\n\u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the\r\ndate this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period\r\nshorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on\r\nyour retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have\r\nthis data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this\r\nrequest is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1\r\nyear, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the\r\nALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola\r\nSolutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report\r\nfunction. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the\r\ntransparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar\r\nfunctionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system\r\nand can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California\r\nPublic Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in\r\nwhich the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public\r\nunderstand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is\r\ncollected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying\r\naccess to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have\r\nprovided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous\r\nyears. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of\r\nthe agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n\r\nPAUL TOMASI\r\n\nChief of Police\r\n\r\nDirector of Public Safety\r\n\r\nCarmel-by-the-Sea Police Department\r\n\r\nP.O.

According to ShotSpotter, their best practices include steps to ensure that if police officers conclude the ShotSpotter alert was indeed a \u201cfalse positive,\u201d they report that the company to \"keep track and take remedial steps to minimize false positives in the future\". I am looking for any such feedback given to ShotSpotter. \r\n\r\n- Any emails between department staff with the words \"false positive\" and \"Shotspotter\" or \"shot spotter\" or \"sound thinking\".

You requested, \"the signed agreement between the VA and the NAACP.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nReasonable Search Dated 3/5/24 & 3/6/24\r\nOn March 5, 2024, an OSVA FOIA Officer searched through the VA Integrated Enterprise Workflow Solutions (VIEWS), VA's official System of Record for partnership agreements, for responsive records.  An OSVA FOIA Officer used the search term \"NAACP.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 2024, an OSVA FOIA Officer requested that the VA Center for Minority Veterans search for and provided all responsive records in its possession. These two (2) searches yielded seven (7) responsive pages.\r\n\r\nNews Media Fee Category\r\nWe have placed you in the news media category.  For this FOIA request, OSVA does not charge any FOIA fees.  OSVA reserves the right to charge FOIA fees for any future FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nInitial Agency Decision\r\nOSVA releases seven (7) pages redacted with FOIA Exemption 6.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) exempts from required disclosure \"personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"  The Supreme Court has interpreted the term \"similar files\" broadly, to include all information that \"applies to a particular individual.\" U.S. Dep't of State v. Wash. Post Co., 456 U.S. 595, 602 (1982).   FOIA Exemption 6 permits VA to withhold a document or information within a document if disclosure of the information, either by itself or in conjunction with other information available to either the public or the FOIA requester, would result in an unwarranted invasion of an individual's personal privacy without contributing significantly to the public's understanding of the activities of the federal government.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the information being withheld, as indicated on the attached document, under FOIA Exemption 6, consists of the personal signatures of federal employees and partners.  VA releases the names of Senior Executives and federal partners.  Federal employees and partners retain a significant privacy interest under certain circumstances, such as in instances where the release of their information could represent a threat to their well-being, harassment, or their ability to function within their sphere of employment.  The federal employee and partners whose information is at issue have a substantial privacy interest in their personal information.  In weighing the private versus the public interest, we find that there is no public interest in the personal signatures of federal employees and partners.  The coverage of FOIA Exemption 6 is absolute unless the FOIA requester can demonstrate a countervailing public interest in the requested information by demonstrating that the FOIA requester is in a position to provide the requested information to members of the general public and that the information requested contributes significantly to the public's understanding of the activities of the Federal government.  Additionally, the requester must demonstrate how the public's need to understand the information significantly outweighs the privacy interest of the person to whom the information pertains.  Upon consideration of the records, I have not been able to identify a countervailing public interest of sufficient magnitude to outweigh the privacy interest of the individuals whose names are redacted.  The protected information has been redacted and (b)(6) inserted.  \"Withholding a telephone number or e-mail address, alone, is not sufficient to protect that [privacy] interest; alternate means of contacting and harassing these employees would be readily discoverable on the Internet if this court ordered their names disclosed.\"  Long v. Immigration & Customs Enf't, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160719 (D.C. Cir. 2017).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOIA Mediation\r\nAs part of the 2007 FOIA amendments, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) was created to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation. Under the provisions of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the following contact information is provided to assist FOIA requesters in resolving disputes:\r\n\r\nVA Central Office FOIA Public Liaison:\r\nName: Darryl Webb\r\nEmail Address: vacofoiaservice@va.gov<mailto:vacofoiaservice@va.gov>\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS)\r\nEmail Address: ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>\r\nFax: 202-741-5769\r\nMailing address:\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n8601 Adelphi Road\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n\r\nFOIA Appeal\r\nThis concludes OSVA's Initial Agency Decision to request 24-06769-F.  Please be advised that should you desire to do so, you may appeal the determination made in this response to:\r\n\r\n                                                                        Office of General Counsel (024)\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\r\n810 Vermont Avenue, NW\r\nWashington, DC 20420\r\n\r\nIf you should choose to file an appeal, please include a copy of this letter with your written appeal and clearly indicate the basis for your disagreement with the determination set forth in this response.

The Office of the Secretary of State Elections Division maintains election results for races that occur at the district-level or higher; you would need to reach out to the locality or county for the results of a local races.  You can do so by visiting the county election website available at this link<https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/voter/links.shtml#County>, or by reaching out to your County Elections Official at this link<https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/voter/county.shtml>, or your city officials here<https://directory.tml.org/>.\r\n\r\nElection results maintained by the Office of the Secretary of State can be found on our Historical Election Results page for the years 1992 to 2019 at this link<https://elections.sos.state.tx.us/index.htm> and on our Election Night Results page for 2019 going forward at this link<https://results.texas-election.com/landing-page>.  After the completion of the statewide canvass, these results will become available for download under the \u201cReports\u201d tab in PDF or Excel format.\r\n\r\nAdditional information regarding voter turnout and registration statistics is available on our Election Results page at this link<https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/historical/index.shtml>.  Another potential resource for obtaining archival elections and voting information is the Texas Almanac, available at this link<https://www.texasalmanac.com/articles/elections-of-texas-governors-1845-2010>.\r\n\r\nFinally, the individual Texas counties are the custodians of their historical election results and voter registration records.  For historical election data potentially maintained at a more local level, you might reach out to the individual Texas counties using the contact information at this link<https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/voter/current.shtml>.\r\n\r\nShould you need any additional information or have any questions regarding this matter, please feel free to send us an email at Elections@sos.texas.gov<mailto:Elections@sos.texas.gov>.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKate Fisher\r\nElections Division\r\nOffice of the Texas Secretary of State\r\n1019 Brazos Street | Rudder Building, 2nd Floor | Austin, Texas 78701\n",

Specifically, I need the following information to be included in the data.\r\n\r\n1. Text of the ballot initiative/referendum\r\n2. Local government where the election took place.\r\n3. County where the local government is located\r\n4. Election date\r\n5. Result of election (votes for, votes against, pass/fail)\r\n6. Threshold to pass (50%, two-thirds, etc)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have located a potential data source from your state at the following link: https://electionstats.state.ma.us/ballot_questions/search/year_from:1972/year_to:2022/type:is_local\r\nHowever, the data at this link does not contain information on the election date or threshold above. In addition, it contains only information on elections after 2002, while I request data for elections since 1972.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJimin Han",

This database includes all results certified by this office for candidates and questions which appeared on state ballots.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of local ballot questions appear on local election ballots. Those local elections are administered by local election officials and the results are not submitted to or certified by this office. As such, this office does not have local election results for those questions which did not appear on the state election ballot.\r\n\r\nCities and towns may choose to add specific types of local ballot questions to the state election ballot, if the law allows for it. In general, the two most common types of ballot questions included on the state ballot are so-called \u201cProposition 2 \u00bd\u201d questions and Community Preservation Act questions, as those laws specifically allow for the questions to appear on the state ballot. These laws are relatively new, and such questions were not included on ballots until the 1980s, for Prop 2 \u00bd, and the early 2000s, for CPA questions.\r\n\r\nAttached is a spreadsheet of all ballot questions currently in our election results database. Again, it must be noted that this will not include any local question which appeared on a local election ballot.\r\n\r\nFinally, please note that county name is the attached file, because counties are not relevant to election administration or local government in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDebra O\u2019Malley\r\nElections Division\r\nSecretary of the Commonwealth\r\n(617) 727-2828\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that you may appeal this response to the Supervisor of Public Records within 90 days or seek judicial review by commencing a civil action in superior court. G.L. c. 66 \u00a710(A); 950 CMR 32.08(1).\n",

        "communication": "Dear Requester:\r\n\r\nA properly filed FOIA request must be submitted as stated on EOIR\u2019s website.\r\n\r\nAs of December 1, 2022, EOIR no longer accepts FOIA or PA requests by email. EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request an ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request an ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit an ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request an ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting an ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>\n",

        "communication": "Dear ABIR APON, \r\n\r\nThis response acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).\u00a0 Your request has been assigned control number 2023-79284. \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the status of requests submitted through the Public Access Link (PAL) may be tracked at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx, and you will receive an email response to your request upon completion of processing. The status of requests submitted by email or mail may not be trackable through the PAL, but you will still receive an email or mailed response to your request upon completion of processing. (https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx) Please ensure the email address you provided in PAL will be able to receive the messages we send you. Messages rejected by your email account will not be rerouted to you. \r\nPlease be aware that EOIR is a component of the Department of Justice\u00a0and the custodian of records for the \u201cRecord of Proceedings\u201d (ROP), which is the compilation of documents and digital audio recordings produced in proceedings before the immigration courts and the BIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the custodian of records for the \u201cA-file,\u201d which is a series of records of a person\u2019s immigration history and is maintained and stored by DHS. EOIR is not the custodian of records for DHS or its components, nor does EOIR have access to DHS\u2019s A-files. EOIR does not create an ROP until matters are initiated by DHS. Nevertheless, EOIR may create and maintain ROPs for proceedings other than removal proceedings (i.e., credible fear reviews, bond hearings). You may request a copy of your Notice to Appear (NTA) and full A-file from DHS. (https://www.dhs.gov/foia) \r\nNote that parties to immigration cases (including respondents and their representatives of record) have the option to request their Record of Proceedings directly from the immigration court or Board of Immigration Appeals. Please see the instructions here: https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest. (https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest) \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that due to necessary operational changes as a result of the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, there may be significant delay in the processing of your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have filed a fee waiver request, EOIR will address the fee waiver in a separate letter. Most requests for records of proceedings do not require any fees; however, if the fees for processing the request are estimated to exceed $25.00, EOIR will notify you before processing the request to determine whether you will commit to paying the fee or whether you wish to narrow the scope of your request to reduce the fee. Fees may be charged for searching records at the rate of $4.75 (administrative)/$10.00 (professional) per quarter hour, and for duplication of copies at the rate of $.05 per copy. The first 100 copies and two hours of search time are not charged, and charges must exceed $25.00 before we will charge a fee. \r\n\r\nThe FOIA requires an agency to respond within 20 working days after receipt of the request, and EOIR endeavors to meet this standard.\u00a0 The FOIA permits a ten-day extension of this time period, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B), based on unusual circumstances.\u00a0 Your request involves \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d and EOIR is extending the time period to respond by an additional 10 working days because your request requires the collection of records from field offices, or involves a search, collection, and review of voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or two or more agency components. \r\n\r\nEOIR FOIA requests are placed in one of three tracks. Track one is for those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA. Track two is for simple requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.\u00a0 Track three is for complex requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests that may involve sensitive records.\u00a0 As a matter of default, your request has been placed in track two for simple requests.\u00a0 If you have requested expedited processing, EOIR will contact you in a separate letter. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding unusual circumstances, you may contact the EOIR FOIA Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison at (703) 605-1297 or EOIR.FOIArequests@usdoj.gov to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame to process your request, or for any further assistance regarding any aspect of your request. Alternatively, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at (877) 684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nFOIA Intake",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",
