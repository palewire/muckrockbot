I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This material is exempt from disclosure. Government Code section 7923.600, subdivision (a) exempts from California Public Records Act disclosure \u201cany investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local police agency, or any investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local agency for correctional, law enforcement, or licensing purposes.\u201d These records are exempt from disclosure, even if the prospect of enforcement proceedings is not concrete and definite. (Haynie v. Superior Court (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1061,1069; Black Panther Party v. Kehoe (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 645, 654; Younger v. Berkeley City Council (1st Dist. 1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 825, 833; American Civil Liberties Union Foundation v. Deukmejian (1982) 32 Cal.3d 440.) The records remain protected from disclosure even after an investigation has concluded. (Williams v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th 337, 355\u2013362.) Further, the release of such records could violate the privacy rights of involved parties. The California Public Records Act recognizes that the right to privacy is a fundamental interest that the California Constitution protects. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1; Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7927.700 and 7927.705.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you believe this determination is in error, or if you have further information that you wish to provide to us regarding your request, kindly re-submit your request either in person at any Sheriff\u2019s Department station, through our online portal: https://sanbernardinocounty.nextrequest.com/. Please note that, in addition to visiting one of the Department\u2019s stations to make an in-person request for records, you are also welcome to use the portal or email for any future records requests you may have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may also wish to review the Department\u2019s Records Request Guidelines (CPRA) and/or the Department\u2019s California Public Records Act FAQs information on our website at: https://wp.sbcounty.gov/sheriff/divisions/information-services/.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for making a request for records from the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at San Bernardino County.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

        "communication": "Dear FBI:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act. Please produce all records related to Esther Cooper Jackson, a self-proclaimed Black communist revolutionary. Ms. Jackson was born in Arlington, Virginia on Aug. 21, 1917 and died on August 23, 2022 in Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nOTHER NAMES USED: The subject's maiden name was Esther Victoria Cooper. \r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH: \r\n\r\nIn addition to standard practices, please search the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices.\r\n\r\nPlease include a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and things to see if they contain additional records related to Ms. Jackson: (1) James E. Jackson Jr., the subject's husband, (2) Freedomways magazine, which the subject edited, and (3) the Southern Negro Youth Congress, with which the subject was affiliated.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks information that, to my knowledge, is not already in the public domain. Of course, without already knowing what records the Bureau has, I can't say for sure whether those records are already in the public domain or what the public would learn from them; however, because Ms. Jackson has recently died, the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Ms. Jackson was a public figure. News obituaries for Ms. Jackson appeared in the Washington Post and the New York Times, among other publications. According to her obituary in the Washington Post (attached): \r\n\r\n\"Ms. Jackson spent decades on the forefront of the movement for racial justice \u2014 and decades more as a repository of knowledge about the social, political and intellectual movements that helped shape the United States in the 20th century. 'Esther Cooper Jackson\u2019s activism in the Black freedom movement spans over [70 years], and her contributions are nearly impossible to quantify,' Sara Rzeszutek, a professor of history at St. Francis College in Brooklyn and the author of a book about Ms. Jackson\u2019s activism, said in an email.\" \r\n\r\nThus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. \r\n\r\nI am also making this request via MuckRock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that will allow anyone in the world to access all responsive records online for free.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Ms. Jackson has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released before. Again, I cannot be 100% sure if factor is satisfied without already knowing what records the Bureau has. However, given Ms. Jackson's status as a public figure, the Bureau should deem this factor satisfied.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government's surveillance of its critics. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nI would prefer that you produce responsive records electronically if possible: by email attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Public Interest Factors\r\n    \r\n    1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or\r\n    activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor\r\n    because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n    \r\n    2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the\r\n    subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks\r\n    information that, to my knowledge, is not already in the public domain. Of\r\n    course, without already knowing what records the Bureau has, I can't say for\r\n    sure whether those records are already in the public domain or what the\r\n    public would learn from them; however, because Ms. Jackson has recently\r\n    died, the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously\r\n    available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n    \r\n    3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmeaning\r\n    a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u00e2\u20ac\u201das opposed\r\n    to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this\r\n    factor because Ms. Jackson was a public figure. News obituaries for Ms.\r\n    Jackson appeared in the Washington Post and the New York Times, among other\r\n    publications. According to her obituary in the Washington Post (attached):\r\n    \r\n    \"Ms. Jackson spent decades on the forefront of the movement for racial\r\n    justice \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and decades more as a repository of knowledge about the social,\r\n    political and intellectual movements that helped shape the United States in\r\n    the 20th century. 'Esther Cooper Jackson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activism in the Black freedom\r\n    movement spans over [70 years], and her contributions are nearly impossible\r\n    to quantify,' Sara Rzeszutek, a professor of history at St. Francis College\r\n    in Brooklyn and the author of a book about Ms. Jackson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activism, said in\r\n    an email.\"\r\n    \r\n    Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I\r\n    seek.\r\n    \r\n    I am also making this request via MuckRock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site\r\n    that will allow anyone in the world to access all responsive records online\r\n    for free.\r\n    \r\n    4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a\r\n    significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Ms.\r\n    Jackson has recently died\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmeaning that the Bureau can now release responsive\r\n    records that it could not have released before. Again, I cannot be 100% sure\r\n    if factor is satisfied without already knowing what records the Bureau has.\r\n    However, given Ms. Jackson's status as a public figure, the Bureau should\r\n    deem this factor satisfied.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Please See attachment for description.\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation **\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress.

        "communication": "FOIA APPEAL: FEE WAIVER\r\nFOIPA Request No.: 1572070-000 (JACKSON, ESTHER COOPER) \r\n\r\nDear OIP:\r\n\r\nI hearby appeal the Bureau's denial of my request for a fee waiver. \r\n\r\n1. The Bureau states that my request failed to meet at least one of the four public interest factors, but it does not say which factor or factors I failed to satisfy or why. This alone is reason enough to reverse the Bureau's decision, because it makes it impossible for the requestor to meaningfully respond to the denial\u2014rendering the denial arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and a denial of due process.\r\n\r\n2.  My request meets the legal standard for a fee waiver. The subject of the request was a public figure, with news obituaries of her death appearing in major newspapers. Responsive records will be of great interest to historians, political activists, scholars, and all who care about the government's surveillance of political dissidents. I am making this request via MuckRock.com, which will automatically make all responsive records available to the general public for free. There is simply no reason to deny this fee waiver.  \r\n\r\n3. I incorporate by reference the additional arguments I made in my initial request for a fee waiver.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this appeal.\r\n\r\nMost sincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

You did not provide custodians for your email searches and to continue processing your request this information is needed. However, CBP FOIA used the top three leadership names in the Rio Grande sector as your custodians so we can continue your search.Provisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations.

Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). Please note that due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, and a current backlog, it may take 6-9 months to receive a response to your FOIA request.

The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2023-115941 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date our final response is issued, following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.

This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request. For clarity, it is not the date the agency first created the record. \r\nThe following item(s) also apply to your request: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tApproximately [  0] pages were withheld in their entirety. \r\n\u2022\tFees: In the processing of this FOIA request, no fees are being assessed. \r\n\u2022\tOther: \r\n\r\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.

This event, part of the Free Palestine and Resistance Movement against Israeli aggression, is referenced in your press release titled \"HCSO Assists USF Police Department Following Unsanctioned Protest.\"\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\r\nDigital Documents:\r\nBody Camera Footage: Complete recordings from body-worn cameras of all officers engaged from the beginning to the end of their deployment at the protest. Legal support: ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012) affirms the public\u2019s right to record public officials in public settings, which supports the disclosure of body camera footage.\r\nRadio Transmissions: All audio recordings and transcripts of radio communications involving law enforcement personnel during the protest. Legal support: Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978) indicates the public interest in accessing law enforcement communications for transparency.\r\nText Communications: All SMS and instant messages sent to and from officers concerning the enforcement activities at the protest. Legal support: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 34 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 1998) supports the release of communications to ensure transparency in governmental operations.\r\nAerial Footage: All video recordings from helicopters, drones, or any other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used during the protest. Legal support: Electronic Frontier Foundation v. Department of Transportation, 2015 (finding that aerial surveillance footage is subject to disclosure under FOIA to allow public analysis of governmental surveillance practices).\r\nPhysical Documents:\r\nIncident Reports and Briefings: All written reports, memos, and briefing documents pertaining to the law enforcement activities during the protest. Legal support: Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989) supports the disclosure of law enforcement records for public scrutiny.\r\nOperational Plans: Documents detailing the strategies and guidelines used for managing the protest. Legal support: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978) demonstrates the public's right to understand the strategic operations of public authorities.\r\nLegal Precedents and Public Interest Justification:\r\n\r\nThe requested information is of significant public interest, particularly concerning government operations at public protests and the specific enforcement tactics employed against movements advocating for international human rights and resistance against oppression.

If I can find time to make progress on your request without delaying requirements for the litigation I will do so.  However, I still anticipate not being able to focus on your request until the end of late November or early December 2023.  The status is still the same as mentioned on September 13, 2023.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour request is now #17 in the queue. I have approximately 148 pages responsive to your request.  This number may change after I finish my review. Please note, I work on requests on a first come first processed basis.  However, I will send you a partial response to you; hopefully, in the next two weeks. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMs. Michelle Moreno\r\n\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\n\r\nShe / Her / Hers\r\n\r\nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service\r\n\r\nLegislative and Public Affairs\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act and Privacy Act\r\n\r\n4700 River Road / Riverdale, MD 20737\r\n\r\nEmail: Michelle.Moreno@USDA.GOV\r\n\r\nPhone: (301) 851-4084\"",

You requested Production Support Requests (PSRs) created from 1/1/2023 to 12/31/2023.\r\nThe contract defines PSRs as service requests originating from issues reported by end users required to correct TIERS Suite of Applications data utilizing SQL scripts on the database. Based on this definition, the record count is more than 10,000 records which contain client Personally Identifiable Information/Protected Health Information and must be redacted.\r\n\r\nThe total estimated time to redact the records is over 500 hours, which would require a cost estimate of over $7,000. You can reduce the amount of review time and cost by narrowing your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  You requested Deloitte invoices for contract HHS000045800001 received from 1/1/2023 to 12/31/2023.\r\nSome invoices may include Deloitte's proprietary financial information which would need to be redacted. Would you be amenable to accepting redactions of Deloitte's proprietary financials? If so, you can review the redacted invoices and decide how you'd like to proceed.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to move forward without redacting Deloitte's proprietary financials, we would need to send the documents to the Office of Attorney General for a third party ruling, which generally takes 60-business days.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request for clarification extends the 10-business day deadline by 10 more business days, starting the day after we receive your clarification response. Your open records request will be considered withdrawn if we do not receive a clarification response from you within 61 days from the date of this email.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJennifer Ruffcorn\r\nHHS Office of Communications\r\nPress Officer\r\nPress Hotline: 512-424-6951\r\n\r\n[cid:image009.gif@01DA59E1.9C7E2F80]\r\n\r\n[cid:image010.png@01DA59E1.9C7E2F80]<http://www.facebook.com/TexasHHSC/>   [cid:image011.png@01DA59E1.9C7E2F80] <http://twitter.com/TexasHHSC>    [cid:image012.png@01DA59E1.9C7E2F80] <http://www.instagram.com/texashhsc/>    [cid:image013.png@01DA59E1.9C7E2F80] <http://www.youtube.com/user/TexasHHSC>    [cid:image014.png@01DA59E1.9C7E2F80] <https://www.facebook.com/txhhscenespanol/>    (en espa\u00f1ol)\n",

Redactions will be made to the documents according to the examples provided on Feb. 23.\r\n\r\nAs for the PSRs, as explained previously, the cost estimate is based on the number of PSR results (10,181) for the one-year time frame requested and the staff time (15-20 mins) required to review and redact each PSR for personal health information (PHI) made confidential by law (See Texas Medical Privacy Act<https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/HS/htm/HS.181.htm>). The calculation is based on standard prescribed by Texas Attorney General with the Public Information Cost Estimate Model<https://www2.texasattorneygeneral.gov/open/cost_calculator.php>.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request for clarification extends the 10-business day deadline by 10 more business days, starting the day after we receive your clarification response.

TEA received a public information request on May 23, regarding  documents and contracts with GoGuardian or Liminex that were active between 1/1/2018 and 5/23/2024. To the extent it exists, the requested information is provided to you with this letter and includes a copy of the original request.\r\n\r\nAttached are spreadsheets reflecting transactions of school district purchases where the districts requested a disbursement of their Instructional Materials and Technology Allotment. Note, TEA does not  maintain records at the state level beyond these transactions.  The contracts are between the school districts or local education agencies and the vendors.\r\n\r\nDistricts and open-enrollment charter schools can use their Instructional Materials and Technology Allotment<https://tea.texas.gov/academics/instructional-materials/2024-2025-instructional-materials-technology-allotment.pdf> (PDF) to order materials through EMAT. The funds can be accessed in two ways: through a requisition for state-adopted materials or through a disbursement request for materials ordered directly from the vendor.\r\nRequisition Process\r\n\r\n  1.  A local education agency (LEA) logs in to EMAT to submit a requisition for state-adopted materials.\r\n  2.  Funds are deducted from the LEA's allotment in EMAT.\r\n  3.  TEA reviews the requisition.\r\n  4.  If approved, TEA sends the order to the publisher. The publisher fulfills the order. TEA pays the publisher.\r\nDisbursement Process\r\n\r\n  1.  LEA logs into EMAT to submit a disbursement request.\r\n  2.  Funds are deducted from the LEA's allotment in EMAT.\r\n  3.  TEA reviews the request and contacts the LEA for additional information if needed.\r\n  4.  If approved, TEA sends the funds to the LEA. The LEA orders directly from the vendor and pays the vendor directly.\r\nTEA pays for interstate and intrastate shipping of instructional materials. Refer to the Freight Information page for shipping details.\r\nThese records represent a \"Disbursement Process\" by an LEA therefore no contact exists between TEA and the vendors.\r\nReferral to another governmental body: The district administrative offices, may have contract information related to your request.  A listing of school district contact information is available in the Texas Education Directory, linked here: http://tea4avholly.tea.state.tx.us/tea.askted.web/Forms/Home.aspx.\r\nThere are no charges for fulfilling this request and PIR # 69130 is considered closed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further, please contact me at (512) 463-3464 or by email at PIR@tea.texas.gov<mailto:PIR@tea.texas.gov>.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Logo  Description automatically generated]\r\nSherry Mansell\r\nPublic Information Coordinator\r\nOffice of General Counsel\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DABCD1.C0B64B50]\r\n512-463-3464\r\n[cid:image003.png@01DABCD1.C0B64B50]\r\npir@tea.texas.gov<mailto:pir@tea.texas.gov>\r\n[Icon  Description automatically generated]\r\nwww.tea.texas.gov<http://www.tea.texas.gov>\r\n\r\nSherry Mansell\r\nPublic Information Coordinator\r\n\r\nEnclosures:\r\n Original Request\r\n\r\n TEA Responsive Documents\n",

It will also assist in identifying potential areas for improvement in the examination process and contract oversight, ensuring that our veterans receive the proper evaluations they deserve while maximizing the efficient use of the VA's resources.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested information for the most recent fiscal year available. If possible, I would also appreciate data from the past three to five fiscal years to identify any trends or patterns in the annual costs associated with inadequate C&P examinations performed by contract agencies.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter and for your commitment to serving our nation's veterans. I look forward to your timely response.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMacKenzie Orcutt",

        "communication": "Good day,\r\n\r\nThis is in regards to your TSA FOIA request, 2021-TSFO-00418 (see attached). To search for records for this request, it would take a combined search time of 162 hours. We estimate costs of $4,536 for the continued processing of your request. In accordance with the DHS implementing regulations, 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11, fee estimates that exceed $250 may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. If you agree to this fee assessment, we are requesting an advance payment of fifty percent (50%) of the entire current anticipated fee which is $4,536.\r\n\r\nFee Estimate Breakdown:\r\nSearch time at $28 per hour (first two hours are free): $4,536\r\nProfessional review time at $28 per hour: no cost estimate at this time\r\nDuplication is .10 per page: no charge for electronic records\r\n\r\nThis is just an estimate. The final invoice will reflect the actual time expended which could be less than the estimate. If we expect the estimate amount to increase, we will contact you directly before incurring any additional fees. We will provide you with the final invoice with our final release of records.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, you may:\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Provide us with written assurance of your willingness to pay $4,536 for the processing of your request, or\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Agree in writing to pay some additional amount that is lower than our estimate of $4,536 for the processing of your request, and/or\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Reduce the scope of your request, so as to limit the amount of time that would be required to process your request, such that your fee does not exceed the amount that you have agreed to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive your fee agreement within 30 business days of the date of this email, which is June 28, 2021, we will administratively close out your requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like help reformulating your request, please contact me directly at Michael.tobias@tsa.dhs.gov<mailto:Michael.tobias@tsa.dhs.gov>. I am also available for phone meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response regarding your fee agreement by March 24, 2021.\r\n\r\nThank you and have a great day!\r\n\nMichael Tobias\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\r\nTransportation Security Administration (TSA)\r\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) Branch\r\nCRL/OTE/TED",

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\n\u00d6zal was born in Turkey and worked for the State Electrical Power Planning Administration from 1950 to 1952. He studied electrical energy and engineering management in the United States from 1952 to 1953, and returned to Turkey to work for the same government organization until 1958. \u00d6zal worked at the World Bank from 1971 to 1973, served as undersecretary to Prime Minister S\u00fcleyman Demirel from 1979 to 1980 and was appointed state minister and deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs from 1980 to 1982.\r\n\r\n\u1e26e founded the Motherland Party (Turkish: Anavatan Partisi) in 1983. \u00d6zal was elected Prime Minister of Turkey later that year, and served in that office until he became President of Turkey in 1989, later dying in office. \u00d6zal maintained close relations with U.S. President George H.W. Bush throughout the end of the Cold War and the beginning of the post Cold War era.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an investigative journalist who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, Reason Magazine, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",

Response:  An initial search indicates that well over three thousand documents may be responsive to this request, which it is estimated will take at least ten hours of staff time to retrieve and review to ensure that no statutory exceptions exist preventing the release or requiring the redaction of documents.  Pursuant to CORA, the first hour is free, and every hour thereafter is charged at $33.58 per hour, for an estimated minimum fee of $302.22.  Please provide payment to the City Clerk\u2019s Office of 50% of the estimated fee, or $151.11 to allow the City to begin processing your request.  The City is extending the time to respond to this request due to the extenuating circumstances, including the City having to devote all or substantially all of its resources to meeting an impending deadline concerning another CORA request, and the large volume of documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinda L.

When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.   You reference \u201canother FOIA request,\u201d and I am advising you that The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (FOIA) applies only to federal agencies and does not create a right of access to records held by local government agencies.  The City is processing your records request pursuant to the Colorado Open Records Act, C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-200.1, et seq. (CORA).  Please note that pursuant to C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-205(3), the City may charge a fee not in excess of the original fee charged to a previous person requesting the same or similar records.  The City\u2019s fees are set by a resolution approved by the City Council and all CORA requests are charged the same fee rate.\r\n\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.  The City\u2019s fees are set by a resolution approved by the City Council and all CORA requests are charged the same fee rate.  The City Council policy does not provide staff with discretion to charge a different fee for different requesting parties.  Electronic copies of records are not charged per page or per record, but rather the fee is based upon the time it takes the staff to research and retrieve the record, which fee is standard and is determined by the City Council by resolution.\r\n\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.  Neither CORA nor the City CORA policy require the City to consider the economic circumstances of the requesting party, and the City does not consider the use to which the requesting party will make of the requested records.\r\n\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified. As stated previously, FOIA is not applicable to the City of Cortez.  The City does not consider the use to which the requesting party will make of the requested records.\r\n\r\n3.

Request:  All external and internal documents, emails, minutes that reply to carpenter81321@protnmail.com<mailto:carpenter81321@protnmail.com> or contain the text \u2018Zu Gallery\u2019 from any staff, council or otherwise are subject to the Colorado Open Records Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Response:  An initial search indicates that over fourteen hundred documents may be responsive to this request, and it is estimated it will take City Staff at least nine hours of staff time to retrieve and review to ensure that no statutory exceptions exist preventing the release or requiring the redaction of documents.  Pursuant to CORA, the first hour is free, and every hour thereafter is charged at $33.58 per hour, for an estimated minimum fee for eight hours of $268.64.  If you still desire to have the City process this CORA request, please provide payment to the City Clerk\u2019s Office of 50% of the estimated fee, or $134.32 to allow the City to begin processing your request.  The City has extended the time to respond to this request due to the extenuating circumstances, including the City having to devote all or substantially all of its resources to meeting an impending deadline concerning another CORA request, and the large volume of documents involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinda L.

Pursuant to CORA, there is no charge for the first hour of time spent by the City retrieving and reviewing records, and all time thereafter is charged at $33.58 per hour.  This response required 10.08 hours of staff time, so minus the first hour, for which there is no charge, the total amount owed is $304.91.  You paid a deposit of $134.32, so the remaining balance owed is $170.59.  The total number of email records produced is 103, and the total number of attachment records produced is 45.  Please provide payment to the Cortez City Clerk in the amount of $170.59, and I will send you digital copies of all of the requested records.\r\n\r\n\r\nLinda L.

As stated in the Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance Factsheet,  \u201cFusion Centers are owned and operated by state and local entities with support from federal partners\u2026\u201d Given that Fusion Centers are intelligence hubs that gather, analyze and share sensitive information about citizens throughout the state and regions of Missouri, it is essential that the public can see accountability and transparency are prioritized in the day-to-day functions of organizations such as the St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group. \r\n\r\nRequested Documents/Records:\r\n\r\nI request that you provide me access to, or copies of: \r\n\r\n1.\tDocuments/records sufficient to show the name and location of the most current appointed custodian of records for the St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group. Please include the custodian\u2019s first/last name, title, physical location with room, street address, city, state, email address and direct phone number with extension.  \r\n\r\n2.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group\u2019s manual of all policies and procedures for processing Missouri Sunshine Law requests. If no manual exists, please provide all other guiding documentation/protocols for the processing of Missouri Sunshine Law requests.  \r\n\r\n3.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group\u2019s reasonably written policies (in compliance with sections 610.010 to 610.030, RSMo, commonly referred to as the Missouri Sunshine Law) that instructs members of the public on how to request access to public records that are held by the St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group.    \r\n\r\n4.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show why and how Missouri Sunshine Law public records requests that are addressed to the St Louis Fusion Center: Early Terrorism Early Warning Group, and clearly intended to be received and processed by the St Louis Fusion Center: Early Terrorism Early Warning Group are being diverted to the St Louis County Police Department and/or \u201cSt Louis County.\u201d    \r\n\r\n5.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show why and how Missouri Sunshine Law public records requests that are addressed to the St Louis Fusion Center: Early Terrorism Early Warning Group, and clearly intended to be received and processed by the St Louis Fusion Center: Early Terrorism Early Warning Group are being denied and closed by the St Louis County Police Department and/or \u201cSt Louis County\u201d for reasons of \u201cno documents responsive\u201d to the requests, when initial requests are not addressed to, sent to, or seeking documents from the St Louis County Police Department or \u201cSt Louis County.\u201d     \r\n\r\nRequested Format\r\n\r\nI am respectfully seeking all documents/records through MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply. \r\n\r\nI am requesting that documents/records be sent electronically, preferably as a PDF file attachment. I also request that documents/records be sent in any digital format in which they exist (such as PDF or Excel). If unable to fill the request electronically, please advise me of other alternatives.  \r\n\r\nPer Section 610.024, RSMo, \u201cIf a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the public governmental body shall separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for examination and copying.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf portions of the requested documents/records are closed due to exemption, please segregate the closed portions and provide me with all segregable portions of the documents/records. I also request that you please provide a detailed justification for each redaction or omission, and cite the specific exemption used for each redacted or omitted portion of the original document/records.   \r\n\r\nFee Waiver/Public Interest/Public Release\r\n\r\nAs the records sought detail the operations and activities of local and state government bodies, I also request that fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public\u2019s interest. I am seeking the records to analyze, inform and freely release to members of the public as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com. \r\n\r\nAs stated in Section 610.022, RSMo, \u201cpublic records shall be presumed to be open\u2026documents may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThe subject of the requested documents/records will provide significant increased insight about local and state governmental body\u2019s operations and/or activities around access to public records/documents. The requested records are not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nIf fees cannot be waived, I am willing to pay all reasonable duplication expenses incurred in the processing this Missouri Sunshine Law request. However, as I am a member of the public and requesting documents specifically for the purpose of increasing the public\u2019s knowledge of governmental functioning, I will administratively appeal any denial of my request for a fee waiver. If fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Hawkins",

Your request was received in this office on 5/12/2023.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records.

They also said:\r\n\r\n\"You may wish to direct your search to the New York City Office of Technology and Innovation\".\r\n\r\nHence, I am expecting relevant records from this agency.\r\n\r\nNow that more than two years have passed since I began this effort, I have considerably less patience for illegal delays. I wish to be as clear as I can be about this: I have no ill will whatsoever for the likely-overworked records access employees, but for the agencies which make it difficult to do your jobs in a timely manner. You may expect me to appeal on grounds of constructive denial should the request be illegally delayed.\r\n\r\nThe request for records, which I am now directing to this agency is:\r\nRecords relating to the total number of restaurants inspected for compliance with state pandemic air filtration and ventilating guidance.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed portable filtration or UVGI instead of MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that were operating the installed filtration or UVGI systems when inspected. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have other mitigation measures in place, when MERV 13 filtration, UVGI, and portable filtration, was not in place. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the number restaurants that have been found to be or are currently out of compliance with air filtration and ventilating guidance. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould no such records exist, I request information on what records and/or statistics are collected regarding air filtration and ventilating guidance enforcement.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, should they be available, records of the actual inspections and results.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I'm very glad to finally be getting real data - it's been three years of chasing various agencies to get this.\r\n\r\nI do have several questions.\r\n\r\nThe filename includes the word \"redacted\", but it's an excel spreadsheet, so I obviously can't see any markup. Can you tell me what's been redacted?\r\n\r\nAre there any descriptions or notes available in city records for the columns?\r\n\r\nWho was the records holder/owner for this dataset? Who was responsible for maintaining it.\r\n\r\nThere are easily tens of thousands of establishments for which many fields are empty. Is data missing? Have those fields been withheld?\r\n\r\nOne local establishment, the Beach Cafe on 2nd, has yes entries for symptom screening, soap, and many related surface sanitation checks, but empty fields for ventilation and filtration checks. I don't see a yes or no - just blank.\r\n\r\nSome establishments that should be in this dataset appear to be missing. I'm using my my favorite pizza place as a sanity check, pizza park on 1233 first avenue, and am struggling to find it. Is there any reason it would be missing or withheld?",

The spreadsheet is a record of various inspections performed by various agencies during the time period specified. OTI wasn't one of those agencies, so we don't have records of why any specific business was or was not inspected.\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nDominic",

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This would include but not be limited to reimbursements for mileage, gas, airfare, lodging, etc.\r\n\r\nDue to novel coronavirus emergency which requires so much teleworking in your agency as publicly stated repeatedly to this website, I think an overwhelming public interest exists in your spending and migration patterns.\r\n\r\nYour agency has expense disclosure transparency requirements based on The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act FFATA, and The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014, DATA in addition to FOIA.\r\n\r\nAs we have previously discussed sometimes these records are held within the Financial Management Division.\r\n\r\nBut please search any and all available indices/records areas that would be likely to contain the records sought.\r\n\r\nPlease produce the records in EFOIA Format .pdf document preferred.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWilliam Fernandes",

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact FOIA/PA Unit representative Fantasia L. Hogan-Bassey-Graham at (571) 776-2210 or via e-mail at Fantasia.L.Hogan-Bassey-Graham@dea.gov, our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public.\u00a0 You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

        "communication": "Dear William Fernandes:\r\n\u200b\r\n            This e-mail responds to your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) request dated April 2, 2022, received by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), FOIA/PA Unit, seeking access to DEA records.  Your request has been opened and assigned the following case number: 23-00303-F.  Please include this case number when communicating with this office.\r\n\r\nYour request as written does not meet the requirements of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(3)(A), since they do not reasonably describe records.  The Department of Justice rules, contained at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.3, provide that \u201cyou must describe the records in enough detail to enable department personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort\u201d and when possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought such as the date, title or name, author and subject matter of the record.  These specifics are important to determine the extent and scope of the search, and to determine the records that are responsive.  DEA can make certain presumptions to overcome some of the deficiencies in your request, but not all of them.\r\n\r\nTo retrieve the information that you may be seeking requires more specificity.  Under the FOIA, an agency is not required to conduct research.  DEA maintains several types of records and records systems (i.e., regulatory, personnel, investigative, etc.).  For example, in your letter, you are requesting Any and all expense records for travel into the State of Nevada for the period 2020.,\u201d yet you have not specified a particular DEA office that you wish searched; or the type of record that would be responsive to your request.  Be advised that DEA has 239 Domestic Offices in 23 Divisions throughout the United States, and 92 foreign offices in 69 countries, and more than 150 Headquarters Offices.  Since your description did not limit the search to a specific office or area, a vast majority of DEA offices would be tasked to conduct a search of their respective offices for any responsive records pertaining to the subject of your request.  As such, your request is overly broad and burdensome.\r\n\r\nPlease specify the following:\r\n\r\n  1.  Clarify the type of travel (TDY and/or Extended TDY travel)\r\n  2.  Verify the timeframe for \u201c2020\u201d (calendar year Jan-December or fiscal year Oct 2019 \u2013 Sept 2020)\r\n  3.  Do you also want the information to include the PCS travel when core employees move?\r\n\r\nTo this end, no further action will be initiated on this request until we are in receipt of the above documentation.  Upon receipt, we will conduct a query of the Investigative Reporting and Filing System (IRFS).  IRFS is the system of records that contains all administrative, general and investigative files compiled by DEA for law enforcement purposes.  If this office does not receive your response within 30 business days, DEA will assume that you do not wish to pursue this matter and your request will be administratively closed.  Please e-mail your response to fantasia.l.hogan-bassey-graham@dea.gov<mailto:fantasia.l.hogan-bassey-graham@dea.gov>.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with DEA\u2019s determination in response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website:  https://www.justice.gov/oip/submit-and-track-request-or-appeal.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request.  If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal.\"\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this email, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300.

The DEA offices continues to refuse to produce records in relation to spending and this was during the COVID peak.  \r\n\r\nAt this time the DEA was pandering to other law enforcement agencies (in CA) offering assistance to locate people, which is an advertisement that it did not have enough of its own work to do.  \r\n\r\nThe DOJ OIP refuses to govern the DEA about this which generally is a corruption indicator. Something in the expenses to be inspected. \r\n\r\nI also requested the OIP Background report, which the agency DEA obstructed and only, sent back a portion which was the appeal submitted.\r\n\r\nI think this agency should be defunded and its duties passed to DHS, CBO, FBI, HHS. \r\n\r\nRecords are available publicly here:\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/expenses-127054/\r\n",

It should noted that case sensitive searches are not possible, so the term \"Anonymous\" returns both references to the group \"Anonymous\" as well as any reference to anonymous tips, informants, etc. As we can't segregate between the two meanings of the word, USMS would have to manually review every single document just to identify the possibly responsive files. To that end, USMS would like to request that you narrow the scope of the request so that we can continue to process your request. One suggestion would be to remove the term \"Anonymous\" from the search terms and just proceed with variations of \"hack\" (which would include variations of hacker, hacktivist, hacktivism), but we are open to suggestions. \n\nYour request in currently being placed in a pending yourresponse.

As stated in the Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance Factsheet, \u201cFusion Centers are owned and operated by state and local entities with support from federal partners\u2026\u201d \r\n\r\nPer the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) website, \u201cThe Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) is recognized by the U. S. Department of Homeland Security as the Primary Fusion Center for the state of Missouri.\u201d \r\n\r\nGiven that Fusion Centers are intelligence hubs that gather, analyze and share sensitive information about citizens throughout the state and regions of Missouri, it is essential that the public can see accountability and transparency are prioritized in the day-to-day functions of organizations such as the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC).\r\n\r\nRequested Documents/Records:\r\n\r\nI request that you provide me access to, or copies of: \r\n\r\n1.\tDocuments/records sufficient to show the name and location of the most current appointed custodian of records for the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC). Please include the custodian\u2019s first/last name, title, physical location with room, street address, city, state, email address and direct phone number with extension.  \r\n\r\n2.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show the Missouri Information Analysis Center\u2019s manual of all policies and procedures for processing Missouri Sunshine Law requests. If no manual exists, please provide all other guiding documentation/protocols for the processing of Missouri Sunshine Law requests.  \r\n\r\n3.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show the Missouri Information Analysis Center\u2019s reasonably written policies (in compliance with sections 610.010 to 610.030, RSMo, commonly referred to as the Missouri Sunshine Law) that instructs members of the public on how to request access to public records that are held by the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC).\r\n\r\n4.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show why and how Missouri Sunshine Law public records requests that are addressed to the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), and clearly intended to be received and processed by the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), are being diverted to the Missouri State Highway Patrol.     \r\n\r\n5.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show why and how Missouri Sunshine Law public records requests that are addressed to the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), and clearly intended to be received and processed by the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), are being denied and closed by the Missouri State Highway Patrol for reasons of \u201cno documents responsive\u201d to the requests, when initial requests are not addressed to, sent to, or seeking documents from the Missouri State Highway Patrol. \r\n\r\nRequested Format\r\n\r\nI am respectfully seeking all documents/records through MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply. \r\n\r\nI am requesting that documents/records be sent electronically, preferably as a PDF file attachment. I also request that documents/records be sent in any digital format in which they exist (such as PDF or Excel). If unable to fill the request electronically, please advise me of other alternatives.  \r\n\r\nPer Section 610.024, RSMo, \u201cIf a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the public governmental body shall separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for examination and copying.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf portions of the requested documents/records are closed due to exemption, please segregate the closed portions and provide me with all segregable portions of the documents/records. I also request that you please provide a detailed justification for each redaction or omission, and cite the specific exemption used for each redacted or omitted portion of the original document/records.   \r\n\r\nFee Waiver/Public Interest/Public Release\r\n\r\nAs the records sought detail the operations and activities of local and state government bodies, I also request that fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public\u2019s interest. I am seeking the records to analyze, inform and freely release to members of the public as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com. \r\n\r\nAs stated in Section 610.022, RSMo, \u201cpublic records shall be presumed to be open\u2026documents may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThe subject of the requested documents/records will provide significant increased insight about local and state governmental body\u2019s operations and/or activities around access to public records/documents. The requested records are not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nIf fees cannot be waived, I am willing to pay all reasonable duplication expenses incurred in the processing this Missouri Sunshine Law request. However, as I am a member of the public and requesting documents specifically for the purpose of increasing the public\u2019s knowledge of governmental functioning, I will administratively appeal any denial of my request for a fee waiver. If fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Hawkins",

        "communication": "Dear Kevin Hawkins: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P050008-060524.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G. Callahan \r\nCustodian of Records",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Galante,\r\n\r\nReference is made to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request #1412777-000 for FBI records concerning File 062-HQ-62736, Postal Censorship.  The FBI has located approximately 83,000 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-100 page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing.  Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 134 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 523 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,335 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 1,875 days for processing.  \r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request large processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is June 2025.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  If you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please respond to this email.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n540-868-4894\r\nStatus check?

Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 138 days from the date of receipt for processing.

I am appealing all applied exemptions in the records provided, particularly the application of b7e to records that are, at the time of my receiving them, eighty-three years old. The Bureau has previously disclosed law enforcement and intelligence techniques of this era, to include the interception of privileged diplomatic communications and collaboration with allied foreign intelligence services, methods that at the time would be highly damaging if disclosed but currently hold no value by remaining secret. The exemptions as applied in this release strain credulity and are prima facie absurd. I appreciate your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPaul Galante",

Such documents may include but should not be limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of DoD and the cast, crew, and production company of the \"American Dreamer\" music video, including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nAttached is a list, released to me through FOIA by DoD, of TV and movie productions supported by DoD in 2023; \"Matt Tucker - American Dreamer\" is included on that list.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",
