Colonel Kristina Stanger, and Colonel Zach Nunn. These actions appear to constitute whistleblower retaliation and are connected to Regent Bruce Rastetter. This request also relates to my 2017 Iowa False Claims Act petition, which remains under seal, and my public letter to Polk County Attorney John Sarcone seeking civilian oversight of suspected misconduct. This misconduct includes the alleged misuse of MQ-9 Reaper drones for unreported \"pay-to-slay\" and \"drink-and-drone\" activities, which may not have been properly reported to the Polk County Medical Examiner.\r\n\r\nOctober 2023 PPE Donation:\r\nRecords regarding Governor Kim Reynolds' purported donation of a warehouse of personal protective equipment (PPE) to \"Israel\" in October 2023. I am requesting clarification on whether the PPE was defective and subsequently disposed of in an Illinois landfill, or if it was actually shipped to Israel.\r\n\r\nDisclosures by Intelligence Officer Zach Nunn:\r\nRecords related to intelligence officer Zach Nunn's disclosures to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and Iowa DOD, particularly regarding potential inconsistencies in his 2018 testimony to the Iowa House. Specifically, I request documentation of whether Nunn failed to disclose his wife Kelly Nunn\u2019s Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) income from China and Saudi Arabia via Brenna Bird\u2019s LS2Group.\r\n\r\nThese records are necessary to investigate potential misuse of public resources, transparency concerns, and compliance with ethical and legal standards by Iowa National Guard personnel and related entities.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Iowa Open Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am submitting this request for records under the Iowa Open Records Law (Iowa Code Chapter 22). This request relates to concerns regarding potential misuse of public funds, unauthorized attorney fees, and violations of legal and ethical responsibilities in cases involving the State of Iowa. Specifically, I am requesting:\r\n\r\nUnauthorized Private Attorney Fees under Iowa Code \u00a7 13.7\r\nRecords of all private attorney fees unauthorized under Iowa Code \u00a7 13.7 paid by Iowa Regents, their owned corporations, and institutions, as well as unaccounted payments under Iowa Code \u00a7 13.11 from State of Iowa settlement funds. This includes records from 2005, such as the $35,000 embezzled from the Iowa State University Foundation to Blouin for Governor via Belin McCormick attorneys Zumbach and Boykin.\r\nRelevant law firms include, but are not limited to, Daigle Law (admitted in April 2024 in the ISU Daily), Dentons Davis Brown (ISU Daily), Belin McCormick (ISU Foundation, ISU Research Park), Husch Blackwell (2018 ISU Daily admission), Nyemaster (Krapf v. Rastetter). Additional information may exist under seal and should be included as appropriate.\r\n\r\nFARA and LS2Group Incorporation by Belin McCormick\r\nRecords relating to the incorporation of LS2Group, a FARA-registered entity connected to Governor Counsel Bird. Specifically, I am requesting documentation of illegal funds funneled through Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.7 and 13.11 to Belin McCormick Law Firm, which incorporated LS2Group using funds passed via ISU Veterinary Services Corporation.\r\n\r\nUnauthorized Attorney Fees for Whistleblower Retaliation\r\nRecords of unauthorized private attorney fees paid by the City of Clive to Nyemaster and the City of Ankeny to Brick Gentry for matters relating to whistleblower retaliation following my May 15, 2024, whistleblower email to Senator Grassley. Note that your assistant Angela Studeman concealed this whistleblower email from the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board at their October 2024 meeting.\r\n\r\nState of Iowa Trial Exhibits in State v. Brewbaker (Polk 2019)\r\nCopies of all trial exhibits used in State v. Brewbaker (Polk 2019), which the Assistant Attorney General failed to file in the magistrate court EDMS system, obstructing my discretionary review and subsequent February 2020 PCR filing, which was never docketed in the district court due to wire fraud by the Polk County Clerk.\r\n\r\nMedicaid Billing for 2020 Detainment\r\nThe total amount billed to Iowa Medicaid during 2020 for my Iowa Code 229 involuntary detainment, during which I was defrauded of 812 credits in connection with the aforementioned case.\r\n\r\nAdmission of Embezzlements in 2022 Campaign Statements\r\nDocumentation related to Attorney General Bird\u2019s acknowledgment of embezzlements in her 2022 campaign, referred to as \"Tom Miller's slush fund,\" including the $1.8 million kickback received from RAGA through structured $30,000 donations by Husch Blackwell and Husch Blackwell Strategies (as documented in their IRS Form 990 filings). This information should be included in an amended Iowa False Claims Act 2024 annual report for oversight by the Iowa Senate along with information of Iowa Code 229 missing invoices to county auditors.\r\n\r\nAdditional Context:\r\nIt appears that the Iowa Fifth Judicial District Court Administrator removed your office from EDMS access to State ex rel Brewbaker v. Thomas John Miller (Polk 2017). Additionally, the State Court Administrator is reportedly violating a federal settlement agreement to no longer conceal basic case information, which includes records involving the Iowa Attorney General\u2019s Office.\r\n\r\nThis request aims to ensure compliance with Iowa Code and to enable proper oversight and accountability for public funds and legal processes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nChad Brewbaker",

Specifically, I am requesting:\r\n\r\nAggregate Medicaid Billing Records:\r\nThe total amount billed to Medicaid for my involuntary detention in the summer of 2020 by Polk County Hospital Broadlawns Medical Center and its contractor, UnityPoint Broadlawns Psych Education Foundation. These entities operate under contracts with Carlyle Group subsidiary Sedgwick, functioning as a \"Third-Party Administrator\" registered under the fictitious name Iowa Communities Insurance Pool (ICAP). ICAP provides coverage for local entities such as the City of Clive, City of West Des Moines, City of Urbandale, City of Waukee, Dallas County, and the City of Ankeny.\r\nThis request seeks to investigate potential Medicaid fraud tied to my detention, which I believe was political retaliation for whistleblowing activities. Public reports, including the case at https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/ia-court-of-appeals/2019420.html, indicate Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds received Sedgwick resources, including flights, to allegedly conceal Medicaid fraud.\r\n\r\nMissing Medicaid Involuntary Hospitalization Invoices:\r\nConfirmation of whether Medicaid invoices related to Iowa Code 229 involuntary hospitalizations, missing since approximately 2018, have been received by the Polk County and Dallas County Auditors.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Iowa Open Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am requesting records relating to the following matters. The requested records pertain to material disclosures by William Kelly, John Jarvey, and Stephen Locher that require correction in their ethics filings. These corrections are necessary so that litigants affected by these disclosures can take appropriate action to protect their liberty and property interests:\r\n\r\nUnauthorized Payments to Belin McCormick Law Firm from State of Iowa\r\nRecords of payments to the Belin McCormick Law Firm involving funds misappropriated under Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.7 and 13.11, originating from Iowa Board of Regents corporations. These include, but are not limited to, the $35,000 payment from the Iowa State University Foundation facilitated by Belin McCormick attorneys Zumbach and Boykin, which was subsequently directed to the Blouin for Governor Campaign in 2005 under Governor Tom Vilsack's administration (currently Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture). These payments were not disclosed by Hon. Stephen Locher, a shareholder of Belin McCormick, in his disclosures to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\nPayments to Belin McCormick on March 23, 2019\r\nRecords of payments exceeding $10,000 made to the Belin McCormick Law Firm by the Iowa GOP on or about March 23, 2019. These payments were not disclosed by firm shareholder Hon. Stephen Locher and are connected to an \"annoying speech\" warrant signed by his wife, Polk County Judge Sarah Crane. The warrant was based on a solitary SMS message referencing e-notary regulatory capture related to Doug Strawn's firm, LenderClose, sent to the registered agent and attorney for Flying Access Residuals LLC, which held a lending automation patent application under review by the USPTO.\r\n\r\nPayments to U.S. Judge John Jarvey\r\nRecords of annual payments from the State of Iowa to U.S. Judge John Jarvey, facilitated by Dana Oxley. These payments were not disclosed by Judge Jarvey in filings with the U.S. Court Administration or the Iowa Judicial Nominating Commission by Justice Oxley.\r\n\r\nPayments to William Kelly's Dentons Davis Brown Firm\r\nRecords of payments to William Kelly's firm, Dentons Davis Brown, involving funds misappropriated under Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.7 and 13.11 from Iowa Board of Regents corporations (e.g., ISU Daily). These payments were not disclosed by William Kelly in ethics filings with the Iowa Judicial Nominating Commission or U.S. Courts during his application process. Reference is made to the Iowa Bar Association article tying Bruce Rastetter's attorney of record, Leslie Behaunek, to JAG William Kelly and JAG Lucas Sterbick, who prosecuted the warrant signed by Judge Sarah Crane in 2019. [Link in support: https://www.iowabar.org/?pg=IowaLawyerMagazine&pubAction=viewIssue&pubIssueID=36019&pubIssueItemID=209236] Kelly further needs to disclose an estimated $20,000 of fraudulent Medicaid invoices he caused in summer of 2020 as alleged whistleblower retaliation. Kelly's quashing of Wellpath pharmacy fraud/abuse subpoenas related to US DHS ICE pharmacy contracts in November 2019 is public and can be added to his file.\r\n\r\nThe requested records are critical to ensuring compliance with ethics requirements and to allow litigants whose cases were affected by these undisclosed material relationships to take necessary steps to protect their liberty and property interests.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nChad Brewbaker",

(Per Attorney General Garland\u2019s March 15, 2022 memorandum, \u201cIn case of doubt [regarding foreseeable harm or legal bar to disclosure], openness should prevail.\u201dWe therefore request that if the agency determines that an exemption applies, specific reasons be provided as to why disclosure would harm any interest protected by such exemption. An agency shall also \u201cconsider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible\u201d and \u201ctake reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii). We therefore request that the agency release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your reply within the FOIA-specified timeframe of 20 working days. Please let us know if there are any clarifications we can make to make this request easier and/or quicker to complete.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nAdrian Nesta",

We cannot provide DOB due to privacy concerns, as it is sensitive personal information that we are not authorized to disclose.\u2026\r\n\r\nMy question is about the other items: appointment date, start date, and end date.\r\n\r\nAre you asking for our current list of employees who are currently in their position and their start date? The end date would not be provided if they are still in their respective positions.\r\n\r\nWe have employees who started as clerks back in 2021 and have since moved to other positions and, in some cases, to departments outside our agency.\r\n\r\nSo, if I may ask, what does the date range entail exactly, as it correlates with the start date and end date as well?  We have employees who started their careers before January 2021, and some left the Human Services Agency before January 2021, and some left between January 2021 to December 4, 2024.\r\n\r\nI am available to discuss this over the phone if that helps. My direct line is 415-503-4889, and my hours are 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Pacific time.\r\n\r\nI believe a conversation could help us clarify the details more effectively.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nKen Pang\r\nAssistant Custodian of Records\r\nHuman Services Agency \u2013 Investigations\r\nCity and County of San Francisco\r\n1650 Mission St. Suite 500  San Francisco, CA 94103\r\nT. 415.503.4889 | F. 415.503.4827\r\nAll Sunshine/Public Records requests should be sent to THIS address, HSASunshine@sfgov.org<mailto:HSASunshine@sfgov.org>.\n",
