Under the amended Public Officers Law/Freedom of Information Law, records now subject to release under the state's Freedom of Information Law (effective immediately) include:\r\n\r\n* complaints, allegations, and charges against an employee;\r\n* the name of the employee complained of or charged;\r\n* the transcript of any disciplinary trial or hearing, including any exhibits introduced at such trial or hearing;\r\n* the disposition of any disciplinary proceeding;\r\n* the final written opinion or memorandum supporting the disposition and discipline imposed including the agency's complete factual findings and its analysis of the conduct and appropriate discipline of the covered employee.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJake Offenhartz",
