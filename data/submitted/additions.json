This should include any references to journalists reporting on Leqembi by FDA agency staff whether or not the communication includes an employee of Eisai or Biogen.\"  \r\n\r\nSince my prior request is far more detailed, I'm asking for the biannual reports  separately as I believe this could be more rapidly fulfilled via an expedited request since the safety of lecanemab and associated deaths are currently a significant source of concern among many researchers and the press . I am therefore requesting expedited handling of this limited request. \r\n\r\nI am a professional journalist writing for The BMJ. \r\n \r\nAs an investigative journalist, I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this FOIA request and duplicating responsive records.  \r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nJeanne Lenzer\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJeanne Lenzer",
