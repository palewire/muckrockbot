        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Vermont Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI respectfully request records held by the Vermont Department of State\u2019s Attorneys and Sheriffs concerning the investigation and its resolution involving a property in Stamford, Vermont, as chronicled in the Rolling Stone article titled \"The Ezra Miller Saga Now Involves Vermont\u2019s Child Services Department\" (published August 10, 2022, available at: https://web.archive.org/web/20241215093133/https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/ezra-miller-vermont-child-services-department-1392572/).\r\n\r\nThe article details attempts by Vermont State Police to serve an emergency care order on August 6, 7, and 9, 2022, at Ezra Miller\u2019s 96-acre farm in Stamford, intended to remove a 25-year-old mother and her three children amid supposed welfare concerns, with oversight by the Vermont Department for Children and Families (DCF) and involvement of state\u2019s attorney(s) in legal proceedings or service efforts. \r\nMost notably, the article includes information or statements attributed to the State Attorney\u2019s Office suggesting the property owner was attempting to \"evade\" the order or \"shield\" someone (quote: \"the Vermont State Attorney\u2019s office said seemed like an attempt to \u201cevade service\u201d of the order, according to the court document obtained by Rolling Stone.\")\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I seek the following from August 1, 2022, through December 31, 2023:\r\n\r\n- All documents related to the emergency care order & its investigation & service, including reports, logs, court documents, affidavits, field notes,  incident reports, warrants, summonses, etc from the Department of State\u2019s Attorneys and Sheriffs coordinating or documenting attempts from Vermont State Police to serve it on August 6, 7, and 9, 2022, or any later efforts, concerning the mother and her children\u2019s welfare. This includes records of challenges (e.g., access issues or alleged evasion) and outcomes (e.g., successful service, withdrawal, alternative resolutions, etc), as well as any internal reviews or supervisory notes regarding the handling of the case.\r\n\r\n- Correspondence (e.g., emails, memos, letters, texts, call logs, etc) between the Department of State\u2019s Attorneys and Sheriffs, Vermont State Police, Vermont DCF, or other judicial personnel regarding this emergency care order, its investigation, its execution, or its resolution, as well as legal filings, opinions, or court documents prepared by state\u2019s attorneys\u2014such as the order\u2019s application, welfare concern justifications, or filings for the hearing(s) referenced in the article\u2014including any records reflecting the \"evasion\" or \"shielding\" claim and/or an apparent pending hearing referenced in the Rolling Stone article scheduled on or after August 10, 2022 (quote: \"A hearing is scheduled for the matter later this week.\"), along with any drafts, amendments, or annotations to these legal documents.\r\n\r\n- Documentation of inter-agency coordination with Vermont State Police, Vermont DCF, or other entities (including out-of-state agencies) about the welfare of the mother and children or the order\u2019s execution, including meeting notes, disposition records, situation reports, inter-agency referrals, or child welfare assessments (e.g., risk or safety evaluations)\u2014and if any responsive records are held by other agencies (including out-of-state), I request disclosure to ensure all relevant documents are obtained, including any chain-of-custody records for evidence or information shared between agencies.\r\n\r\nI request that any exempt personal information (e.g., names of minors or private individuals) be redacted rather than withholding any documents entirely, consistent with the Vermont Public Records Act\u2019s presumption of disclosure (1 V.S.A. \u00a7 315 et seq.).\r\nI am not affiliated with any news agencies & this request is not being made for commercial purposes. This inquiry serves the public interest by shedding light on the resolution of a widely publicized matter (yet for some reason never followed up on by news organizations) involving child welfare and inter-agency action, fostering transparency in governmental proceedings, and discouraging vigilante justice from members of the public who, due to rampant disinformation by omission, might be inclined to take matters into their own hands against a perceived child abductor.\r\nIf there are any issues with the scope or specificity of this request, please contact me to discuss it before denying or delaying the response.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nBureau records related to my great-great grandfather Paul Douglas McRoy (born November 8th 1869 - died September 18th 1950 in Meridian, Mississippi). McRoy was a newspaper journalist who wrote for the Meridian Star and Meridian Dispatch newspapers. He was also editor of sole publisher of a publication called \"The Truth\" in the 1930s and 40s. . McRoy was also a member of the Meridian, Mississippi school board. Attached is a copy of his obituary. An obituary described him as being, \"one of the most accurate-ethical newspaper men in state history.\"\r\n\r\nOf particular interest would be any bureau records related to articles he wrote - specifically any about crime, politics or the bureau itself - in the MERIDIAN STAR or MERIDIAN DISPATCH newspapers. Of additional interest would be bureau documents related to his \"The Truth\" publication. \r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search for any correspondence from Paul Douglas McRoy to J. Edgar Hoover, Clyde Tolson, or any other bureau employee. Please conduct a search for J. Edgar Hoover correspondence that mentions McRoy or articles that he published. \r\n\r\nThis is for records about Paul Douglas McRoy from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Ashe held by the Jackson, Mississippi field office. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Paul Douglas McRoy. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Paul Douglas McRoy. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or certain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
