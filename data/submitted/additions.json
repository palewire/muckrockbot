I ask for the complete database with one row per ticket and all releasable metadata fields, including the date, location, violation type and recipient.\r\n\r\nThis should include, but not be limited to, the type of violations enforced during last fall's \"Operation Safe Harvest\", which was documented in this news story. https://www.localsyr.com/news/dec-has-written-nearly-150-tickets-this-hunting-season-in-new-york/amp/?fbclid=IwAR0OLo4oGyZ2duzrmni8AUWV5TtkcJ1FW-wGswi4hwN2jovY1GSgsU7AIVs\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Welsh",
