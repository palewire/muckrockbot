Trump\u2019s first administration (January 20, 2017 \u2013 January 20, 2021), focusing on efforts to manage public and media perceptions of the administration:\r\n\r\n1. Internal Communications About Media Strategy\r\n\t\u2022\tEmails, memoranda, or other internal communications between OMB officials and White House staff discussing:\r\n\t\u2022\tMedia strategies to manage public perception of President Trump following controversial statements or actions.\r\n\t\u2022\tInstructions to federal agencies on how to align messaging with Trump\u2019s narrative, including framing him as a victim of \u201cfake news.\u201d\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), emphasizes FOIA\u2019s purpose to inform the public about government operations, particularly those involving media influence and public communication strategies.\r\n\r\n2. Communications with Media Outlets\r\n\t\u2022\tAll communications between OMB staff and representatives of media outlets (e.g., CNN, Fox News, New York Times, etc.), including:\r\n\t\u2022\tGuidance or suggestions regarding how Trump\u2019s public persona should be portrayed.\r\n\t\u2022\tReactions to specific media coverage of Trump or his administration.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 857 F. Supp. 2d 44 (D.D.C. 2012), highlights the public\u2019s right to understand government coordination with external entities, including the media.\r\n\r\n3. Press Interaction Planning\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords related to planning and execution of press interactions after controversial actions or statements, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tTalking points, briefing materials, or Q&A documents prepared for Trump or senior officials to address the press.\r\n\t\u2022\tMedia strategies specifically designed to counteract \u201cfake news\u201d narratives.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: In American Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011), the court affirmed FOIA\u2019s role in providing transparency on government strategies that influence public discourse.\r\n\r\n4. Instructions to Federal Agencies\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of directives, guidance, or policies sent by OMB to federal agencies about aligning public communications with Trump\u2019s media narrative, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tFraming Trump as a victim of media bias.\r\n\t\u2022\tStrategies for projecting strength and competence in response to critical media coverage.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), reinforces that records related to public-facing strategies are subject to disclosure under FOIA.\r\n\r\n5. Analysis or Reports on Media Coverage\r\n\t\u2022\tReports, summaries, or internal analyses compiled by OMB about media coverage of Trump and his administration, including assessments of how specific outlets covered controversies or key events.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146 (1989), supports FOIA\u2019s goal of exposing government analysis and efforts to shape public perception.\r\n\r\nRelevance to Public Interest\r\n\r\nThis request is of significant public interest, as the requested records would provide insight into how a sitting administration used government resources to influence media coverage, shape public perception, and project a carefully managed narrative. Public understanding of such efforts is critical to evaluating transparency and accountability in government.\r\n\r\nSegregability of Non-Exempt Portions\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the requested records is deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions, as required by Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). Agencies must provide detailed justifications for withheld information, including an exemption log.\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records\r\n\r\nPlease note your legal obligation to preserve all potentially responsive records. Any destruction of such records without proper justification constitutes a violation of FOIA\u2019s statutory requirements.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nAs an independent investigative journalist with Transparency Report, I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of the requested information serves the public interest by significantly enhancing public understanding of government operations during a historic presidency. This request is not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Cause of Action v. FTC, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015), supports the granting of fee waivers for requests that contribute to public understanding of significant governmental actions.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $200 for processing fees and request prior notification if costs exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), as this request pertains to an issue of significant and continuing public interest involving government accountability, media influence, and public perception of transparency.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records in electronic format where possible. As stipulated by FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days. If any part of this request is unclear, please contact me at Jordan@Lassiter.eu for clarification.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter",

Additionally, it includes any relevant metadata, logs, and supporting documentation.\r\n\r\nThe request also seeks access to after-action and pre-action reports prepared in connection with the events of January 6, 2021. Given the ongoing congressional hearings and investigations into these events, the records are critical to public interest, government accountability, and public safety.\r\n\r\n1. Text Message Communications\r\n\t\u2022\tAll text messages sent or received by U.S. Secret Service personnel, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tAgents assigned to President Trump\u2019s and Vice President Pence\u2019s security details.\r\n\t\u2022\tCommunications regarding Trump\u2019s potential movements, including plans or discussions about traveling to the Capitol.\r\n\t\u2022\tMessages discussing security threats to the Capitol, members of Congress, or Vice President Pence as the events unfolded.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), affirms the public\u2019s right to access records related to government accountability and transparency.\r\n\r\n2. Phone Call Metadata, Logs, and Wire Communications\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords of phone calls and wire communications made or received by Secret Service personnel, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tLogs and metadata (timestamps, durations, and recipients) for calls discussing security threats, coordination, and protective actions.\r\n\t\u2022\tCall summaries or notes related to Trump\u2019s potential travel to the Capitol or other significant movements.\r\n\t\u2022\tThis includes records of any encrypted or secure line communications.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Milner v.

Emails, Radio Transmissions, and Encrypted Messaging\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of all emails, encrypted communications (e.g., Signal, WhatsApp, or other secure apps), and radio transmissions sent or received by Secret Service personnel during the specified timeframe, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal discussions regarding security measures at the Capitol on January 6.\r\n\t\u2022\tCommunications about Trump\u2019s potential movements or orders to accompany him to the Capitol.\r\n\t\u2022\tCoordination with other agencies, such as the FBI, Capitol Police, and the Department of Defense.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 857 F. Supp. 2d 44 (D.D.C. 2012), highlights the need for transparency in interagency communications during critical events.\r\n\r\n4.

U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011), supports public access to government records documenting significant public safety events.\r\n\r\n5. After-Action and Pre-Action Reports\r\n\t\u2022\tAny after-action reports created by the U.S. Secret Service analyzing the events of January 6, 2021, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tSecurity lapses, failures, and vulnerabilities.\r\n\t\u2022\tAssessments of agent responses and decisions made during the insurrection.\r\n\t\u2022\tRecommendations for future operations or improvements.\r\n\t\u2022\tAny pre-action reports or assessments, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tPreparations for Trump\u2019s and Pence\u2019s security on January 6.\r\n\t\u2022\tThreat assessments or intelligence briefings regarding risks to Congress, the Capitol, or federal officials.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: These reports are critical for public accountability. John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146 (1989), highlights FOIA\u2019s intent to shed light on government operations.\r\n\r\n6. Deleted or Missing Records\r\n\t\u2022\tDocumentation regarding any deleted or missing records (e.g., text messages, emails, wire communications) related to January 6, 2021, including justifications or efforts to recover such records.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: FOIA\u2019s transparency principles, as reinforced by Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), require agencies to account for missing or withheld records.\r\n\r\n7. Interagency Communications\r\n\t\u2022\tAll communications between the Secret Service and other federal, state, or local agencies during the specified timeframe, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tFBI, Capitol Police, and Department of Defense communications.\r\n\t\u2022\tInteragency discussions about Trump\u2019s or Pence\u2019s security concerns.\r\n\t\u2022\tCollaborative updates or plans for managing the escalating events at the Capitol.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Interagency communications fall within FOIA\u2019s scope, as established in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Department of Energy, 412 F.3d 125 (D.C. Cir. 2005).\r\n\r\nRelevance to Public Interest\r\n\r\nThis request is of urgent public interest due to the ongoing congressional hearings, investigations, and widespread public concern regarding the January 6, 2021, events. The requested records pertain to national security, public safety, and the transparency of federal agency operations. As established in Al-Fayed v. CIA, 254 F.3d 300 (D.C. Cir. 2001), FOIA requests addressing compelling public interest deserve expedited processing.\r\n\r\nSegregability of Non-Exempt Portions\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the requested records is deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions, as required by Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). Agencies must provide detailed justifications for withheld information, including an exemption log.\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records\r\n\r\nPlease note your legal obligation to preserve all potentially responsive records. Any destruction of such records without proper justification constitutes a violation of FOIA\u2019s statutory requirements.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nAs an independent investigative journalist with Transparency Report, I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of the requested information serves the public interest by significantly enhancing public understanding of government operations during a historic and critical event. This request is not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Cause of Action v. FTC, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015), supports the granting of fee waivers for requests that contribute to public understanding of significant governmental actions.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $200 for processing fees and request prior notification if costs exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), as this request pertains to an issue of significant and continuing public interest involving national security, public safety, and government accountability.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records in electronic format where possible.

Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), emphasizes FOIA\u2019s purpose of informing the public about \u201cwhat their government is up to,\u201d supporting the transparency of technical records.\r\n\t2.\tTesting and Evaluation Reports:\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords documenting testing and evaluations of the TF39 engine to assess performance, safety, and operational efficiency.\r\nLegal Basis: Department of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352 (1976), establishes that exemptions must be narrowly construed to uphold FOIA\u2019s goal of public access.\r\n\t3.\tProcurement Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tContracts, agreements, or procurement documentation between the Department of Defense, the Air Force, and General Electric relating to the TF39 engine.\r\nLegal Basis: In Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), the Court ruled that information unrelated to internal personnel rules is not exempt under FOIA Exemption 2.\r\n\t4.\tMaintenance Protocols and Standards:\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords outlining maintenance standards, procedures, and guidelines for the operation and upkeep of the TF39 engine.\r\nLegal Basis: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 857 F. Supp. 2d 44 (D.D.C. 2012), reaffirms that agencies bear the burden of justifying nondisclosure of requested materials.\r\n\t5.\tInteragency Communications and Collaboration:\r\n\t\u2022\tCorrespondence between the Air Force, DoD, and General Electric, including internal memoranda or communications about the TF39 engine\u2019s development, maintenance, and eventual retirement.\r\nLegal Basis: Disclosure of interagency communications is supported by John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146 (1989), where the Court emphasized FOIA\u2019s intent to reveal \u201cthe workings of the government.\u201d\r\n\t6.\tDeclassified Records of C-5 Galaxy and TF39 Engine Upgrades or Modifications:\r\n\t\u2022\tAny records reflecting upgrades or modifications to the TF39 engine or C-5 Galaxy since their initial production, including performance improvements and eventual transition to newer systems.\r\nLegal Basis: In American Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011), the court mandated disclosure of declassified records to promote FOIA\u2019s transparency objectives.\r\n\r\nSegregability of Non-Exempt Portions\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the requested records is deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions, as required by Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). Agencies must provide detailed justifications for withheld information, including an exemption log.\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records\r\n\r\nPlease note your legal obligation to preserve all potentially responsive records. Any destruction of such records without proper justification constitutes a violation of FOIA\u2019s statutory requirements.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nAs an independent investigative journalist with Transparency Report, I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of the requested information serves the public interest by significantly enhancing public understanding of military aviation technology and government operations. This request is not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Under Cause of Action v. FTC, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015), fee waivers must be granted for requests that contribute to public understanding of government activities.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $200 for processing fees and request prior notification if costs exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) because the requested information pertains to matters of significant public interest involving national defense and advancements in military aviation.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: In Al-Fayed v. CIA, 254 F.3d 300 (D.C. Cir. 2001), the Court recognized the need for expedited processing for issues of compelling public interest.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records in electronic format where possible. As stipulated by FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days. If any part of this request is unclear, please contact me at Jordan@Lassiter.eu for clarification.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Department of State (DOS) records, documents, and communications responsive to Project Brain Wave, aka Operation Brain Wave. This was a program proposed and implemented by the DOS between 1950 and 1955. An undated memorandum sent by someone within the DOS to the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council states: \"10. 'Project Brain Wave'. The Department of State is developing and has reported to the Board a project designed to stimulate display of indigenous anti-Communist sentiment in the countries of Western Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThis memorandum is number 57 in a group of memos declassified by the DOS and can be found on page 109 of a document made accessible at: https://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/96783.pdf.\r\n\r\nAfter this memorandum was sent, someone associated with the Office of International Information and Educational Exchange Programs, Bureau of Public Affairs sent or received an undated draft memorandum, written at some point between January 1, 1951 and December 31, 1952, titled \"Implementation of Operation Brain Wave\".  This document, attached, states as follows: \"I recommend that steps be taken to form a private foundation or organization with an appropriate title, which would in effect be usable as a direct arm of the State Department, which could be used to channel ideas to, and which would on its own initiative promote projects consistent with our objectives in a given country; an organization so eminently respectable that, in the conduct of projects, even though supported financially by the Department of State, the hand of the Department need not appear at all. Such organization could recruit and send people to Europe for example to get Operation Brain Wave underway.\"\r\n\r\nThis draft memorandum can be found at the National Archives and Record Administration, Archives II, College Park, Maryland, and its catalog information can be found at: https://catalog.archives.gov/id/3857396.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Information about Project/Operation Brain Wave has been declassified previously, as shown in the two examples provided above, and additional information about this program might help clarify the role of the DOS in managing tensions during the Cold War. The attached draft memo which references the creation of a \"private foundation or organization\" later identifies this entity as a \"front organization.\" During the Cold War, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) established such an organization, the Congress for Cultural Freedom, and it carried out many of the same functions described in the draft memo. Clarifying any overlap between DOS and CIA activities can help historians, journalists, and lay scholars in better contextualizing the Cold War for the public.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Mr. Hurkos was a Dutch immigrant and psychic who maintained a public profile between the years of 1956 and 1988. During this period, he claimed to have extrasensory perception and that he used this ability to assist law enforcement on cases ranging from the arrest of Albert DeSalvo, aka the Boston Strangler, to Charles Manson.

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to CONBRIBE (58-5205). \r\n\r\nAt least two prior requests have been made for these records: on July 11, 2011, the FBI opened FOIPA request number 1169380-000, for \"CONBRIBE (1963 & PRIOR)\",  and on August 22, 2020, it opened FOIPA request number 1292493-000, for \"CONBRIBE - Nationalities Intelligence\". The CONBRIBE records deal with Congressional bribery investigations handled by the FBI. CONBRIBE was assigned a Bureau file number of 58-5205.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media.

In addition to the prior FOIPA requests, which demonstrate a continuing public interest in the subject, the CONBRIBE records involve investigations into public corruption targeting members of Congress by foreign agents. These investigations, and their outcomes, would contribute greatly to public understanding of how, historically, the FBI has handled investigations into public officials, especially with regard to the involvement of foreign nations and their agents, along with providing insight into attempts by foreign nationals to influence American officials. There should be no concerns for public privacy or ongoing investigations, as most, if not all of the subjects are now deceased; CONBRIBE investigations occurred during the 1950s and 1960s.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100.

Mr. Parris, who went by numerous aliases and pseudonyms including \"Professor de Herbert\" and \"Professor Uriah Konje\" was a Barbadian-born, Harlem-based writer of mystic numerology. Born in 1893, died in 1973. \r\n\r\nIn May of 2022, \"The Success Dream Book\" was banned from distribution to the prison population of the Clinton Correctional Facility in New York State. \r\n\r\nParris published numerous books including \r\nThe H.P. Dream Book (as Professor Uriah Konje)\r\nThe Combination Dream Book \r\nThe Lucky Star Dream Book\r\n\r\nThe publication of these materials made Parris an exceptionally wealthy Afro-Caribbean in New York by the late 1930s. Parris pontificated in his writings about the Ku Klux Klan and Marcus Garvey. According to information online, Parris hired FBI informant HERBERT S. BOULIN as an employee. There is likely to be agency documentation related to Parris in files related to: the Ku Klux Klan, Marcus Garvey, Herbert S. Boulin. \r\n\r\nMore information about Herbert Gladstone Parris and his affiliation with FBI information Herbert S. Boulin can be found here: https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/67/vandegrift.php\r\nMore information about his birth and death can be found here: https://www.luckymojo.com/professorkonje.html\r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about Herbert Gladstone Parris from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Herbert Gladstone Parris held by the New York, Philadelphia or Washington field offices. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Herbert Gladstone Parris. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases (\"Professor de Herbert\"), nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms (\"Professor Uriah Konje\") or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Herbert Gladstone Parris. \r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Herbert Gladstone Parris. \r\n\r\nThank you for the bureau's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working together on this request, no matter how long it takes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This request includes records addressing allegations of systemic constitutional violations, ADA non-compliance, whistleblower retaliation, and associated governance issues.\r\n\r\nScope of Request\r\nComplaint Review and Processing:\r\n\r\nAll internal records, including memos, emails, meeting notes, decision logs, and evaluations, documenting the review and disposition of complaint #542283-VPS.\r\nAny workflows or internal task assignments related to this complaint, including timelines and responsible personnel.\r\nExternal and Interagency Communications:\r\n\r\nCorrespondence between DOJ and external entities, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Connecticut Attorney General\u2019s Office, and other federal or state agencies concerning the subject matter of the complaint.\r\nInteragency directives or advisories relating to oversight or collaboration on systemic issues identified in the complaint.\r\nPolicy, Procedure, and Action Records:\r\n\r\nDocumentation of DOJ protocols, policies, or operational guidelines used in assessing, addressing, or dismissing complaint #542283-VPS.\r\nRecords of enforcement actions, case follow-ups, or formal referrals stemming from the complaint.\r\nPersonnel Involvement:\r\n\r\nIdentification of all DOJ personnel involved in processing or overseeing this matter, including their roles, decision-making authority, and communication logs.\r\nLegal and Procedural Basis:\r\n\r\nAny legal analyses, internal opinions, or statutory references justifying the decision communicated to me in your letter dated December 2, 2024, indicating no further action would be taken.\r\nSupporting documentation outlining the DOJ's compliance with whistleblower protection standards, ADA obligations, and constitutional governance in this decision.\r\nADA and Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nAll DOJ records, policies, and communications addressing ADA accommodations or whistleblower protections as applied in this case.\r\nDocumentation of any DOJ awareness, training, or application of ADA-compliant processes related to this complaint.\r\nAccommodations Previously Requested\r\nThe following accommodations, explicitly outlined in prior communications, remain unfulfilled:\r\n\r\nExclusive Use of MuckRock Platform\r\n\r\nRequested: All communications must be routed exclusively through the MuckRock platform. No external portals, password-protected links, or alternate communication methods are acceptable.\r\nNon-Compliance: Communications have directed me to use external portals and password-protected links, violating ADA guidelines and my explicit requests.\r\nAccessible Document Formatting\r\n\r\nRequested: All documents must be provided as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed for ease of navigation and accessibility.\r\nNon-Compliance: Provided documents have not adhered to accessibility standards, preventing effective access to critical information.\r\nSimplified Summaries for Complex Records\r\n\r\nRequested: Simplified summaries must accompany all complex or technical records to enhance comprehension and ensure equitable participation.\r\nNon-Compliance: No summaries have been provided, creating unnecessary barriers to understanding the records.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nRequested: Each communication must include the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for processing or responding to my requests.\r\nNon-Compliance: Correspondence has consistently lacked this information, hindering accountability and effective follow-up.\r\n\r\nImmediate Action Required\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\nGiven the significant public interest in transparency regarding whistleblower retaliation, ADA compliance, and constitutional violations, expedited processing is requested under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Immediate access to these records is essential to addressing ongoing harm and systemic governance issues.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nAs this request is made in the public interest and not for commercial purposes, I request a fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of these records will contribute substantially to public understanding of government operations and decision-making.\r\n\r\nDeadline and Compliance Expectations\r\nI anticipate your acknowledgment of this request within the statutory 20 business days and fulfillment of the request without undue delay. Any refusal to provide responsive records must be accompanied by a detailed justification citing specific statutory exemptions.\r\n\r\nFailure to comply with FOIA obligations or provide the requested accommodations will necessitate escalation through administrative appeals, formal complaints to oversight bodies, and judicial remedies.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nDB.42.131.Inf.\r\nABI Resources https://www.ctbraininjury.com/blog/tags/db-42-131-inf https://x.com/ABIresources/status/1866212331279339765 https://www.youtube.com/@ABI.RESOURCES-CT-ABI-MFP-CARE/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=2\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\r\nConnecticut Attorney General\u2019s Office\r\nRelevant Congressional Oversight Committees\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
