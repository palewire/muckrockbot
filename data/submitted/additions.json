Will that really happen?\u201d Bondi responded: \u201cIt is sitting on my desk right now to review. That has been a directive by President Trump. I am reviewing that.\u201d  You can see the full interview here: https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bondi-says-epstein-client-list-sitting-my-desk-right-now-reviewing-jfk-mlk-files\r\n\r\nI seek all of the Epstein-related records that Bondi was referring to during this interview appearance, including the document or documents she was referring to when she stated \"It is sitting on my desk right now to review.\" This request also seeks the \"list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients\" that Bondi was asked about by the Fox News reporter and confirmed having in her possession during the interview appearance.\r\n\r\nI do not seek a copy of the publicly available list of Epstein's associates that was unsealed by a judge in 2024 in a civil lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell, and which is described in this CBS News article: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-list-associates-unsealed-judge-rules/\r\n\r\nI am a reporter for The Nation magazine and other outlets. I seek a fee waiver, but if that waiver is denied I am willing to pay up to $25 for these records.\r\n\r\nI seek expedited processing for this request. The information I seek could shed light on a matter of urgent and compelling public interest -- namely, the potential involvement of federal government personnel in the alleged sex trafficking operation organized by the late Jeffrey Epstein. This information is at the center of public discourse at this moment, and the Epstein case is a matter that involves the White House, Congress and numerous judicial bodies. It is imperative that the public obtain information on this matter in a timely matter, particularly given the corrosive effects the Epstein case has had on trust in government. For the reasons above, I ask that my request be given expedited processing because there is an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged federal government activity, and I am a person primarily engaged in disseminating information. I intend to use the requested records to inform the public about actual government activity. I certify the foregoing to be true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
