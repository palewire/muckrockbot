We are reaching out to you to determine if you are still interested in these records, or, if at this time, you would consider reducing the size of your request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis. Requests are divided into two primary tracks -simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents). Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-500 pages), large (501-4,999 pages), and extra-large (5,000 and over pages) sub-tracks are based upon request size.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the large track and reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us with regards to this inquiry to let us know if you are still interested in receiving records for this request either in full (the remaining records), or reducing the request to a faster processing track.\r\nIf you reduce the size, you may request remaining, additional records by submitting a new FOIPA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<http://www.fbi.gov/foia> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DA2456.D092CD00][Logo, company name  Description automatically generated]",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.

Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,370 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u2018Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u2019 link. Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks-simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into small, medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track extra-small requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days, medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,370 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the [complex] request [large] processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is [September, 2026].  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please indicate so and a representative will be in contact.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Big Local News is a program of Stanford University\u2019s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and helps journalists collect, process and analyze public data. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking any datasets, databases, and/or spreadsheets sufficient to show the following information regarding every current or former employee of the Hawaii AG's Office, Hawaii Department of Taxation, Hawaii Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement, Hawaii Department of Transportation, and Hawaii Department of Public Safety, year-by-year, dating back however far as the electronic data exist for:\r\n\r\nFirst name\r\nMiddle name or initial\r\nLast name\r\nUnique employee identification number\r\nRace\r\nGender\r\nYear of birth\r\nEmploying agency\r\nJob title\r\nDivision assignment\r\nHire date\r\nSeparation date, if applicable\r\nReason for separation, if applicable\r\n\r\nIf your roster system contains data elements not listed above, please include them in the response, provided they are releasable under the law. On the other hand, we recognize some of the information we are asking for may not be tracked by your system. If that is the case, we are willing to accept as many of the data elements as your agency maintains. If some records are more readily available, we are happy to receive partial information as soon as possible while the remaining request is processed. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the data elements listed, we request documentation necessary to understand and interpret the data, including but not limited to record layouts, data dictionaries, code sheets, lookup tables, etc. \r\n\r\nOur preference is to receive structured data provided in a machine-readable text file, such as delimited or fixed-width formats. We can also handle a variety of other data formats including SQL databases, Excel workbooks and MS Access. If there are additional formats your agency would prefer to provide, please let us know. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking this information as a news media organization on a matter of public interest concerning the conduct of government. As such, we ask for a waiver of all fees, if allowed under state law. If fees are necessary to reimburse the agency for actual costs, we agree to pay up to $100. If costs exceed that amount, please let us know before fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease send clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time.

        "communication": "Dear Susan Dyer Reynolds,\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are following up on a records request that was sent from \u201cBelle Reve\u201d from the muckrock email address above.  The Office of the Mayor responded to this request on September 4 and September 18.  See attached file entitled \u201cRe_Sunshine Great Highway.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn our response of September 18, we provided five records responsive to the original request.  Two of those records contained redactions.  We set forth the bases of those redactions in the body of our response.  We understand that your Immediate Disclosure Request, sent Sunday and therefore deemed received today, seeks unredacted versions of those two records.\r\n\r\nThe redacted versions of those files are linked in the attached.  We cannot provide unredacted versions.  As we clearly explained in our September 18 email, \u201cthe record entitled \u201cRe_MEDIA Alert \u2026\u201d has been redacted to protect personal contact information.  See California Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 1; Cal. Gov. Code 7927.700.\u201d  As shown in that file, we redacted the personal email contact information of a member of the public to protect their privacy.  Those redactions were identified, along with the statutory citations to justify them, in the body of our September 18 email.\r\n\r\nWe also clearly explained that \u201c[t]he record entitled \u201cRE_Draft Great Highway \u2026\u201d has been redacted pursuant to the attorney/client privilege.  See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 7927.705; Cal. Evid. Code \u00a7 954; S.F. Admin. Code \u00a7 67.21(k).\u201d  All of the redactions in that file were made because all of the redacted portions are communications made for purposes of soliciting or receiving legal advice and are therefore protected from disclosure pursuant to the attorney/client privilege.  The statutory citations to justify these redactions are also clearly provided in the body of our September 18 email.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Mayor\u2019s Office satisfied our obligations under SFSO 67.27 by clearly identifying and justifying the redactions in these files with citations to specific statutory authority.  We also provided a clear reference to the justifications for the withholdings in each document, as we provided statements for each document explaining the redactions in those documents, as required by SFSO 67.26.  We also kept withholding to a minimum; only the portions of the \u201cRe_MEDIA Alert\u201d document with personal contact information and the portions of the \u201cRe_Draft Great Highway\u201d document containing attorney/client privileged communications were withheld.  See SFSO 67.26.  No additional redactions were made.\r\n\r\nThus, we have provided you with responsive records and properly justified the redactions in those records.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have located additional records responsive to your request.  See them attached here.  Note that the record entitled \u201c00. Notes -  Great Highway Parade 6.29.24_Redacted\u201d contains redactions of certain phone numbers which have been withheld to protect personal privacy and because they constitute official information subject to the official information privilege.  See California Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 1; Cal. Gov. Code 7927.700; Cal. Evid. Code 1040.\r\n\r\nWe have not withheld any records in their entirety in response to your request.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nHank Heckel\r\nLegal Compliance Officer\r\nOffice of the Mayor\r\nCity and County of San Francisco",

However, such requests are reserved for requests that are \u201csimple, routine and readily answerable.\u201d See San Francisco Administrative Code Section 67.25(a).  Your request seeks communications between anyone in the Mayor\u2019s Office and five different individuals with no subject matter limitation over an unlimited period of time.  Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for an immediate disclosure request and is being processed as a regular request.\r\n\r\nWe have invoked a 14 day extension from the original due date due to the need to consult with another City department.  See Cal. Gov. Code 7922.535(a) and S.F. Admin. Code \u00a7 67.25(b).

We received DOI-OS-002552 on 9/14; DOI-OS-2020-005832 on 9/22; DOI-OS-2020-005857 and DOI-OS-2020-005859, on 9/23.\r\n\r\nOur regulations require that your FOIA requests contain sufficient information for us to determine your proper fee category.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.38(a).  Your requests do not fulfill this requirement because \u200bthey do not indicate whether you are commercial, educational/non-commercial scientific, media or other type of requester \u200bas your interest in requested information will affect if any fees will be assessed.  We therefore are unable to process your four requests at this time.  If you wish to pursue your requests, please provide us with more information that will further explain your fee category.\r\n\r\n\u200bOnce the fee category is resolved, additional information\u200b is needed on  \u200bthe following requests:\r\nFor DOI-OS-2020-002552, \u200bthe scope is unclear and additional information is needed. FOIA requires that requests describe the records sought with sufficient detail to allow an agency employee familiar with the subject area of the request to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort.  Your request does not adequately describe the records sought.  Please provide more information, such who/which office you would like searched, where you would like us to search, etc.\r\n\r\nFor DOI-OS-2020-005832, there \u200bis no attachment, we are \u200bunable to identify the subject of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may contact our office by email at osfoia@ios.doi.gov,<mailto:osfoia@ios.doi.gov,> through FOIA Online, by phone at (202) 513-0765, by fax at (202) 219-2374, or by mail at U.S. Department of the Interior, 1849 C St, N.W., MS-7328 MIB, Washington, D.C. 20240.

Written requests for records to state and local agencies in Pennsylvania are generally governed by the Commonwealth\u2019s Right-to-Know Law (RTKL), 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101-67.3104. In accordance with the RTKL, the City has promulgated an Open Records Policy, which requires the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form be used for the submission of written requests pursuant to the RTKL.

You do not have to resubmit your request for the City to respond unless you are specifically informed otherwise. The City reserves the right to require a formal RTK Request be submitted pursuant to the RTKL before releasing records. The City is continuing to process the request you have submitted as an informal request outside the RTKL and will be in touch with you further to respond to your request.  However, if you would like to file a RTK Request, please submit your request on or with the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form and email your request to righttoknowlaw@phila.gov \u2013 please do not reply to this email. Please include this notice with your RTK Request.

In accordance with RTKL, the City has promulgated an Open Records Policy, which requires use of the standard statewide Right to Know Form for the submission of written requests pursuant to RTKL (\u201cRTK Requests\u201d). See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.504(a); Dekok v. Lancaster County, AP 2010-1197, 2011 PA O.O.R.D. LEXIS 25 at *5 and n.1 (Pa. O.O.R.

Gaming Control Bd. v. Office of Open Records, 48 A.3d 503 (Pa. Commw. 2012).

His death is widely-known and widely reported; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act. For example, you may find his New York Times obituary at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/business/media/denny-walsh-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a media requester. I am an associate editor at Reason Magazine who has written numerous articles on topics of public interest for the Daily Beast, the Asia Times, Responsible Statecraft, the National Interest, America Magazine and the Armenian Weekly, and I am requesting these documents in an editorial capacity. Please contact me if you have any questions about my media status.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If your FOIPA Number is [1195846-1] please enter [1195846-001] into the system.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Dr. Starsky was a professor of philosophy at Arizona State University (ASU) from 1964 until 1970, when he was fired by ASU for participating in a civil rights protest. Concurrent to this, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was surveilling Dr. Starsky as part of COINTELPRO. Dr. Starsky successfully petitioned the FBI to release documents related this surveillance campaign as part of a Freedom of Information Act request in 1974. I am requesting all documents previously released to Dr. Starsky at that time and any subsequent records, documents, or communications the FBI may have produced concerning Dr. Starsky. There is no expectation of a violation of Dr. Starsky's privacy as he previously made these documents public; additionally, Dr. Starsky passed away on January 20, 1989. A  copy of his obituary from the January 22, 1989 edition of The Arizona Republic is attached.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media, and I am asking you waive any fees associated with this request.

If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

I was wondering if I could get a copy of the documents you reference in your response, as per my original request. For example, it would be great to get copies of the challenges made by Michele Haroon, Mark Vaeth, and the Election Integrity Force, specifically any emails they sent and attached documents or spreadsheets detailing their challenge. Documents detailing your office's response to their challenge -- for example email correspondence or any notices sent to those challenged -- would also be helpful. \r\n\r\nI left a voicemail earlier and feel free to call me directly to chat more about the request: 914-817-4482.\r\n\r\nThank you so much!\r\nEva",

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically.
