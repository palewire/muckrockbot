        "communication": "Subject: ALPR Audit Reports Review by Chief of Police Schenita Stewart\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request records related to the Evanston Police Department\u2019s (EPD) use of Flock Safety automated license plate reader (ALPR) technology. This request is based on a recent communication from Schenita Stewart, Chief of Police regarding state surveillance and Evanston\u2019s Welcoming City Ordinance:\r\n\r\n\u201cTo ensure compliance with the Welcoming City Ordinance and protect community trust, I have assigned a dedicated supervisor to oversee all aspects of ALPR usage within EPD. Furthermore, we conduct regular organizational and network audits, which I personally review. EPD also operates under a clear and established policy governing ALPR use, reinforcing both accountability and transparency.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to the City of Evanston's website page on the \"Welcoming City Ordinance\" (Ordinance 17-O-25):\r\n\r\n\"Key updates to the Ordinance include:\r\n\r\nData Protection: Prohibiting the sharing of city databases or information with federal immigration agencies, or with third parties unless they certify against its use for civil immigration enforcement.\r\n\r\nExpanded Safeguards: Clarifying that City officials will not participate in civil immigration enforcement by any agency or personnel, including private contractors. The City will continue to comply with a valid criminal warrant.\r\n\r\nClosing Loopholes: Strengthening policies to eliminate exceptions that previously allowed limited City involvement in immigration enforcement under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nSupport for Immigrants: Codifying practices that assist crime victims in obtaining specific visas and providing immigration resource information through public services like 311.\r\n\r\nSafe Public Buildings: The City is now tasked with developing policies for its public facilities that prioritize limiting immigration enforcement operations on their premises to the fullest extent allowed by law.\"\r\n\r\nIn light of this statement made by Schenita Stewart, Chief of Police, along with the updates to Evanston's Welcoming City Ordinance, and in accordance with Illinois law (625 ILCS 5/2-130), which prohibits sharing automated license plate reader ALPR data with out-of-state agencies for purposes such as interfering with reproductive health access or enforcing immigration laws, I request full transparency for the following:\r\n\r\n1) Any records showing review or oversight of Flock Safety automated license plate reader ALPR Organization or Network audit reports by the Chief of Police Schenita Stewart from January 1, 2024, to the present - including emails, memos, meeting notes, audit summaries, annotations, or briefings demonstrating the Stewart\u2019s direct involvement in reviewing audit data.\r\n\r\n2) Any communications between the Chief of Police Schenita Stewart and Evanston Police Department supervisors or Flock Safety automated license plate reader ALPR administrators regarding network audit findings that raised questions or concerns, including but not limited to:\r\n    a) Access by out-of-state agencies (e.g., AL, FL, IN, KY, MO, NC, TX, etc) \r\n    b) Federal agency involvement (e.g., DHS, HSI, ICE, CBP, etc)\r\n    c) References to abortion or reproductive health care (e.g., abortion, women, woman, pregnant, pp, planned parenthood, etc)\r\n    d) References to immigration enforcement (e.g., immigration, border patrol, 287g, etc)\r\n    e) Search reasons lacking case numbers or specific descriptions (e.g., inv, p, m, zz, training, test, ab501, invest, narcotics, drugs, 123abv, etc)\r\n\r\n3) Any internal protocols or policies that describe the role of the Evanston Police Department\u2019s chief or supervisors in reviewing Flock Safety automated license plate reader ALPR audits and identifying potentially inappropriate use, particularly regarding compliance with Illinois statutes and Evanston\u2019s Welcoming City Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nNiles Coalition",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Abe,\r\n\r\nIn regards to your FOIA request regarding the task force queries:\r\n\r\n1) Police reports, investigative files, and case notes for the cases involving these queries.\r\nThe Palos Heights Police Department does not have any records or files in relation to the case involving the Flock inquiries mentioned.\r\n\r\n2) Any policies, procedures, SOPs, or internal memos from Palos Heights PD regarding working on immigration cases and cooperation with ICE.\r\nThe Palos Heights Police Department does not work on immigration cases and we do not contact ICE, or anyone else, when a subject is found to have an immigration detainer.  Attached are emails forwarded to officers, containing guidance to not honor detainers if received and the Immigration Law Guidance to Law Enforcement sent out by the Illinois Attorney General.  None of our officers are cross-designated with any immigration authority.\r\n\r\n3) If the query was run as part of a taskforce assignment, please provide any post orders or other designations (letter of assignment, email stating they are assigned to that taskforce, etc.) that indicate the individual was assigned to the taskforce at that time.\r\nOur investigation into this matter has revealed that while these inquiries appear to have been run as part of a taskforce assignment, no member of the Palos Heights Police Department \"ran\" those queries.  They were, apparently, run by another, non-Palos Heights, task force member who used a  Palos Height's member's sign in and password information without his knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.\nThank you,\r\nMorgan Pukula\r\nPalos Heights Police Department\r\n7607 W College Drive\r\nPalos Heights, IL 60463\r\nt: 708-448-5060\r\nf: 708-361-9371",

        "communication": "Dear Nina Wang:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA), Office of Information Affairs, FOIA Division (OIA-FOIA). Your request was received by this office on July 7, 2025.\r\n\r\nThe OIA-FOIA is under the purview of the General Counsel (GC) and serves as the focal point for USDA's FOIA program. It provides coordination and ensures agency-wide compliance with the FOIA.  Additionally, the OIA-FOIA processes requests and appeals on behalf of the Office of the Secretary (OSEC); the Under Secretaries; USDA's staff offices; and the Research, Education and Economics and Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs mission areas.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires USDA to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the Federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous records that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches with components and possible consultations with components that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, USDA will invoke a 10 business day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Pursuant to USDA FOIA Regulations, Title 7 CFR \u00a71.6(a), the USDA processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow USDA to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you have been categorized as a \"news media\" requester,\r\npursuant to 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1 Section 2(b)(4)(i). For your review and information, a copy of the USDA FOIA Fee Schedule is attached. In accordance with 7 CFR Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 1, Section 3(b), your fees shall be waived where the amount of the fee is $25.00 or less.\r\n\r\nYou have requested a fee waiver.  Your fee waiver request is under consideration.\r\n\r\nA search will be conducted for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA analyst will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned FOIA Case No. 2025-OSEC-08250-F. Please refer to this case number in any future correspondence. If you have any questions regarding the processing of this request, please contact Susan Ruppel at 202-690-5220 or electronically at susan.ruppel@usda.gov<mailto:susan.ruppel@usda.gov> or USDAFOIA@usda.gov<mailto:USDAFOIA@usda.gov>.\r\n\r\nFor additional information regarding USDA FOIA regulations and process, please refer to the information available on-line at Freedom of Information Act Division | USDA.<https://www.usda.gov/ogc/office-information-affairs/foia-division>\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOffice of Information Affairs\r\nFreedom of Information Act Division\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan Ruppel, Esq.\r\nFOIA Analyst\r\nOffice of Information Affairs (OIA)\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DBEF4C.09875A60]\r\nOffice of the General Counsel (OGC)\r\n1400 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC, 20250\r\nP:  202-690-5220\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information generated by the USDA solely for the intended recipients.

The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Portions of the information you seek are exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, section 7.5(r) exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at its direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored. 105 ILCS 10/2(d): Release of a minor\u2019s record may only be authorized by the parent or guardian in accordance with the Illinois Student Records Act (105 ILCS 10/1 et seq.). Additionally, guidance provided by 5 ILCS 7(1)(d)(iv) exempts information that would \u201cunavoidably disclose the identity of a confidential source, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, or persons who file complaints with or provide information to administrative, investigative, law enforcement, or penal agencies; except that the identities of witnesses to traffic crashes, traffic crash reports, and rescue reports shall be provided by agencies of local government, except when disclosure would interfere with an active criminal investigation conducted by the agency that is the recipient of the request. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.

We understand that you are requesting the following public  information:\u00a0\r\n\"I would like a spreadsheet containing all the academic dishonesty reports from the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester to the end of the Spring 2025 Semester, organized by university college.\"\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn complying with this request, please see the attached document when reviewing this information please consider the custodian's commetns which are provided below.\r\n______________________________________________________\r\n\"It is important to note that these are reports and do not reflect outcomes. So Arts and Humanities had 38 reports of dishonesty but that does not mean that 38 individuals were found responsible of dishonesty. I am merrily giving you the number of reports that were submitted.\r\nImportant to note that Natural and Social Sciences is the largest college, followed by Arts and Humanities, then School of Business and then School of Education (largest meaning overall enrollment of students). \r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information. Academic dishonesty/Misconduct covers a variety of charges (plagiarism, cheating, etc.) based on the request I am just giving anything that falls under the umbrella of academic dishonesty (which is all academic misconduct).\r\n\r\nI have divided the colleges by Current system effective July 1, 2025. The Unknown are cases where allegations of academic misconduct were made but no information about who did it was included in the report. An example is someone in my class was cheating but I don't know who they are the and the report writer didn't include class information. \"\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n I apologize for the delay as I was out sick last week. We try not to charge for quick report information.\u00a0SOU\u00a0now considers this request\u00a0fulfilled, please let me know if you have any questions\u00a0or concerns.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHave a beautiful day!",

The data your received did not have the redactions applied. We are providing a REVISED (redacted) installment 5 and installment 6. \r\nPlease delete/replace your installment 5 with the REVISED Installment 5 data and installment 6 with the REVISED Installment 6 data. The revised data (installment 5 and installment 6 along), and installment 7 have been uploaded to your request center.

These records include, but are not limited to, NRIs. \r\n\r\nBecause these data will reveal the degree to which USCIS and DHS are affording protection for migrants and refugees consistently with U.S. and international law, because the consequences of failing to do so involve documented risks of kidnapping, extortion, rape, and murder, and because the re-initiation of MPP has been the subject of widespread and extraordinary media interest, I respectfully request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5.(e). \r\n\r\nI make this request on behalf the #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative of Al Otro Lado.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Jaspar Singh, who died in ICE Custody April 15, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrSinghJaspar.pdf\r\n\r\nI make this request as a member of the media, and therefore seek a fee waiver. Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3. The current administration's expansion of federal immigration detention is the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Jaspar Singh, who died in ICE Custody April 15, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrSinghJaspar.pdf. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \r\n\r\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \r\n\r\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \r\n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \r\n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \r\n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \r\n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \r\n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \r\n\r\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25068. Please use this number in future correspondence. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA Office \r\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nFreedom of Information Act Office \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

        "communication": "5/19/2025 \n\nAndrew Free \nMuck Rock News, DEPT MR182995 \n263 Huntington Ave \nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \n\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2025-ICFO-25068 \n\nDear Requester: \n\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 3/13/2025.  You have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Jaspar Singh, who died in ICE Custody April 15, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrSinghJaspar.pdf. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nA search of the ICE Offices of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) for records responsive to your request produced 8 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 8 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.

        "communication": "5/19/2025 \n\nAndrew Free \nMuck Rock News, DEPT MR182995 \n263 Huntington Ave \nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \n\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2025-ICFO-25068 \n\nDear Requester: \n\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 3/13/2025.  You have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Jaspar Singh, who died in ICE Custody April 15, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrSinghJaspar.pdf. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nA search of the ICE Offices of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) for records responsive to your request produced 8 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 8 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nSincerely, \n\nMegan Davis \nDeputy FOIA Officer, Operations \n\nEnclosure(s):\t8 Pages\n",

Please include the following documents: \r\n\r\n1) NDAs, MSAs, Statement of Work (SOWs), Invoices to-date (January 1, 2025 to the date of fulfilment), and other contracting documents between your agency and Trapwire Inc or parent company ABRAXAS APPLICATIONS, INC.\u201d \r\n\r\nIn response to your request, the following document is hereby being provided in its entirety: \r\n\r\n(1)\tContract: N0018924P0143 (28 pages) \r\n\r\nThe foregoing document is provided with redactions pursuant to the following: \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 4 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(4)), exempting disclosure of confidential business/source selection information. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(6)), exempting disclosure of names and other personally identifiable information pertaining to third parties in order to protect personal privacy. \r\n\r\n1.\tI have concluded that releasing third-party privacy information of the type contained in the enclosed documents would clearly be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and could lead to harassment and embarrassment for the person(s) involved. \r\n\r\n2.\tI have determined that releasing commercial and financial information of the type contained in the enclosed documents would have a detrimental effect on future government acquisition efforts by discouraging submitters of such information from voluntarily furnishing useful commercial or financial information to the government and correspondingly impact the assurance the government gets that the information will be reliable. \r\n\r\nI was advised that there are no NDA\u2019s, MSA\u2019s or invoices associated with this contract. \r\n\r\nYour document has been uploaded to Secure Release for you to view and download. If you have not done so already, please navigate to https://www.securerelease.us/ and create your account so that you can access the system. All future requests should be made through this system, and all documents will be released through this system. \r\n\r\nThe fee associated with processing this request has been waived. If you have any questions, please contact me via e-mail at michael.j.maurice.civ@us.navy.mil. \r\n\r\nYou have the right to an appeal. It must be received (i.e., post-marked if by mail, sent if by email, submitted if through the Internet) within 90 calendar days from the date of this letter. Please provide the appellate authority (see below) the following in an envelope marked \u201cFOIA appeal\u201d: \r\n\u2022\ta letter requesting an appeal that explains what you are appealing with any supporting arguments or reasons you think may be worthy of consideration. \r\n\u2022\ta copy of your initial request. \r\n\u2022\ta copy of the letter of denial. \r\n\r\nAlso, please provide just a copy of your appeal letter: \r\n\r\nATTN: FOIA Officer \r\nNaval Supply Systems Command (SUP03) \r\n5450 Carlisle Pike, BLDG 309-303-15 \r\nMechanicsburg, PA 17055-0791 \r\n\r\nIf by email to michael.j.maurice.civ@.us.navy.mil. \r\n\r\nThe two main ways to file an appeal are by mail or through the Internet. \r\n\r\n1.

Alternatively, it may be sent to the Department of the Navy General Counsel if appropriate (the Office of the General Counsel generally handles issues outside of those of the uniformed service). That address is as follows: \r\n\r\nDepartment of the Navy, \r\nOffice of the General Counsel, 1000 Navy Pentagon, Room 5A532 Washington, DC 20350-1000] \r\n\r\n2. Through the Internet.

By email. The Judge Advocate General (Code 14) may be reached at Navy-OJAG-C14-FOIA-PA-ADMINAPPEALS@us.navy.mil. \r\n\r\nTo appeal a request that was not submitted through the SecureRelease portal, create a SecureRelease portal account, then use the Create Request button on the SecureRelease portal homepage to create a FOIA request.

An accounting of all calls for service (sometimes referred to as \"dispatch logs\") between the dates of 1/1/20 and 1/31/25. Please provide these in the format in which they are stored in your system, which may be a database, spreadsheet, CSV file, or similar. The format may also be the same as Allegheny County\u2019s 911 dispatches for EMS and Fire, which are published to WPRDC: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-911-dispatches-ems-and-fire\r\nThe database may include, but not be limited to, properties relating to: call date and time; origin of the call (police-initiated, 911 call, 311 call, etc.); who was dispatched; call disposition; call resolution time.\r\n2. A data dictionary describing the properties present in the table, and how they relate to other records such as published incidents or arrests.\r\n3. Any additional training materials or documentation for how this data is created, or how it should be used internally.\r\n\r\nIf any part of the request cannot be met, please proceed with the remaining parts.\r\n\r\nIf any part of the request is denied, please cite the law under which the denial is allowed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJosh Chamberlain",

I have a couple followup questions which may save the trouble of an additional request:\r\n\r\nThe drive consists of 5 PDFs over 120MB and 75,000 pages each. This is not a usable database format, and would require significant effort to parse and use\u2014as not to mention the reality of error in conversion. I had originally requested that the records be shared in the same format in which you have them stored, i.e. a database.  Would your office be able to export this data into a more usable format? CSV, JSON, Excel, SQLite? \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it's not possible to determine whether each call was a police, fire, or EMS response. The data dictionary from WPRDC for the Fire/EMS dispatch is similar, but not applicable. Is there an explanation of the \"call type\" property which may shed some light, or a property which documents who was dispatched?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJosh",
