Please avoid providing data in PDF or paper printouts.\r\n\r\nThis request is made to support academic research conducted in the public interest and is not for commercial purposes. The data will contribute to a research project assessing the effect of music concerts on crime, aiming to enhance public understanding of how large events influence community safety.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKristina Block",

A reminder that nothing in California Penal Code 832.7 mentions photographs in personnel records are kept confidential. Not only that, but videos and pictures of officers are regularly shared on social media. \r\nhttps://www.courthousenews.com/judge-tosses-las-second-lawsuit-against-journalist-over-police-headshots/ \r\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-13/city-of-la-officers-city \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

These and other records thus made available will, we hope and expect, be referenced in research papers and other writings, and the mere availability of them makes the public aware of an entire field of government operations (namely, collaboration with Hollywood) of which the public is largely not aware. This increased awareness, in turn, has the potential to transform the way the public sees films. Furthermore, I am the editor-in-chief of a research magazine published by said foundation  called \"Cultural Engineering Studies,\" to which I also contribute articles (including a recent article on NASA's relationship to Hollywood). The magazine explores, among other topics, Hollywood's relationship to the federal government, and such documents indeed are cited in the magazine.\r\n\r\nI therefore repeat my request for a waiver of fees, having rebutted the finding that this work does not contribute in any significant way to the public's understanding of government. \r\n\r\nIn the event that this waiver request is not accepted, I still wish you to process the FOIA request, under the stipulations stated in the original request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

Doing so would remove approximately 1685 pages. There are approximately 18,649 potentially responsive pages, so removing the court documents alone wouldn't be enough to move the request from the extra-large track (> 8,000 pages). We would be happy to make this reduction for you, but would ask that you consider making a further reduction to move the request into one of the faster tracks. Would you possibly be willing to reduce the request to up to 950 pages to move the request into the medium track? You are always welcome to request additional material once a release has been made. We could take the first 950 pages, the last 950, or split between the beginning and end of the file if you would like.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to move forward.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFBI FOIA Negotiation Team\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nfbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n540-868-1695",

In order for IU to begin processing your request, you will need to provide further information regarding the record(s) you are requesting. APRA requires that a request for inspection and/or copying must identify with reasonable particularity the record(s) being requested. I.C. 5-14-3-3(a)(1). The Indiana Court of Appeals has held that \"[w]hether a request identifies with reasonable particularity the record being requested turns, in part, on whether the person making the request provides the agency with information that enables the agency to search for, locate and retrieve records.\" Jent v. Fort Wayne Police Dep't, 973 N.E.2d 30, 34 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012).\r\n\r\nAs currently written, your below request does not identify reasonably particular parameters that enable the University to \"search for, locate and retrieve records.\" While the term \"reasonable particularity\" is not defined within APRA, I encourage you to read the many opinions of the Indiana Public Access Counselor, along with Anderson v. Huntington Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs, 983 N.E.2d 613 (Ind. Ct. App. 2013).\r\n\r\nPer this authority, please further specify the type(s) of record(s) that you are seeking in response to your request below.

Specifically:\r\n\r\nThese reports are completed by the athletic department for the National Collegiate Athletic Association for the fiscal years listed above. This report is a multi-page document that had to be submitted to the NCAA in January. It contains 40+ revenue and expense categories, followed by specific breakdowns of each of those categories, by sport and gender. I am requesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther Reporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that appears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different than the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for Title IX compliance.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) on which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Stacey Brook.",

Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c).\u00a0 [As your request seeks documents that will require a thorough and wide-ranging search, CBP will invoke a 10-day extension for your request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). If you would like to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office.\u00a0 We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.] OR [As your request seeks a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records, CBP will invoke a 10-day extension for your request pursuant to \u00a06 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). \u00a0If you would like to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office.\u00a0 We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.] OR [As the subject matter of your request is of substantial interest to two or more components of CBP or of substantial interest to another agency, we will need to consult with those entities before we issue a final response.\u00a0 Due to these unusual circumstances, CBP will invoke a 10-day extension for your request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). If you would like to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office.\u00a0 We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.] \r\nCBP\u2019s FOIA Division is working hard to reduce the amount of time necessary to respond to FOIA requests.\u00a0 We truly appreciate your continued patience. \r\nFor additional information please consult CBP FOIA website please click on FOIA Act Resources or visit (http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia) http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia.

The period of said report shall be from October 1st, 2020 to August 24th, 2021. \n\nPlease include in the said report: \n- Expected Departures \n- Out-of country Overstays \n- Suspected In-Country Overstays \n- Include age groups and gender \n\nRecords are attached to this email. \n\nCBP is granting your request under the FOIA, Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.

See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nYou may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-2021-098543 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

        "communication": "Good Afternoon Mr. Scott,\r\n\r\nAs you know, our office is the City Attorney for the City of Irvine and Irvine Police Department (collectively, the \u201cCity\u201d).  Please allow this correspondence to serve as the City\u2019s follow-up correspondence to your public records act (\u201cPRA\u201d) request below.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the City has reviewed your PRA request and has determined it seeks an excessively large volume of potentially responsive documents spanning a 10-year period, which at this time, would pose a significant undue burden on limited staff time and resources.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to streamline the documents you seek, the City is requesting further clarification pertaining to the categories of records requested below:\r\n\r\n- Any accounting records or statistics on seized real estate, vehicles, firearms, funds in bank accounts, and seizures made by the department, as well as seizures made by federal authorities where the department receives a share under the MOUs the department has in place with numerous agencies describing how assets are to be divided. Please clarify whether you seek information on all seized items, or whether this is specifically requesting information on seizures relating to asset forfeiture.  As phrased, the request is ambiguous and overbroad.  The City requests that you further clarify and/or narrow the scope of this request.\r\n\r\n- Sales of non-monetary assets, receipts of sale for vehicles, or the destruction of other non-monetary assets. Please clarify whether this category is specific to asset forfeitures.  As phrased, it is ambiguous and overbroad.  The City requests that you further clarify and/or narrow the scope of this request.\r\n\r\n-Please also include any information relating to contested seizures. This request does not include court documents for individual forfeiture cases.  This request as phrased\u2014\u201cany information\u201d\u2014is incredibly overbroad.  Please identify which types of documents and/or specific categories of records you seek.  The City requests that you further clarify and/or narrow the scope of this request.\r\n\r\nFinally, as your request spans a 10-year period, please understand the City will need additional time to locate potentially responsive records to this request.  If you could further narrow the time-period requested, it would expedite the processing of these documents for disclosure.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.  We look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nKelsey\r\n\r\nKelsey Quist<http://www.rutan.com/Kelsey-Quist>\r\n18575 Jamboree Road, 9th Floor | Irvine, CA 92612\r\nO. (714) 641-5100 | D.

The City requests that you further clarify and/or narrow the scope of this request.\r\n\r\nAny ledgers, databases, invoices, receipts, and documentation tracking the acquisition, sales, destruction, or donations of seized real estate, vehicles, firearms, or funds in bank accounts should be included. Information related to the date, quantity, cost, invoices, item description, what was bought, what was sold, and what was donated should also be included. \r\n\r\n-Please also include any information relating to contested seizures. This request does not include court documents for individual forfeiture cases. This request as phrased\u2014\u201cany information\u201d\u2014is incredibly overbroad.

I request a search of all locations where such documents might be located, including but not limited to the entertainment liaison offices and communications HQ or similar offices.\r\n\r\nAttached is a document, released to me by the FBI in response to a previous FOIA request, confirming that the FBI supported the production of \"Rising Hate: Antisemitism in America.\"\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

These medical records are crucial to the adoption of these K9s)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request encompasses, but is not limited to, all records of complaints received, inspection reports, investigative files, and any other documents generated or compiled by the Bureau in connection with said investigations. Specifically, the request seeks records covering the period from JANUARY 1, 2023, to the PRESENT DATE.\r\n\r\nA waiver of all applicable fees associated with this request is respectfully requested. The disclosure of these records is crucial to myself, as I am the current adopter of a Contract Working Dog (CWD) that Anne Gibbs had her in possession for a period of time. I state 'Her Possession' because to refer to it as 'Care' would do a disservice to CWD Cezar. He was one of the 28 K9s that were seized from her property, and rescued from PSPCA, where he remained until I adopted him. In addition, this case is  demonstrably in the public interest, as it pertains to potential animal cruelty within an animal rescue organization. The release of this information would significantly contribute to public understanding of the oversight and operations of such organizations, thereby promoting animal welfare and fostering accountability within the community. This request is not predicated upon a commercial interest, but rather seeks to ensure the welfare of animals and promote transparency in the handling of animal cruelty complaints.\r\n\r\nExpedited processing of this request is respectfully requested due to the potential ongoing nature of the alleged animal welfare concerns and the necessity for prompt action. Animal cruelty investigations are inherently time-sensitive, and delays in access to pertinent information may adversely affect ongoing investigations and the safety and well-being of the animals involved. There are several posts on Anne Gibbs public social media page, which I believe, are possible indicators of continued neglect.\r\n\r\nI currently serve as a K9 Handler in the Private Sector, along with a branch of the Department of Defense. I am a Nationally Certified K9 Handler, with extreme knowledge and certification of these working K9s.  I am also still serving as a member of the United States Army, as a Military Police Officer. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or on USB/CD-ROM. I can provide the CD-ROM/USB if requested. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nVery Respectfully,\r\n\r\nJulia Valenti\r\nCPT, MP\r\nCommanding\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I also request data on license-exempt providers, if available. Specifically, I request the following information as it is available:\r\n1) Provider name or ID\r\n2) Street number\r\n3) Street name\r\n4) City\r\n5) Zip code\r\n6) Licensed capacity for each year (by child age group if available)\r\n7) Enrollment for each year (by child age group if available)\r\n8) Provider type (e.g., center-based provider, home-based provider, Head Start, school-based pre-K, etc.) for each year\r\n9) First license issue (open) date\r\n10) Most recent license issue date\r\n11) Most recent license expiration date or close date\r\n12) Ages served for each year\r\n13) Hours of operation for each year\r\n14) QRIS rating for each year (please explain who is required to participate and whether there are financial supports based on rating)\r\n15) Accepts Child Care and Development Fund subsidies for each year\r\n16) Accepts other types of subsidies for each year (please list types)\r\n17) Prices for each year (by child age group if available)\r\n18) Violation records\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. Sincerely, Gabrielle Pepin Upload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Foregon-department-of-early-learning-and-care-35979%252Fchild-care-provider-data-182223%252F%253Femail%253DKris.REMMY%252540delc.oregon.gov&url_auth_token=AAG3JGu6ZMgu682BXFnl5LQKSvc%3A1tnrjJ%3AwXqf2ORiKbaGpNjOX3xY8XNxkULKYCZZZEAtk3cMUnc\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is to confirm that DELC is the custodian of the requested records. Before we can proceed, we need some additional clarification.\r\n\r\nThere are no responsive records to the following data points, as requested:\r\n\r\n  *   DELC does not collect, monitor, or track any data on license exempt providers, unless they are a recorded program.\r\n  *   DELC does not monitor or track enrollment.\r\n  *   DELC does monitor some provider types (center-based or home-based), but we do not monitor or track other specific program/service types.\r\n  *   DELC monitors a provider\u2019s acceptance of subsidies only if they are a current participant, so there is no historical data available.\r\n  *   DELC does not monitor or track previous QRIS ratings, only the current QRIS rating of an active/most recent awarding.\r\n  *   DELC does not monitor the price of services offered.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we are currently unable to determine if there is historical data for the following:\r\n\r\n  *   Hours of operation.\r\n  *   Ages served.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Oregon Revised Statues ORS 192.365, your request does not show by clear and convincing evidence that the public interest requires disclosure of the requested information for RF and CF facilities in this particular instance. Therefore, we are only able to share the following information:\r\n\r\n     *   Active RF and CF facilities: Facility name and facility city/state/zip.\r\n     *   Active CC facilities: Facility name, full facility address (street and number, city/state/zip).\r\n\r\nThe request for violation records spanning \u201cas far back as the data systems allow\u201d is denied. The request is too broad, and the information is available on our Child Safety Portal, as found here: Find Child Care Oregon - Find Child Care Oregon<https://findchildcareoregon.org/>\r\n\r\nOregon Revised Statues Referenced:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   ORS 192.365: Child care facility operator and exempt family child care provider information (residential address and telephone numbers, personal email addresses, personal cell phone numbers, Social Security numbers, employer-issued identification card numbers, and emergency contact information)\r\n\r\nIf you would like to proceed with a quote for the portions of your request that are available, please let me know by responding to this email.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n[A picture containing graphics, cartoon  Description automatically generated]\r\nMadison Buck (She/Her)\u200b\r\nDepartment of Early Learning and Care\u200b\r\nPublic Records and Communication Specialist\r\nDELC.PRRequest@DELC.oregon.gov<mailto:DELC.PRRequest@DELC.oregon.gov>\r\nWebsite: Oregon.gov/DELC<https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/4T6sCW6qNgs52KYX8Ix6GqA?domain=oregon.gov>\u200b\r\nConnect with DELC: Facebook<https://www.facebook.com/OREarlyLearning/> | Instagram<https://www.instagram.com/OREarlyLearning/> | YouTube<https://www.youtube.com/@OREarlyLearning> | LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/company/OREarlyLearning/>\r\n\r\nThe Oregon Department of Early Learning and Care (DELC) fosters coordinated, culturally appropriate, and family-centered services that recognize and respect the strengths of children, families and early learning and care professionals.

If you would like to adjust your request to encompass a smaller time period of data, that would adjust the quote as seen below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with ORS 192.324(4)(a), the public body may establish fees reasonably calculated to reimburse the public body for the public body\u2019s actual cost of making public records available, including costs for summarizing, compiling or tailoring the public records, either in organization or media, to meet the request.\r\n\r\nThe estimate to produce the requested records is as follows (subject to change):\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nHours\r\nHourly Rate\r\nSubtotal\r\nPull and organize records\r\n1.0\r\n\r\n\r\nReview and redaction for exempt material\r\n1.0\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal Estimated clerical time\r\n2.0 hours, with the first 30 minutes waived\r\n1.5\r\n$37.50\r\n$37.50\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal Cost\r\n$37.50\r\n\r\nDELC requires 50% of the total cost to begin work on this request, which would be $18.75.\r\n\r\nWe will update this estimate with the actual time it takes to process this request, and the remainder of the cost will be due prior to delivery.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the actual cost exceeds this estimate, we will contact you for approval to proceed with additional work.
