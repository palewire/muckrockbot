L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(a,:\r\n\r\nI am formally requesting records from the MA Dept of Public Utilities and Office of the Attorney General, and between the two agencies:\r\n\r\n - for any documentation of expert and/or public comment regarding health and safety concerns pertaining to 'smart meters' or \"advanced metering functionality,\" or \"AMI\" dating from January 2014 to present, including but not limited to any consultant fees paid directly or indirectly to Gradient and/or Peter Valberg; \r\n\r\n- and for information regarding the resolution of fraud complaints and cost overruns for the Worcester National Grid smart meter pilot program\r\n\r\nPlease note it is my understanding that rulings have stated that text messages count as public records as do emails sent on personal email accounts to conduct work-related business.\r\n\r\nBy way of background, in August of 2013, as reported by Go Local Worcester, \"In a stinging letter to the state Department of Public Utilities Commission, ( ), a lawyer from Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley\u2019s office pointed to large-scale tests in Illinois and elsewhere in which the meters failed to justify their costs. \u201cDespite these clear trends, [National Grid] proposes to launch a massive pilot at great ratepayer expense to test already tested hypotheses,\u201d Coakley\u2019s office wrote. The industry-friendly DPU last year brushed aside such concerns, and, in a 103-page order, approved Worcester's program. Jillian Fennimore, spokeswoman for Coakley\u2019s office, says, \u201cWe are currently monitoring the smart grid pilot program\u201d and will review the results of the final report that results. DPU referred questions about the Worcester program to National Grid.\" - http://www.golocalworcester.com/news/worcester-is-front-line-in-war-over-utilities-smart-meters/\r\n\r\nORDER 12-76 and Feb 2014 Panel Hearings:\r\n\r\nIn late February of 2014, the MA DPU held panel hearings regarding comments received in response to \"D.P.U. 12-76-A December 23, 2013, Investigation by the Department of Public Utilities on its own Motion into Modernization of the Electric Grid,\" issued by Chair Berwick. https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/9254075\r\n\r\nPeter Valberg of Gradient testified in person before the DPU for the panel hearings in Feb. 0f 2014, but no written testimony by Valberg was posted publicly.\r\n\r\nThe DPU received commentary and complaints from both health experts and from the public that the agency was relying on testimony, public relations, and marketing claims from a compromised, pro-industry, mercenary product defense expert, Peter Valberg of Gradient, who also works for the tobacco industry.\r\n\r\nORDER 12-76-B: June 2014\r\n\r\nFollowing the February hearings, on June 12 of 2014, the DPU issued order 12-76-B, https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/9241637 in which it discounted health concerns, referencing \"Gradient,\" and \"another commenter\" but not identifying Peter Valberg as the source.\r\n\r\nThe public record demonstrates that instead of consulting independent experts with health expertise and liability, the DPU promoted the opinion of Peter Valberg of Gradient Corporation, who did not file any written testimony. \r\nTherefore, the source of some claims included in MA 12-762-B discounting smart meter health and safety issues is unclear.\r\n\r\nThe MA DPU smart meter order 12-76-B made the unprecedented claim that exposure guidelines are adequate to protect against both thermal and non-thermal impacts of radio frequency exposure. The circumstances surrounding how that gross misrepresentation was incorporated in the MA DPU order, which then could be referenced in other proceedings, have not been addressed. https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/12907846\r\n\r\n2023 Pending Smart Meter Deployment by Investor-Owned Utilities:\r\n\r\nMA investor-owned utilities have been authorized by the MA DPU to deploy smart meters in their service territories. At the same time, health harm and disability has been reported in other jurisdictions where the meters were installed, including California, now extending for over a decade.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this FOIA request is:\r\n\r\n1. to determine whether or not the MA DPU and the Attorney General's office are basing health and safety justification for this investment decision by ratepayers on the 2014 testimony, or whether the DPU has revisited and/or monitored developments in RF/EMF research, including the court ruling requiring the FCC to justify why it has not revisited its 1996 exposure guidelines. Note that documented smart meter injuries were included in evidence submitted to the court. Testimony submitted to the DPU for https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/12907846 and https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/12639808 outlines this issue.\r\n\r\n2. to determine if potential smart meter vendors or utilities have disclosed the incidence of adverse health effects to the MA DPU or the AGO, including the acute onset of electrical sensitivity and/or if the MA DPU has accounted for the consequences to vulnerable ratepayers in its business case.\r\n\r\n3. to determine if the DPU's plan for utilities to offer an 'opt out' is based on accurate assumptions, and whether or not it will adequately protect all ratepayers\r\n\r\n4. to determine what correspondence/if any, took place between the AGO and the DPU regarding the safety of wireless smart utility meters and health, including complaints reported during the Worcester National Grid smart meter pilot program, financed by ratepayers.\r\n\r\n5. to determine whether or not the Attorney General was aware of or concurs with claims made in the 2014 order DPU 12-76-B, including the fraudulent implication that FCC limits are protective of non-thermal effects of RF exposures, or if the Attorney General's office concurs with the implication that the plan to deploy smart meters in MA protects the health and safety of all ratepayers. \r\n\r\nIf the AGO has not provided any advocacy for MA residents in response to health and safety concerns about smart meters during the Baker and Healey administrations and has no concerns about the impending deployment, please note that. \r\n\r\n\r\nI request that this FOIA correspondence be added to the public record for the MA dockets that refer to smart meters, time of use billing, grid modernization, and other relevant proceedings, including but not limited to MA DPU: 11-129, 13-83, 14-109, 15-21, 16-28, 17-53, 18-28, 20-69, 21-80, 20-81, and 21-82.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the DPU's mission statement notes that it seeks to promote safety, security, reliability of service, affordability, equity, and greenhouse gas emission reductions. https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-public-utilities\r\n\r\nRegarding the AGO, \"Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell\u2019s Office is an advocate and resource for the people of Massachusetts in many ways, including protecting consumers, combating fraud and corruption, investigating and prosecuting crime, and protecting the environment, workers, and civil rights.\"\r\n\r\nFees\r\n\r\nI request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and made in the process of news gathering, and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

On behalf of CBS News, the Center for Investigative Reporting, and The Trace, we hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nA data file in machine-readable format such as excel or csv, containing one row for every firearm sold, traded, exchanged, or bartered to any law enforcement officers, private individuals, federal firearms licensees (FFLs), or other businesses by the New Castle County Police Department County sheriff's department.\r\n\r\nWe request the data contain the following fields:\r\n- Date of the transaction\r\n- Firearm serial number\r\n- Name of the person or business who received the departmental weapon\r\n- Weapon manufacturer\r\n- Weapon model\r\n- Weapon type (pistol, rifle, shotgun, etc.)\r\n- Weapon caliber\r\n- Sale price or trade credit amount\r\n\r\nExamples of such transactions are: \r\n- An officer is given their duty weapon when they retire or leave the department, or an officer is allowed to purchase their duty weapon from the department. \r\n- The department auctions used departmental weapons to members of the public to raise funds for purchases of new weapons.\r\n- The department sells or trades used departmental weapons to an FFL or other business to raise funds for the purchases of new weapons or offset the cost of the purchase of new weapons.\r\n- The department exchanges use departmental weapons to a firearms manufacturer or wholesaler as part of an exchange program in exchange for new weapons.\r\n\r\nWe request all such records in the department's possession created since January 1, 2000.\r\n\r\nThis request is for departmental weapons used by department employees, not firearms recovered by the department or those that were used in crimes. These records are not associated with any crime under investigation by the department, and therefore their release would not interfere with any ongoing investigation. \r\n\r\nThis request is part of a data gathering initiative by CBS News and The Trace. Identical requests are being sent to over 100 police departments across the United States.\r\n\r\nWe understand that every department has different information systems, public records policies, records retention schedules, manpower limitations, and other considerations that may impact the your agency's ability to respond to certain parts of this request. \r\n\r\nWe understand that most agencies will have migrated databases at least once between January 1, 2006 and the date this request is fulfilled. If that is the case with your agency please provide records from whatever databases you are readily able to retrieve data from. \r\n\r\nAs most state public records laws require, if the records are kept in electronic format, we request the records be provided to us in their original electronic format. If not, we will accept hard copies of records. \r\n\r\nIf your agency assesses any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform us if the cost exceeds $100. However, if your state records law permits, we hereby request a waiver of all fees on the grounds that this request is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public's understanding of government operations. \r\n\r\nThis request is submitted on behalf of CBS News and The Trace \u2014 news media organizations investigating firearms-related topics for newsgathering purposes. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIf access to the requested records will take longer than the timeline allowed under Delaware Freedom of Information Act, please contact us with information about when we may expect the request to be fulfilled. We understand this is a large request and are happy to work with you to agree to extensions as needed, and will accept records in installments over a period of time. \r\n\r\nIf you deny any part of this request, we ask that you cite each specific statutory exemption you feel justifies your refusal to release the requested information and notify us of the appeal procedures available to us under Delaware Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 15 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJonathan Rudenberg, a citizen of Delaware, in coordination with Rachel Gold.",

Burns Dated 04/01/2021 \u2013 04/30/2023.\r\n\r\nThe term \"Summary of Oral Decisions\" refers to the official opinions issued by the immigration court in the form of concise summaries, intended for the convenience of the parties involved. These summaries aim to capture the essential points of oral decisions made during specific proceedings. It's important to note that these summaries are not meant to replace the original oral decisions but rather to serve as supplementary aids for better comprehension.\r\n\r\nRegarding the specific request for \"oral decision of immigration judge John Burns\" with the IJ code \"JHB,\" I understand that due to an ongoing backlog, locating Summaries of Decisions that have not yet been electronically filed could be challenging at this time. For this reason, I am requesting the production of all eROPs (electronically stored Summaries of Decisions) for the sake of efficiency. This request is made on behalf of the Deportation Accountability Project, a non-profit organization that aims to make deportation data publicly accessible. These records will be made available on our website, www.deportationaccountabilityproject.org.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request that if one aspect of this request will take significantly longer than the other, please release the documents as they become accessible.\r\nWe would appreciate your assistance in randomly selecting 50 eROPs while ensuring the exclusion of any 'Summary of Oral Decisions' associated with Absentia Orders of Removal and 'MOTION TO TERMINATE REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS.\r\nWe hold a specific interest in the respondent's country of origin, namely China, India, and Bangladesh.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k), I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this request for records.

Please read this email in its entirety for important information about upcoming improvements to the EOIR Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) request process.\r\n\r\nAs of December 1, 2022, EOIR no longer accepts FOIA or PA requests by email. EOIR strongly encourages individuals to submit FOIA and PA requests through EOIR's Public Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>. We will continue to monitor this inbox for correspondence other than initial FOIA requests.\r\n\r\nPAL offers several benefits for individuals submitting a FOIA or PA request to EOIR:\r\n\r\n  *   Nearly instant submission of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to track status of requests;\r\n  *   Ability to browse the FOIA Reading Room;\r\n  *   Payment of required fees online;\r\n  *   Response to requests immediately upon processing;\r\n  *   Receive email alerts as soon as requested records are ready; and\r\n  *   Downloadable records at any time after processing.\r\nTo submit your FOIA or PA request, visit PAL<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx> to register for an account.\r\n\r\nPAL provides accelerated processing and delivery of EOIR\u2019s response to your FOIA requests, but we understand it may not be right for everyone. If you prefer, you may still send your requests via postal mail. The mailing address for the EOIR FOIA Service Center is available at https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the Request an ROP<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest> process is available to those requesting a Record of Proceeding (ROP) for a case before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The Request an ROP process allows an individual who is the subject of a ROP, or someone with a specific legal relationship with that person, to submit an ROP request directly to the applicable immigration court or the BIA, rather than to the FOIA team. Requesters may use the Request an ROP process in lieu of or in addition to the FOIA request process. However, please note that requesting an ROP through both processes may result in significantly delayed delivery. For more information, see the ROP Request Instructions<https://www.justice.gov/eoir/ROPrequest>.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that if you have multiple accounts, which could be connected to PAL requests or e-mail/mail requests, we will no longer merge the accounts together. Therefore, it is to your advantage to use your currently existing PAL account (or create a PAL account if you do not have one) and only submit requests under that PAL account moving forward.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to offering you faster processing times with PAL, although due to the large number of requests we receive, there may still be a slight delay in processing your request. We apologize for this inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to monitor this email for communications regarding existing requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFOIA Service Center\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review\r\nPublic Access Link (PAL)<https://foia.eoir.justice.gov/app/Home.aspx>",

I am making  a request for a copy \r\nof the  Airworthiness certificates for Singapore Airlines which is refer to Singapore Airline Limited and registration number:9V-SKJ.\r\n\r\n  Subject :Airworthiness Certification Overview\r\n\r\nAn airworthiness certificate is an FAA document which grants authorization to operate an aircraft in flight.A registered owner or owner's agent of an aircraft may apply for an airworthiness certificate.\r\n\r\nLegally, these documents and certificates must be inside the aircraft, and the airworthiness certificate needs to be on display where passengers can see it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the FAA rules:\r\n\r\n129.13 Airworthiness and registration certificates.\r\n(a) No foreign air carrier may operate any aircraft within the United States unless that aircraft carries a current registration certificate and displays the nationality and registration markings of the State of Registry, and an airworthiness certificate issued or validated by:\r\n\r\n(1) The State of Registry; or\r\n\r\n(2) The State of the Operator, provided that the State of the Operator and the State of Registry have entered into an agreement under Article 83bis of the Convention on International Civil Aviation that covers the aircraft.\r\n\r\n(b) No foreign air carrier may operate a foreign aircraft within the United States except in accordance with the limitations on maximum certificated weights prescribed for that aircraft and that operation by the country of manufacture of the aircraft.\r\n\r\nInternational Field Offices (IFOs)\r\nKey IFO Functions\r\nAuthorize operations to the United States by foreign air carriers\r\nApprove maintenance programs and MELs and authorize certain other operations for U.S. registered aircraft used by foreign air carriers\r\nConduct surveillance of foreign air carriers operating into the United States\r\nConduct certification and surveillance of U.S. Foreign Repair Stations.\r\n\r\nAIRCRAFT CERTIFICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe FAA issues different certifications for aircraft depending on their purpose. The maintenance requirements for these different types of uses vary, so it\u2019s crucial to know which one you\u2019re applying for and how to keep up with the right maintenance:\r\n\r\nStandard Airworthiness \u2014 The FAA approves applications for a standard airworthiness certificate if your registered aircraft complies with one of the following aircraft categories: normal, commuter, utility, transport or acrobatic. You must also maintain a condition that\u2019s safe for operation, as well as conduct preventative maintenance \u2014 any modifications you make to your aircraft must meet the requirements of 14 CFR Parts 21, 43 and 91.\r\n\r\nSpecial Airworthiness \u2014 The FAA issues special airworthiness certificates for primary, restricted, multiple, limited, experimental, provisional and special flight aircraft. To qualify for this certificate, your aircraft must meet several standards detailed in 14 CFR Part 21, 45, 48, 91 and 375, as well as policies that specify additional aircraft maintenance requirements.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I am making  a request  for a copy of  the Airworthiness certificates for Singapore Airlines which is refer to Singapore Airline Limited and the registration number:9V-SKJ.\r\n\r\nSubject :Airworthiness Certification Overview\r\n\r\nAn airworthiness certificate is an FAA document which grants authorization to operate an aircraft in flight.  A registered owner or owner's agent of an aircraft may apply for an airworthiness certificate.\r\n\r\nLegally, these documents and certificates must be inside the aircraft, and the airworthiness certificate needs to be on display where passengers can see it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the FAA rules:\r\n\r\n129.13 Airworthiness and registration certificates.\r\n(a) No foreign air carrier may operate any aircraft within the United States unless that aircraft carries a current registration certificate and displays the nationality and registration markings of the State of Registry, and an airworthiness certificate issued or validated by:\r\n\r\n(1) The State of Registry; or\r\n\r\n(2) The State of the Operator, provided that the State of the Operator and the State of Registry have entered into an agreement under Article 83bis of the Convention on International Civil Aviation that covers the aircraft.\r\n\r\n(b) No foreign air carrier may operate a foreign aircraft within the United States except in accordance with the limitations on maximum certificated weights prescribed for that aircraft and that operation by the country of manufacture of the aircraft.\r\n\r\nAIRCRAFT CERTIFICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe FAA issues different certifications for aircraft depending on their purpose. The maintenance requirements for these different types of uses vary, so it\u2019s crucial to know which one you\u2019re applying for and how to keep up with the right maintenance:\r\n\r\nStandard Airworthiness \u2014 The FAA approves applications for a standard airworthiness certificate if your registered aircraft complies with one of the following aircraft categories: normal, commuter, utility, transport or acrobatic. You must also maintain a condition that\u2019s safe for operation, as well as conduct preventative maintenance \u2014 any modifications you make to your aircraft must meet the requirements of 14 CFR Parts 21, 43 and 91.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCharlemagne Limage",
