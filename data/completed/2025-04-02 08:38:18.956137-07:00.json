This basic information is attached to this message and is provided free of charge. The date of birth of any living person is excepted from required public disclosure under common-law privacy. Paxton v. City of Dallas, No. 03-13-00546-CV, 2015 Tex. App. LEXIS 5228, at *10 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin May 22, 2015, pet. denied) (mem. op.)\u00a0 The Department has received a previous determination from the Attorney General\u2019s office allowing us to redact the dates of birth of living individuals from the records we are providing to you without requesting a ruling. Open Records Letter Ruling 2015-27249; see Gov\u2019t Code\u00a7 552.301(a); see also Open Records Decision No. 673 at 7 (2001). We have redacted the social security number of one or more living individuals excepted from disclosure by section 552.147 of the Government Code, as section 552.147(b) authorizes a governmental body to redact this information without the necessity of requesting a decision from the attorney general. The information you requested contains information that relates to: \r\na motor vehicle operator\u2019s or driver\u2019s license or permit issued by an agency of this state or another state or country; or a motor vehicle title or registration issued by an agency of this state or another state or country; or a personal identification document issued by an agency of this state or another state or country or a local agency authorized to issue an identification document. \r\n\r\nThis information is confidential under section 552.130 of the Texas Government Code.\u00a0 Our office is prohibited by law from releasing this information to you, and therefore we have removed this information from the enclosed information we are providing to you. \r\n\r\nNormally, we must request a ruling from the Texas Attorney General before we can withhold any of the information you requested.\u00a0 However, section 552.130 allows us to withhold this specific information without requesting a ruling from the attorney general. \r\n\r\nYou have the right to appeal our decision to withhold this information from you. Instructions for appeal are at the end of this letter.\u00a0 If you do not want to appeal, you do not need to do anything else.\u00a0 Please note that we are only withholding the specific categories of information that are confidential under section 552.130.\u00a0 We will process the rest of your request for information in accordance with the terms of the Public Information Act. How to Appeal the Withholding of Information Under 552.130 Without an AG Ruling Requested \r\n\r\nIf you wish to appeal the withholding of information discussed on the previous page, you must send the following to the attorney general: \r\n\r\n(1) a signed, written statement indicating your wish to appeal the withholding of information; \r\n(2) the name of the governmental body that withheld information from you; \r\n(3) the date you made your original request for information; and \r\n(4) a copy of your original request for information, or if you are unable to provide a copy, a description of your original request for information. \r\n\r\nYou may also submit written comments stating why you think the information should be released to you, but you are not required to do so. \r\n\r\nSend your appeal by mail to the attorney general at: \r\n\r\nOpen Records Division \r\nPO Box 12548 \r\nAustin, Texas 78711-2548 \r\n\r\nWithin forty-five business days after receiving all of the above-listed items necessary to file your appeal, the attorney general will issue a written ruling on the matter.\u00a0 You will receive a copy of this ruling in the mail. \r\nFor\u00a0questions or additional information, please reply to this email.

Any policy, guidance, handbook, manual, or standard contract concerning the institution\u2019s interactions or relationship with members of the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\n2. Any policy, guidance, handbook, or manual concerning the interactions or communications of institutional employees, including faculty, administrators, staff, and student employees, with the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by 1 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 408(6). The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnne Marie Tamburro",

Laws ch. 933), I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nWe are Economics Professors in the College of Business at Ferris State University, and are engaged in an empirical research project on police behavior and citizen complaints. This project requires us to request data from your department. If you have questions about this request or suggestions, we would be happy to discuss them with you.\r\n\r\nWe have located the Rochester professional stands section of the annual report for 2011-2015. If you can send us that report for 2007-2010 and 2016-2017, then you can omit numbers #1 and #2 of our request. \r\n\r\n1. What is the total number of citizen complaints (allegations of misconduct) made against your department\u2019s officers annually for the last 10 years? If your department logs complaints in a database, spreadsheet, or other log, a copy of those logs is fine instead.\r\nPlease include the type of complaint (i.e., use of force, abuse language, unwarranted search) and the result of complaint (i.e., sustained, exonerated).\r\n2. What is the total number of complaints police officers made against their peer officers in department annually for the last 10 years? If your department logs complaints in a database, spreadsheet, or other log, a copy of those logs is fine instead.\r\nPlease include the type of complaint (i.e., use of force, abuse language, unwarranted search) and the result of complaint (i.e., sustained, exonerated).\r\n3. What is the annual number of officers involved in shootings in your department for the past 10 years? Any documentation or reports that detail the annual number of officer-involved shootings in your department for the past 10 years would be sufficient.\r\nPlease include documentation regarding how many of these officer-involved shootings involved disciplinary action. (Please list officer firearm discharge directed at a person separately from a shooting involving an animal and separately from accidental firearm discharges).\r\nPlease include the number of officer-involved shootings resulting in discipline.\r\n4. Which of the above data are published publicly? Please provide a link to any and all publicly available reports containing the data above.\r\nCollecting this information is very important to our research, so we would like to emphasize, if you have questions about my request or suggestions, we would be happy to discuss them with you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlexander Cartwright and Jennifer Dirmeyer",

Could you please provide that data? If not, could you please clarify that your department does not collect OIS (officer involved shooting) data. \r\n\r\nIf you are able to provide the data, please define what constitutes an officer-involved shooting in your department. For example, some departments do not count misses while others count all discharges; some include shots at animals.  Other departments include intentional and accidental shootings; others do not. Please explain to us how your department classifies the OIS included in the numbers you sent to us. \r\n\r\nRespectfully, -Alex Cartwright \r\n",

However, multiple publicly available reports, including a criminal complaint, state that the arrest occurred in Minnesota on November 14, 2024, following an incident at or near the Rosedale Mall Lululemon location, which is within Ramsey County.\r\n\r\nGiven the serious nature of the charges and the scale of the alleged thefts across multiple states, I would sincerely appreciate your assistance in clarifying the following:\r\n\r\n1. Was the Ramsey County Sheriff\u2019s Office involved in any part of the arrest, detention, booking, or evidence handling in this case?\r\n2. If not, could you kindly confirm whether the responsible agency may have been Roseville Police, Woodbury Police, or another jurisdiction such as Washington or Hennepin County?\r\n3. If available, can you share any related incident number, jail log, or arrest entry that might help redirect this request to the appropriate agency?\r\n\r\nThis request is made in the public interest. Thank you again for your time and assistance in helping locate the correct agency or data custodian for this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\nPolice Cam News\r\n",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Ernesto Cardenal.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Collection and search for records from a facility outside of this office. \r\n2. Volume of records that may be responsive to your request. \r\n3. Consultation with one or more agencies having a substantial interest in the determination or the subject matter. \r\n\r\nThe Navy FOIA program is decentralized, requiring our office to search and gather documents from Navy component offices which are not geographically co-located. Per the Department of the Navy FOIA/PA regulation 32 CFR \u00a7701.8(g)(2), this office grants itself an extension of ten days response time.

All communications regarding this request are public and will be disclosed as appropriate.\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Oregon Public Records Law (ORS 192.311 \u2013 192.478), I request access to the following records related to Sidney Mecham\u2019s arrest, investigation, and prosecution for driving through the closed Rose Festival Grand Floral Parade on June 10, 2023. Mecham was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, making all related law enforcement records subject to public disclosure.\r\n\r\nI formally demand the preservation of all responsive records, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tBody-worn camera footage\r\n\t\u2022\tDashcam recordings\r\n\t\u2022\t911 call recordings and transcripts\r\n\t\u2022\tPolice dispatch logs\r\n\t\u2022\tArrest reports and investigative files\r\n\t\u2022\tInternal police communications related to the case\r\n\r\nDestroying, altering, or withholding these records without legal justification could constitute a violation of public records law and a due process violation under Chaudhry v. City of Los Angeles, 751 F.3d 1096 (9th Cir. 2014). Further, Public Citizen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989) reaffirms the public\u2019s right to government transparency.\r\n\r\n1. Body-Worn Camera (BWC) Footage\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll footage from officers who responded to Sidney Mecham\u2019s incident on June 10, 2023.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 133.741 requires law enforcement to retain and disclose BWC footage unless exempt.\r\n\t\u2022\tACLU of Nevada v. City of Las Vegas, 333 F.3d 1092 (9th Cir. 2003) confirmed that police bodycam recordings are subject to public records laws.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 133.741\r\n\r\n2. Dashcam Footage\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll police vehicle dashcam recordings related to Mecham\u2019s arrest.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 192.345(3) requires disclosure of police video records unless they interfere with an active case, which is not applicable here.\r\n\t\u2022\tHayden v. City of Portland, 183 Or App 647 (2002) established mandatory disclosure of non-exempt police records.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.345(3)\r\n\r\n3. 911 Call Recordings and Transcripts\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll 911 call recordings and transcripts related to Mecham\u2019s actions and arrest.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 192.345(3) states that 911 calls are public records unless an exemption applies.\r\n\t\u2022\tState v. Worthington, 138 Or App 104 (1995) upheld that 911 call transcripts must be disclosed unless privacy outweighs public interest.\r\n\t\u2022\tReference: ORS 192.345(3)\r\n\r\n4. Police Dispatch Audio and Transcripts\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\n\t\u2022\tAll officer-dispatch communications related to Sidney Mecham\u2019s arrest.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis:\r\n\t\u2022\tORS 192.311 provides for the disclosure of police communication records.\r\n\t\u2022\tNew York Times Co. v.

City of Portland, 183 Or App 647 (2002) established mandatory disclosure of non-exempt police records. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.345(3) \r\n\r\n3. 911 Call Recordings and Transcripts \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\u2022 All 911 call recordings and transcripts related to Mecham\u2019s actions and arrest. \r\n\r\nLegal Basis: \r\n\u2022 ORS 192.345(3) states that 911 calls are public records unless an exemption applies. \r\n\u2022 State v. Worthington, 138 Or App 104 (1995) upheld that 911 call transcripts must be disclosed unless privacy outweighs public interest. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.345(3) \r\n\r\n4.

NASA, 852 F.2d 602 (D.C. Cir. 1988) affirmed that public agencies must disclose internal communications unless an exemption applies. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.311 \r\n\r\n5. Arrest and Booking Reports \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\u2022 Complete arrest and booking reports related to Mecham\u2019s case, including officer narratives. \r\n\r\nLegal Basis: \r\n\u2022 ORS 192.345(3) mandates disclosure of completed law enforcement reports. \r\n\u2022 Afshar v. Dept. of State, 702 F.2d 1125 (D.C. Cir. 1983) held that agencies must disclose non-exempt portions of law enforcement records. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.345(3) \r\n\r\n6. Investigative Case Files & Final Police Reports \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\u2022 All finalized investigative reports, officer statements, and internal police memos regarding the Mecham case. \r\n\r\nLegal Basis: \r\n\u2022 ORS 192.345(3) confirms that records in closed cases are subject to public disclosure. \r\n\u2022 Landano v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 508 U.S. 165 (1993) held that FBI investigative reports must be disclosed unless explicitly exempted. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.345(3) \r\n\r\n7. Mugshot and Booking Photos \r\n\r\nRequested Records: \r\n\u2022 Any official mugshot taken of Sidney Mecham at the time of his arrest. \r\n\r\nLegal Basis: \r\n\u2022 ORS 192.355 allows for the disclosure of booking photos unless explicitly exempted. \r\n\u2022 Detroit Free Press v. DOJ, 829 F.3d 478 (6th Cir. 2016) held that mugshots are public records unless there is a compelling exemption. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.355 \r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver \r\n\r\nPursuant to ORS 192.324(5), I request a waiver of all fees as this request serves the public interest in promoting transparency regarding law enforcement actions and public safety policies. \r\n\u2022 Public Citizen v. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989) held that government information disclosure fosters accountability. \r\n\u2022 Reference: ORS 192.324(5) \r\n\r\nPreservation of Records \r\n\r\nI formally demand that all responsive records be preserved under: \r\n\u2022 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3106 (prohibiting unlawful destruction of public records). \r\n\u2022 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (ensuring preservation of records subject to FOIA requests). \r\n\r\nConclusion \r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide: \r\n\u2022 A written explanation citing the specific FOIA exemptions invoked. \r\n\u2022 All segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. \r\n\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request and provide an estimated timeline for processing. If clarification is needed, I can be reached at Jordan@Lassiter.eu. \r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nJordan Lassiter \r\nInvestigative Journalist \r\nJordan@Lassiter.eu \r\nYou requested a fee waiver. \u00a0The City considered the information you provided and evaluated whether providing the requested records would primarily benefit the public then balanced that interest against the burden to the Police Bureau.\u00a0 Even if the City assumed that you articulated a public interest, the burden on the Police Bureau to research and provide the requested records outweighs the public interest. Therefore your fee waiver is denied and payment is required for the requested records. \r\nSincerely, \r\nRyan Rees \r\nPortland Police Bureau - Digital & Public Records Unit 503-823-0756 \r\nIf you are having technical difficulties with the website, please contact the website administrator by phone or email. \u00a0(503) 823-6040 or prrhelp@portlandoregon.gov",

\r\n\r\n--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n\r\nRE: Public Records Requests of February 25, 2025 Reference # C384715-022525 \r\n\r\nDear Jordan, \r\nThe City\u00a0of Portland received a Public Records Request from you on February 25, 2025 for the following: \"Jordan Lassiter \r\nFebruary 23, 2025 \r\n\r\n..... \r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nJordan Lassiter \r\nInvestigative Journalist \r\nJordan@Lassiter.eu \r\n\r\nThe police report and subjects dash cam videos are attached or available online at the Portland Public Records Request Center by going to \"My Public Records Request Center\" - \"View My Requests\" - and clicking the button \"View Files.\" \r\nI also found a surveillance video and an air unit video that I included. \r\nIf there's issues downloading the large files, let me know.\u00a0 Instead of a single 64gb file, I put them in a zip for each dash folder.\u00a0 I can split them up more but figured I'd send as is for first try. \r\nThe City now considers your request fulfilled and it will be closed.\u00a0 Please note, messages sent on closed requests will not be monitored. Ability to Appeal: \r\nIf you were denied the right to inspect or to receive a copy of any public record of the City of Portland you may seek review of the public body's determination pursuant to ORS 192.401, 192.411, 192.415, 192.418, 192.422, 192.427 and 192.431. \r\nSincerely, \r\nJeff Cammack \r\nPortland Police Bureau - Digital & Public Records 503-823-0756 If you are having technical difficulties with the website, please contact the website administrator by phone or email. \u00a0(503) 823-6040 or prrhelp@portlandoregon.gov",

        "communication": "Dear FOIL Appeals Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing in regard to Freedom of Information Law request sent to the City on 05/03/2022 (attached.)\r\n\r\nPlease consider this a formal appeal under Public Officers Law 89(4)(A) of the constructive denial of that request. I say constructive denial because the City has simply failed to respond in a timely manner to my request.\r\n\r\nIn a FOIL request I submitted on 05/03/2022 I asked for \u201cAll communications in your possession, of any type whatsoever, to and from the Five-Borough Chamber Alliance and/or its members, including but not limited to Lisa Sorin, President of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce; Randy Peers, President and CEO of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce; Jessica Walker, President and CEO of the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce; Tom Grech, President and CEO of the Queens Chamber of Commerce; and Linda Baran, President and CEO of the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been more than two years. To date, I have received neither the records sought nor a denial of the request. I received recognition of my FOIL request but have not received further communication, the requested documents, or a denial.\r\n\r\nThe city's approach to my request is simply unlawful. It is inconsistent with both the language and intent of FOIL.\r\n\r\nAs the state\u2019s Committee on Open Government, tasked with interpreting FOIL matters, has said, under FOIL, \u201can agency cannot engage in one delay after another.\u201d FOIL AO-18008(Feb. 22, 2010). Yet, this is exactly how the city council has responded to my request, sending me only one correspondence.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Public Officers Law 89(3)(a), as amended by the Legislature in 2005, an agency must within five business days of receipt of a written request for records make the record sought available, deny access and give reasons for the denial, or furnish an acknowledgement of receipt and state the approximate date when the request will be dealt with. The statute further specifies that the approximate date for addressing a request on its merits should not exceed 20 business days from the date of the acknowledgement of the receipt of the request. A failure by an agency to conform to this statutorily mandated time frame constitutes a constructive denial. See Public Officers Law 89(4)(a). The statute was written as such to ensure FOIL requestors are not, as here, subjected to endless delays by agencies that choose to open their files to the public (which was precisely why FOIL was passed in the first place).\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Committee on Open Government makes clear that \u201cin the rare situation in which it is found that more than 20 additional business days are needed [to address the merits of a request], the agency may do so, with an explanation of the reason for the delay and an indication of a \u201cdate certain,\u201d a self-imposed deadline by which it will grant access to the records in whole or in part (see regulations of the Committee on Open Government, 21 NYCRR 1401.5). When the date certain is reasonable in consideration of attendant facts and circumstances, the agency would be complying with law. There is no provision that permits agencies to indicate extension after extension.\u201d FOIL AO-18008 (emphasis added). See also FOIL-AO 16095 (Dec. 13, 2007) (noting that \u201cthe amendments [to FOIL] clearly are intended to prohibit agencies from unnecessarily delaying disclosure.\u201d). A series of generic notifications over a period of months saying that a response is forthcoming does not meet this standard under FOIL.\r\n\r\nFurther, as recognized by the New York Court of Appeals, FOIL itself contains \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s own unmistakably broad declaration that \u2026 it is incumbent upon the state and its localities to extend public accountability wherever and whenever feasible.\u201d Westchester Newspapers, Inc. v Kimball, 50 NY2d 575,579 (1980) (emphasis added), quoting Section 84 of FOIL. Therefore, where, as here, records are clearly available to the public under FOIL, or are readily retrievable, there may be no basis for a delay in disclosures.\r\n\r\nAs I know of no grounds in FOIL for the denial of the request, and the city has given none, I ask that this appeal be granted and that the records sought be produced promptly.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nJake Offenhartz\r\nAssociated Press\r\n212 621 1605",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Tennessee Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI respectfully request access to and copies of all records pertaining to the arrest of Tarius Sledge on September 20, 2022, at East Ridge High School in East Ridge, Tennessee. Mr. Sledge, an 18-year-old student, was involved in an altercation with School Resource Deputy (SRD) Tyler McRae during a gym class session. The incident escalated when Mr. Sledge allegedly refused to comply with instructions, leading to a physical confrontation that included SRD McRae pulling Mr. Sledge by his hair and deploying pepper spray. This event was partially captured on video, which subsequently circulated widely on social media platforms.\r\n\r\nI am seeking the following records related to this incident:\r\n\r\nAll available body-worn camera footage from SRD Tyler McRae and any other officers present during the incident, including the entirety of the interaction with Mr. Sledge.\r\nAll available surveillance footage from East Ridge High School's gymnasium and surrounding areas capturing the incident.\r\nThe complete incident and arrest reports, including all officer narratives, supplemental reports, and witness statements from school staff, students, and other individuals present.\r\nAll 911 call recordings and dispatch logs related to this incident, including radio communications and Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) reports.\r\nAny photographs taken by the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office during or after the incident, including images of Mr. Sledge, the involved officers, and the location of the altercation.\r\nThe full arrest affidavits and any related charging documents filed in this case.\r\nAny internal reviews, use-of-force reports, or investigations conducted by the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office regarding this incident.\r\nAny press releases, social media posts, or official statements made by the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office or East Ridge High School regarding this incident.\r\nThe primary goal of this request is to serve the public interest by making these records publicly accessible. While I acknowledge that I may also generate revenue from disseminating these materials, the request primarily aims to enhance transparency regarding this law enforcement incident.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees associated with fulfilling this request, as disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding of law enforcement practices and actions within educational settings. However, if a full fee waiver is not possible, please inform me of the estimated costs in advance. Additionally, if fees can be reduced or eliminated by excluding certain records, please specify which records those would be.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records in an electronic format if available. If any portions of this request are denied, please cite the specific legal exemption(s) and provide a redacted version of the document where applicable.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKent Hoover, a citizen of Tennessee, in coordination with Police Cam News.",

If you have requested only paper documentation, these do not require a charge unless the report is length or requires significant redaction. \r\n3. Florida Statute 119 does not require a governmental body to create new information, to do legal research, or to answer questions. \r\nIf any of the above factors change your request, you can reply to this email with the modifications you would like to make.

Additionally, if certain records are only partially exempt, I request that the non-exempt portions be disclosed after appropriate redaction, as stipulated by the Florida Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request and provide an estimated timeline for its fulfillment. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Village personnel applied for the Organized Retail Crime Grant through an online portal administered by the Illinois Attorney General\u2019s Office.  We are not sure how other law enforcement agencies completed an application.  They may have prepared a paper application or have print-outs from the Attorney General\u2019s online portal.  But the Village of La Grange does not.  We cannot provide you records we do not have.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you desire to see the application materials completed in the online portal, you may want to submit a request to the Illinois Attorney General\u2019s Office.  We assume that the Attorney General\u2019s Office has copies of all information submitted.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DB9500.D12604F0]\r\n\r\nDaisy Cabrera\r\nExecutive Assistant\r\nVillage of La Grange\r\n53 S.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. If you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-338-1050 or by email at Erinstewart@cfjj.org. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Stewart\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",
