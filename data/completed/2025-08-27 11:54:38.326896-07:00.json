Data on individuals currently on parole from NDCS is available on our website (corrections.nebraska.gov) through the Incarceration Records database.   A link to this database is located on homepage in the right-hand menu.  If you select \"Download All\" on the searchable database, a pop-up window will appear that will give you the opportunity to download spreadsheets of information from the database.  A direct link to that pop-up is https://dcs-inmatesearch.ne.gov/Corrections/COR_download.htm.  Selecting \"Download Active\" from this pop-up window will generate spreadsheets of data on individuals with active NDCS files.  This data can be filtered by institutional release type to only include individuals released onto parole.  The NDCS database does not maintain data on whether or not an individual is on the sex offender registry.  You may wish to obtain this data from another source and compare it to active NDCS parolees.  Probation for the State of Nebraska is under the jurisdiction of the Nebraska Supreme Court.  NDCS therefore does not maintain data on current probationers.  You may wish to reach out to the Nebraska Supreme Court to request such data.\r\nSincerely,\r\nKathleen Kokensparger\r\nPublic Records Manager | CENTRAL OFFICE\r\n\r\nNebraska Department of Correctional Services\r\nOFFICE   402-479-5767\r\nFAX       402-479-5623\r\nkathleen.kokensparger@nebraska.gov<https://mail.nebraska.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=V4pR88jIRUVzu0a_BEeYhUyMGoCTp3IRG0H1EFpsaE6smBMvij7WCA..&URL=mailto%3akathleen.kokensparger%40nebraska.gov>\r\ncorrections.nebraska.gov<https://mail.nebraska.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=3tXpjzPHdUgAAM5iZyaZ3A-T_EDw-34iGlngmLlnenGsmBMvij7WCA..&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.corrections.nebraska.gov%2f> |Facebook<https://mail.nebraska.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=hn51PO6-_gxC6CQ3djTJOQtClorILZHLDNrGqpqA6yqsmBMvij7WCA..&URL=https%3a%2f%2fwww.facebook.com%2fNECorrections> | Twitter<https://mail.nebraska.gov/owa/redir.aspx?C=_qR2HZ-wRPgar_KdQgXT6ZkSlPKcTwIulVjNFAxYVmKsmBMvij7WCA..&URL=https%3a%2f%2ftwitter.com%2fNECorrections>\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Any letter sent by Interim United States Attorney Ed Martin containing the words \"I receive requests\". \r\n\r\n2. Any communications sent to or from United States Attorney Ed Martin which mention \"Wikimedia\", \"Wikipedia\", \"Wiki\", or *wiki* (i.e., using asterisks as wildcards such that a search would return, e.g., https://wikipedia.org/). \r\n\r\nThis request is limited to letters or communications sent to or received by Martin on or after January 20, 2025.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.5(e)(1)(ii) and (iv) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and academic freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\nThe Department has previously granted FIRE expedited processing in a related request. See Request No. EOUSA-2025-003687 (Apr. 24, 2025).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely an Interim United States Attorney's practice of sending letters seeking \"information\" for speech protected by the First Amendment. Specifically, Ed Martin has sent letters to (a) Georgetown University Law Center concerning its faculty members' classroom teaching (https://www.ncronline.org/files/2025-03/3.7.24%20Ed%20Martin%20letter%20%20to%20Georgetown%20law.pdf); (b) U.S. Sen. Charles E. Schumer concerning U.S. Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil M. Gorsuch (https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/19/ed-martin-dc-letters-schumer-garcia/); (c) U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia concerning comments made about Elon Musk (https://bsky.app/profile/robertgarcia.bsky.social/post/3lin33orhnk2r); and (d) a medical journal's editor (https://x.com/_Eric_Reinhart/status/1912958244768690407).  This request cocnerns an additional letter Martin sent to Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ocNyx34Et19sKtlta0bTPPzSPcpi375T/view).\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.thefp.com/p/trump-prosecutor-threatens-wikipedia\r\nb. https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/05/dc-us-attorney-ed-martin-georgetown-law-dei/\r\nc. https://thepostmillennial.com/us-atty-ed-martin-demands-georgetown-law-school-answer-for-dei-in-curriculum-hiring-and-programs\r\nd. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html\r\ne. https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5181345-georgetown-law-school-dei-trump/\r\nf. https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-appointed-prosecutor-gets-much-needed-refresher-first-amendment-rcna195321\r\ng. https://www.rawstory.com/ed-martin-georgetown-clash/\r\nh. https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology\r\ni. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/ed-martin-us-attorney-dei\r\nj. https://www.newsmax.com/politics/georgetown-dei-william-treanor/2025/03/06/id/1201790/\r\nk. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/federal-fallout/georgetown-law-school-wont-bow-to-dei-threat-from-dcs-acting-federal-prosecutor-ed-martin-donald-trump-william-treanor/65-22ac5a1d-43a8-492b-92db-1f8c6f70f76c\r\nl. https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/03/07/dei-georgetown-us-attorney-first-amendment/81793644007/\r\nm. https://www.washingtonian.com/2025/03/07/william-treanor-georgetown-law-ed-martin-first-amendment/\r\nn. https://abovethelaw.com/2025/03/georgetown-law-to-ed-martin-f-all-the-way-off/\r\no. https://www.thecollegefix.com/top-d-c-federal-prosecutor-says-he-doesnt-want-law-students-from-georgetown-because-of-dei/\r\np. https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/03/georgetown-william-treanor-ed-martin-trump-doj-dei.html\r\nq. https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/19/ed-martin-dc-letters-schumer-garcia/\r\nr. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/us-attorney-justice-dept-schumer-inquiry.html\r\ns.  https://www.mediaite.com/politics/maga-u-s-attorney-sends-letter-to-house-democrat-over-criticism-of-elon-musk-who-you-call-a-dick/\r\nt. https://www.rawstory.com/trump-justice-department-2671190340/\r\nu. https://www.yahoo.com/news/acting-dc-us-attorney-ed-150929791.html\r\nv. https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/21/trumps-dc-us-attorney-launches-project-whirlwind-to-investigate-critics-for-their-speech/\r\n\r\n4. This information is relevant to a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. There is widespread and exceptional media interest in this matter, as reflected in the above articles originating from outlets across the ideological spectrum, including the article published by The Free Press concerning Martin's letter to Wikimedia (https://www.thefp.com/p/trump-prosecutor-threatens-wikipedia). This matter raises \"possible questions\" about government integrity affecting public confidence because the alleged conduct involves a United States Attorney's pressure on educational institutions, academic publications, and elected officials to limit protected speech on matters on public concern. A prominent First Amendment scholar has raised questions about the propriety of Attorney Martin's \"inquiry\" into Georgetown University Law Center due to its curriculum. Eugene Volokh, \"May Government Refuse to Hire Notre Dame Students, Because Notre Dame Teaches and Promotes Anti-Abortion Ideology?\" (Volokh Conspiracy, March 7, 2025), https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology. Further, Attorney Martin's letter to Wikimedia was sent as members of the United States Senate requested disciplinary action against Attorney Martin due to his similar efforts to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment. See https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin's letters are of particular interest because they are relevant to his nomination for the office of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. On April 2, 2025, ten members of the United States Senate sent a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, asking him to schedule a hearing to consider Martin\u2019s nomination. (Letter from Sen. Richard J. Durbin, et al., to Sen. Chuck Grassley, Apr. 2, 2025, available at https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25878847/ed-martin-hearing-letter-4225-final.pdf.)  At least one prominent commentator has cited Martin\u2019s efforts to chill curriculum at Georgetown (among other efforts to chill speech) as a reason for the Senate to refuse to confirm Martin. (Jack Goldsmith, The Senate and the Edward Martin Nomination, Executive Function (Apr. 3, 2025), https://executivefunctions.substack.com/p/the-senate-and-the-edward-martin.) These concerns, raised by prominent intellectual and political leaders, indicate that Martin's letters raise possible questions about the government's integrity.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.10(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by an Interim United States Attorney.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publish a\r\n    number of . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdocument sets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents.

The documents were received by ATF on April 3, 2024, and this referral was assigned ATF tracking number 2024-01020.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence with this office.  For your reference, the FBI file number associated with this request is FBI FOI/PA # 1590533-000. \n\nFor your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:  simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  At this time, your request has been assigned to the Simple track.  You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. \n\nWe determined that you are a representative of the news media pursuant to 5 U.S.C. section  552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).  As such, we are required to assess fees for duplication of responsive records.  See 28 C.F.R. section 16.10(c).  You may review the Department of Justice regulations, which establish the fees charged for processing FOIA requests at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-2015-04-03/2015-07772.  If you disagree with this determination, you are welcome to provide any additional information that would demonstrate that you should not be considered a representative of the news media requester.  If you would like to discuss either the track or the fees associated with your request, please contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390.  You may also discuss any aspect of your request with our FOIA Public Liaison. \n\nSincerely, \n\nElizabeth A. Wood \nActing Chief \nInformation and Privacy Governance Division\n",

We received these documents on April 2, 2024, and this referral was assigned file number PARDONFOIA 2024-308965. Please refer to this number in any future correspondence with this Office. For your reference, the FBI\u2019s file number associated with this request is FBI FOI/PA # 1590533-000.  Please be advised that we have considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions.  After carefully reviewing the clemency-related records maintained in the FBI\u2019s files pertaining to Samuel Loring Morison, we have determined that 62 pages are exempt from disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C) , which concerns records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes the release of which could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, as well as U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) , which also concerns material the release of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. However, we have determined that 1 page is appropriate for release with redactions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) and/or U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). In addition to the records referred by the FBI, we also searched our own files and located 1 page that is responsive to your request and which we have determined is appropriate for release in full.\u202fThe releasable record is a copy of the clemency warrant for Samuel Loring Morison.  Due to the age of the case, this disclosure includes all segregable, nonexempt records within our possession or control. All other records from PARDON\u2019s files have\u202fbeen transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA),\u202fand that agency is now the owner of the records (Records of the Office of the Pardon Attorney: https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/204.html ).\u202fIf you have not done so already, you may wish to submit a request directly to NARA for the records you seek at the following address by using the reference number provided above:   National Archives and Records Administration \r\nSpecial Access and FOIA Staff \r\nNWCTF-Room 6350 \r\n8601 Adelphi Road \r\nCollege Park, MD 20740 \r\n(866) 272-6272   For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c). This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.

Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at sam.levin@theguardian.com or 646-935-9115. \r\n\r\nThanks so much, \r\n\r\nSam Levin",
