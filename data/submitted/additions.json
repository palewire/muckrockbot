Ensuring that DSS\u2019s activities and collaborations with consulting firms like Accenture and Manatt align with federal and state standards is of great public interest.

Prompt access to these records is essential to identify any potential misconduct and prevent ongoing misuse of taxpayer dollars, particularly within critical programs affecting vulnerable populations.\r\n\r\nTime-Sensitive Advocacy Needs: This information is critical for advocacy efforts that inform stakeholders, ensure consumer protection, and foster transparency. Any delay could impede the ability of stakeholders, including advocacy groups and affected individuals, to respond adequately to Medicaid policy changes.\r\n\r\nJustification for Fee Waiver\r\nThis information will serve the public interest by supporting oversight, transparency, and protection for Medicaid recipients, particularly Connecticut\u2019s ABI Waiver participants.

vulnerable Medicaid populations in the following areas:\r\n\r\nMedicaid Program Amendments and Policy Modifications\r\nRecords of amendments to the ABI Waiver Program and other Medicaid waivers managed by Connecticut DSS in consultation with Accenture and Manatt, as reviewed by federal agencies (CMS, HHS).\r\n\r\nMedicaid Landscape Analysis and Managed Care Exploration\r\nDocumentation of data analysis, policy exploration, and evaluations related to managed care models, digital health, and accessibility for Medicaid recipients, conducted by Accenture and Manatt with DSS and reviewed by CMS or other federal entities.\r\n\r\nData Collection and Stakeholder Engagement\r\nInformation regarding data collection methodologies targeting Medicaid members, providers, and stakeholders, including strategies to ensure accessibility, equity, and compliance with federal and state protections.\r\n\r\nFederal Oversight, Accountability, and Compliance\r\nDocumentation from federal agencies related to funding compliance, regulatory oversight, or audits, evaluations, or investigations assessing DSS\u2019s Medicaid program management, especially regarding the ABI Waiver and the involvement of Accenture and Manatt.\r\n\r\nDetailed Records Requested\r\nPlease provide copies of the following documents:\r\n\r\nContracts, Agreements, and Operational Frameworks\r\nConnecticut DSS: Contracts, MOUs, agreements, and scope of work documents between DSS and Accenture or Manatt.\r\nFederal Agencies (CMS, HHS, GAO, OIG): Federal approvals, reviews, or conditions placed on Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid amendments or funding, particularly involving the ABI Waiver and managed care services.\r\n\r\nCommunications and Procedural Directives\r\nConnecticut DSS: Email and written communications

forums, workshops, or review meetings with DSS regarding Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid amendments, ABI Waiver program updates, or evaluations of managed care models.\r\n\r\nAnalysis, Recommendations, and Raw Data\r\n\r\nConnecticut DSS and Federal Agencies (CMS, GAO): All data, draft versions, and final recommendations produced by Accenture and Manatt, including raw data, methodology documentation, and preliminary findings related to Medicaid program evaluations.\r\nCDC Data on ABI/TBI: Any ABI or TBI-related data provided to DSS, Accenture, or Manatt, which may impact Medicaid ABI Waiver amendments.\r\n\r\nMedicaid Provider and Consumer Access and Contact Records\r\nConnecticut DSS: Documentation on Medicaid provider registry updates, provider affiliations, approval dates,

Ensuring that DSS\u2019s activities and collaborations with consulting firms like Accenture and Manatt align with federal and state standards is of great public interest.

Prompt access to these records is essential to identify any potential misconduct and prevent ongoing misuse of taxpayer dollars, particularly within critical programs affecting vulnerable populations.\r\n\r\nTime-Sensitive Advocacy Needs: This information is critical for advocacy efforts that inform stakeholders, ensure consumer protection, and foster transparency. Any delay could impede the ability of stakeholders, including advocacy groups and affected individuals, to respond adequately to Medicaid policy changes.\r\n\r\nJustification for Fee Waiver\r\nThis information will serve the public interest by supporting oversight, transparency, and protection for Medicaid recipients, particularly Connecticut\u2019s ABI Waiver participants. The release of these records will contribute to the ethical and accountable administration of taxpayer-funded programs. Accordingly, I request a waiver of fees for processing this request.\r\n\r\nDelivery and Accessibility Requirements\r\nTo accommodate disability-related needs, please provide all records in digital format via email and avoid using external portals.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",
