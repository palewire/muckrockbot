Stop-level records\r\n1.1)  All records that document vehicle or pedestrian stops that were initiated or materially influenced by an ALPR/Flock alert within the timeframe. This includes traffic stops where the plate or vehicle was flagged by a Flock camera.\r\n1.2)  For each stop, please provide, to the extent maintained:\r\n- Incident/case number; CAD event number\r\n- Date and start/end time of stop\r\n- Stop location (block-level or coordinates), patrol district/beat\r\n- Involved unit(s) and officer ID(s)\r\n- Stated legal basis/reason for stop\r\n- Whether the ALPR/Flock hit was the sole basis or a contributing factor\r\n- ALPR hit details: plate read, state, match reason/source (e.g., stolen vehicle, BOLO, warrant, expired registration), hit confidence, associated hotlist or BOLO identifier, camera ID and camera location, Flock event ID if available\r\n- Subject outcome(s): warning/citation(s) with statute codes, search conducted (yes/no; consent/probable cause), arrest(s) with charges, tow/impound, no action\r\n- Any officer narrative or disposition text\r\n- Demographic fields collected for stop data reporting, if maintained (e.g., perceived race/ethnicity, age, gender), recognizing personal identifiers may be redacted\r\n- Use-of-force indicator if tracked at stop level\r\n1.3) If such fields do not exist, please state so.\r\n1.4) Preferred format: CSV or Excel for tabular fields; PDFs for narratives; please include a data dictionary/code sheets for field names and values.\r\n\r\n2) CAD/RMS queries and reports\r\n2.1) Any standard or ad hoc CAD/RMS reports that list stops associated with ALPR/Flock hits (e.g., nature/type codes \u201cALPR,\u201d \u201cFLOCK,\u201d \u201cLPR,\u201d or similar), for the timeframe.\r\n2.2) If a flag/field exists in CAD/RMS linking a stop to an ALPR hit, please export all records with that field populated for the timeframe.\r\n2.3) If such fields do not exist, please state so.\r\n\r\n3) Flock Safety logs tied to stops\r\n3.1) Flock \u201cHit\u201d or \u201cAlert\u201d logs for the timeframe that resulted in officer action or a stop, including: timestamp, camera ID/location, plate read, associated hotlist entry, hit confidence, responding unit/officer (if recorded), acknowledgement/dispatch notes, event ID.\r\n3.2) Any exports or audit logs that show user access or queries directly associated with the above stops.\r\n3.3) Preferred format: CSV/Excel.\r\n\r\n4) Metadata and codebooks\r\n4.1) Data dictionaries, schemas, and code sheets for relevant CAD/RMS tables/fields used to record stop reasons, dispositions, ALPR associations, and Flock event identifiers.\r\n\r\n5) If records are not tracked:\r\n5.1) If EPD does not track whether a stop was initiated or influenced by an ALPR/Flock hit, please provide:\r\n5.1.1) A written explanation of how such stops could be identified, if at all;\r\n5.1.2) The names of any fields, codes, or report names you considered; and\r\n5.1.3) The specific database systems searched (e.g., CAD, RMS, Flock portal) and the search queries used.\r\n\r\nIf the above is burdensome, please first produce:\r\n- A stop-level dataset limited to the most recent 30 days; or\r\n- A monthly aggregate count of ALPR/Flock-initiated stops and outcomes for the full timeframe.\r\n\r\nPreferred Format: \r\n- Please provide records electronically via email or secure download. \r\n- Data tables in CSV/Excel preferred\r\n- Documents in searchable PDF.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nI request a fee waiver under ORS 192.324(5) because disclosure primarily benefits the public by informing community understanding of ALPR-driven enforcement and public impact. I am requesting these records for noncommercial purposes and intend to make the results publicly available. These records will be actively shared and used by community groups throughout Eugene. If fees will exceed $50, please provide a written cost estimate and do not proceed without confirmation.\r\n\r\nIf you withhold or redact any portion, please produce all segregable nonexempt material and cite the specific statutory basis for each redaction or withholding.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me if you have questions\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSeth May",
