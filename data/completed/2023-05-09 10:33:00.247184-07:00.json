I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

This case is of great public interest as it involved the wrongful convictions of five teenagers - Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise - for the assault and rape of Trisha Meili, a female jogger, in Central Park on the night of April 19, 1989. The case garnered significant media attention and raised serious concerns about the criminal justice system, police tactics, and racial bias. The convictions were later vacated in 2002, and a settlement was reached with the City of New York in 2014.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking the following records:\r\n\r\nAll internal memos, emails, and communications related to the investigation of the Central Park Five case.\r\nAll documents and records pertaining to the investigation, arrest, and prosecution of Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise, including but not limited to police reports, witness statements, interrogation records, and forensic evidence.\r\nAll records of any internal investigations, disciplinary actions, or reviews related to the handling of the Central Park Five case, including any assessments or evaluations of the tactics employed during the investigation and interrogation process.\r\nAny documents or records that detail the settlement and/or restitution process for Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise.\r\nAll documents and records pertaining to the investigation and prosecution of Matias Reyes, whose confession and DNA evidence ultimately led to the exoneration of the Central Park Five.\r\nAny other relevant documents, records, or files that pertain to the Central Park Five case.\r\nI request that you provide these records without redaction or withholding, as the requested documents are of significant public interest and concern. If any information is withheld or redacted, please provide a written explanation for the denial, citing the specific exemption(s) under FOIL that justify the withholding or redaction. As established in numerous FOIL cases, including Matter of Gould v. New York City Police Department (89 N.Y.2d 267) and Matter of Fink v. Lefkowitz (47 N.Y.2d 567), the burden of proof for denying access to requested documents falls on the agency.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that I intend to exhaust all administrative remedies and may seek judicial review under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules if access to the requested documents is denied or if there is an unreasonable delay in providing the requested documents.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need clarification regarding this request, please   feel free to reach out  for clarfication\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

Therefore, I request that you provide access to the requested records as soon as possible and within the statutory time frame of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting that you waive any fees associated with this request, as I am a member of the public and this request is being made for a public purpose.\r\n\r\nI understand that your agency may charge a fee for the actual cost of duplication or retrieval of records, but I respectfully request that you waive any such fees in the interest of transparency and public access.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This serial consists of a long list of names of\r\nindividuals who requested information on or attended the North American\r\nPlanning Conference.\r\n\r\n100-CG-37958 Serial 260 (Subject: Headland Club): 4 total pages; 1 page\r\nreleased in full, 1 page released in redacted form to protect the\r\nidentities of confidential sources per 5 USC 552 (b)(7)(D) and 2 pages\r\nwithheld in full to protect security-classified information per 5 USC 552\r\n(b)(1).\r\n\r\nYou or your representative may view the redacted documents at the National\r\nArchives facility in College Park, Maryland. Please email\r\nspecialaccess_foia@nara.gov at least one week in advance of your visit to\r\narrange to see the records. If you cannot visit our College Park facility,\r\nyou may order reproduction copies at the cost of $0.80 per page. Please\r\nemail specialaccess_foia@nara.gov to place an order. Please include your\r\nFOIA case number *RD 61698* and a list of the documents from the case that\r\nyou would like to order.\r\n\r\nYou requested a waiver for reproduction fees ordinarily charged to\r\nresearchers. However, records transferred to the custody of the National\r\nArchives are exempt from the fee and fee waiver provisions of the Freedom\r\nof Information Act because a fee schedule was in effect prior to enactment.\r\nThe applicable section states that \u201cnothing in this subparagraph shall\r\nsupersede fees chargeable under a statute specifically providing for\r\nsetting the level of fees for particular types of records\u201d (5 U.S.C. 552\r\n(a)(4)(A)(vi)). The relevant fee statute authorizes the National Archives\r\n\u201cto charge a fee for making or authenticating copies or reproductions of\r\nmaterials transferred to the Archivist\u2019s custody.\u201d (44 U.S.C. 2116(c)). The\r\ninability to grant the requested fee waiver does not constitute a denial\r\nunder the terms of the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRegarding 157-CG-5377 Serial 1B, the subject of the file is Nation of\r\nIslam. We located serials 1B1-1B3, but they did not mention Dennis Vincent\r\nBrutus. The documents refer to lists of publications that were used as\r\nevidence in the case. This response is not considered a denial of your\r\nrequest under the terms of the FOIA because I have determined that the\r\nrecords are not pertinent to your subject of interest. However, if you\r\nbelieve that the records are responsive to your request, please contact\r\nthis office at specialaccess_foia@nara.gov within ninety (90) calendar days\r\nfrom the date of this letter. If we do not hear from you within ninety (90)\r\ncalendar days, we will administratively close this request.\r\n\r\nRegarding  100-CG-356635  Serial 1B3 and 1B1, we were unable to locate that\r\nfile number in our custody. We contacted the FBI and they confirmed the\r\ncorrect number should be 100-CG-35635. We located file 100-CG-35635, which\r\nis on the subject Nation of Islam. However, we were unable to locate any\r\ndocuments numbered 1B1 or 1B3. We did locate a Subsection B within the file\r\nand checked serials 1 and 3, but they did not mention Dennis Vincent\r\nBrutus. We do not consider this response a denial under the Freedom of\r\nInformation Act because the records in our custody do not include the\r\ninformation you requested.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request. If you have questions\r\nconcerning my review, please contact me directly at megan.dwyre@nara.gov or\r\n301-837-0488.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with my action on this request, you have the right\r\nto file an administrative appeal within ninety (90) calendar days from the\r\ndate of this letter. Appeals must be in writing and may be delivered by\r\nregular U.S. mail or by e-mail. By filing an appeal, you preserve your\r\nrights under the Freedom of Information Act and present the deciding agency\r\nwith an opportunity to review your request and reconsider its decision. If\r\nyou submit your appeal by regular mail, it should be addressed to the\r\nDeputy Archivist of the United States (ND), National Archives and Records\r\nAdministration, 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 4200, College Park, Maryland\r\n20740-6001. Both the letter and envelope should be clearly marked \u201cFOIA\r\nAppeal.\u201d If you submit your appeal by e-mail, please send it to\r\nfoia@nara.gov, addressed to the Deputy Archivist, with the words \u201cFOIA\r\nAppeal\u201d in the subject line.

All communications concerning this request\r\nshould reference FOIA tracking number* RD 61698*.\r\n\r\nIf you would like the opportunity to discuss my response and attempt to\r\nresolve your dispute without initiating the appeals process, you may\r\ncontact our FOIA Public Liaison for assistance:\r\n\r\nAccessioned Executive Branch Records \u2013 Washington, DC Area\r\nFOIA Requester Service Center: 301-837-3190 <(301)%20837-3190>\r\nActing FOIA Public Liaison: Britney Crawford\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\nTelephone: <(301)%20837-3270>301-837-3190 <(301)%20837-3190>\r\nE-mail: dc.foia.liaison@nara.gov\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to resolve your dispute through our Public Liaison, the\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS) is the federal FOIA\r\nombudsman.

The request was assigned the tracking number RD 61698. \r\n\r\nOn 4 July, NARA sent me a list of responsive records and asked if I wanted copies. I said that I did, and on 5 July NARA sent me a price quote for copying the records and said that once I had paid the fee, they would try to get me the records within 4 to 6 weeks. On 10 July, I sent NARA a check for the copying fee as instructed. Since that time, I have heard nothing from NARA about my FOIA request. I have followed up with them about it by email every month and am getting no response. \r\n\r\nI have paid good money for these records. Please let me know as soon as possible when I can expect to receive them.\r\n\r\nMost sincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Secretarial Order 3244 (November 12, 2002) anchored Bureau/Office FOIA Offices within their respective CIOs' Offices. That order was superseded by Secretarial Order 3309 (December 14, 2010), which replaced Bureau/Office CIOs with Assistant Directors for Information Resources and initiated a series of significant ongoing organizational changes as part of the Department's IT Transformation. \r\nBureau/office FOIA Officers are responsible for tracking, managing and responding to FOIA requests for records in their organization's possession and control, and administering their organization's FOIA programs. In addition to Bureau/Office FOIA Officers, some bureaus/offices also have Regional FOIA Coordinators and Field Offices that process requests. Some bureaus/offices have their program offices (i.e., the offices whose records are the subject of the requests) prepare the responses to FOIA requests. These responses are reviewed by the FOIA Officer or Regional FOIA Coordinator and the appropriate FOIA attorney (when the decision is to withhold information, make a discretionary release, or deny a fee waiver).\u201d\r\n\r\n- - - > > > all staffing reports and plans for the year 2019\r\n- If reports are available for each month, such a version is preferred.\r\n\r\n- - - > > > contact information, including email addresses and phone numbers (if available), for each FOIA officer currently tasked with an open public records request\r\n\r\n***FOIA requester categories***\r\n- - - > > > for the years 2017 and 2018, the designated category of each requester of a FOIA request to this office, including those assigned to the following categories: \r\n* commercial; \r\n* educational and noncommercial scientific institutions; \r\n* representative of news media requester; \r\n* all other requesters\r\n- If this information is kept in an aggregate form including the number of requesters by fee category by year, a copy of this report will suffice to fulfill this element of the request.\r\n\r\n***FOIA fee waivers***\r\n- - - > > > for the years 2017 and 2018, the number of fee waivers granted by this office and, if available, the tracking numbers for the FOIA requests to which waivers were granted\r\n\r\n***FOIA fee collection***\r\n- - - > > > for the years 2017 and 2018, any report capturing the following information:\r\n* total estimated processing and copy fees quoted to FOIA requesters\r\n* total processing and copy fees collected by this Bureau from each fee category\r\n- If this information is kept in an aggregate form, such as a FOIA log, that material would be sufficient to satisfy the bullet points \u201cFOIA requester categories\u201d and \u201cFOIA fee collection\u201d if it captures the following information:\r\n* FOIA tracking number\r\n* requester fee category\r\n* amount processing and copy fees associated with the request\r\n* the status of the requester\u2019s payment for the request\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBeryl Lipton\n\n",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Mitchel Levitas.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Also, if please provide any information on how those bids were scored, who was on the committee that chose the contract and the actual scores given each bid. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to the portion of this request seeking \u201cRFPs\u201d are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) FOIA Office has been advised that the Board of Education has not finalized the contract for the scope of work referenced in this request at this time. Although the Board approved that the CPS can enter info drafting and negotiating a contract this can take some time as both sets of attorneys must draft and approve all areas of the contract and then the contract must be signed. Accordingly, the remainder of records sought in this request become public once all parties have finalized and signed an agreement and are therefore currently exempt from disclosure at this time pursuant to sections 7(1)(h) and 7(1)(f) of the FOIA. Section 7 (1)(h) exempts form release \u201c[p]roposals and bids for any contract, grant, or agreement, including information which if it were disclosed would frustrate procurement or give an advantage to any person proposing to enter into a contractor agreement.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(h). Section 7(1)(f) exempts from release any \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(f). Accordingly, you may wish to resubmit this request at a later date. In the case of a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706. You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. \u00a0Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

If there is anything else I can assist with please let me know.\r\n\r\nYour request was as follows:\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\nPursuant to the Alabama Public Records, I hereby request the following records:\r\nAll adverse actions taken against teacher licenses or certificates as reported to the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification (NASDTEC), including but not limited to public reprimands, denials, invalidations, annulments, revocations, suspensions, and voluntary surrenders, with the nature and description of the reason for action (i.e., sexual misconduct, breach of contract, incompetence, etc.) noted alongside the full names of every teacher, from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2022.\r\nI would like these records in the electronic format that they are stored in, transmitted via email or other digital method; please refrain from sending paper copies of the records.\r\nRather than provide all responsive records at once, I ask that you provide copies of records on a rolling basis, as they become available.\r\nIf you determine that any of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, I ask you to note whether the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\nPlease waive any applicable fees; this information is being sought for reporting purposes.\r\nNote: A delay in access to these records is tantamount to a denial of access.\r\nThank you for your timely attention to this matter.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\nSincerely,\r\nAndr\u00e9 Natta, a citizen of Alabama, in coordination with Insider Staff.\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Falabama-state-department-of-education-18308%252Fjanuary-30-business-insider-public-records-request-139744%252F%253Femail%253Dcomm%252540alsde.edu&url_auth_token=AABhH18FZY9QY6tkf-xoZXwnl6k%3A1pMNN6%3AUJzZoT53ka_v9quJcEpD62j10nRcshl2M3_1xo7CW_o\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nYWREAGKR\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 139744-93305949@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:139744-93305949@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 139744\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMichael O.

        "communication": "Dear Records Requestor:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mead School District received your public records request on November\r\n9, 2021. This serves as the District\u2019s response within five (5) business\r\ndays, as required by law.  You have requested:\r\n\r\n\r\n*\"I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests\r\nreceived by Mead School District and a complete electronic copy of the\r\nDistrict's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period\r\nJanuary 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\nYour records request seems clear in one respect, as to the records you wish\r\nto have copied and provided to you by the initial segment of your request.\r\nBut, the second segment of your request is not clear to us.  So, we are in\r\nneed of clarification from you as to that segment.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is clear by the first segment of your request that you wish to\r\nreceive a copy of every public records request that has been submitted to\r\nour School District, going back historically for more than a decade, to\r\nJanuary 1, 2010.\r\n\r\nIt will be a daunting and time-consuming task to locate all of those\r\nrecords for duplication and production to you.  Some of those requests\r\nwould have been received by us in electronic format only, e.g., such as via\r\nemail.  Those would not have been forwarded to any central electronic file\r\nlocation, nor printed to a paper copy and placed in any particular physical\r\nfile location.  As well, requests of that sort would not necessarily have\r\nbeen received by the person designated as our public records officer at the\r\ntime the request was received.  Rather, any given request could conceivably\r\nbeen received by any other given employee in our District.\r\n\r\nFor additional reasons, designing a search methodology calculated to locate\r\nall such emailed requests would be very difficult, if not impossible.  That\r\nis because we cannot be required to read every single email received by\r\nevery employee in our School District over the last ten-plus years, to\r\nlocate for you those had content qualifying them as public records\r\nrequest.  That likely means the next alternative search methodology would\r\nbe to employ electronic \u201ckeyword\u201d searches, of our \u201cinbound\u201d email\r\ndatabases over the last ten years.  But those sorts of searches could well\r\nbe unreliable, to in-fact yield all such requests, as it would be the case\r\nthat some, if not many, records requestors did not cite our public\r\ndisclosure law in making their requests, nor even use any particular words\r\nor phrasing \u2013 such as \u201cpublic record\u201d \u2013 when submitting their requests.  In\r\nfact, our state\u2019s public disclosure law provides that in order for a public\r\nagency like our District to be compelled to process a records request under\r\nthat statute, the records requestor need only not submit it to a particular\r\nemployee of ours, but s/he need not provide a citation to that public\r\ndisclosure law nor reference it by name or in any other manner, nor use any\r\nparticular language in submitting the request.\r\n\r\nSo, to create a list of \u201ckeyword\u201d search terms that would likely yield\r\nevery single records request that our District has received, via email over\r\nthe last ten-plus years, could indeed be a practical impossibility.\r\nHowever, when faced with such a situation, our public disclosure laws\r\nsuggest we dialogue with a requestor in your position, toward a cooperative\r\ncollaboration aimed at generating a mutually agreed-upon list of keyword\r\nsearch terms that can be used to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nSo, toward that end, I\u2019d like to initiate that dialogue.  Would you please\r\ngive me a call, to discuss that point?\r\n\r\nAside from those difficulties with locating all electronic public records\r\nrequests we\u2019ve received over the last ten-plus years, we of course have\r\nreceived such requests in the form of physical (i.e., paper).  These\r\nlargely would exist only in files contained in boxes in our School\r\nDistrict\u2019s archives.  To search those files will take an immense amount of\r\nstaff time.\r\n\r\nIn any case, because of the number and variety of locations of records\r\nrequests in need of being located, copied, and produced to you in response\r\nto the first segment of your request, we plan to fulfill it in a series of\r\npartial-batch-installments.   We are now estimating that you should expect\r\nto receive the first installment within 90 days of this email\r\n(approximately February 14, 2021).\r\n\r\nAlso, before we provide you that first installment, we likely will need an\r\nadvance pre-payment from you of the cost-of-production charges that are\r\nallowable under our state\u2019s public disclosure law.  I will advise you if\r\nthat will be necessary, and of the required amount, within that same 90-day\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nSecond, as I said above, we are uncertain of the scope of records you wish\r\nus to locate for you, by your language stating you wish to receive: \u201ca\r\ncomplete electronic copy of the District\u2019s Responses\u201d to each of the public\r\nrecords requests we\u2019ll be providing you.   By \u201cResponses,\u201d that could be\r\nfairly interpreted in many different ways, as to the scope of records you\r\ndo or do not wish to receive.  For instance, it could mean you wish only to\r\nreceive copies of the actual; records that School District gathered,\r\ncopied, and provided to each given requestor, in \u201cResponse\u201d to his or her\r\nrequest (i.e., because those records had content falling within the\r\ndescriptive scope of the request).  On the other hand, we frequently\r\n\u201cRespond\u201d to requestors by directing letters or email communications to\r\nthem that contain no actual \u201cResponsive\u201d records, but instead communicate\r\nwith the requestor about any number of points of information or inquiry\r\nthat arise in the course of processing records requests (in fact, this\r\nemail is a precise example of that sort of \u201cResponse\u201d.)\r\n\r\nSo, we\u2019re in need of receiving clarification from you, by way of a\r\nreasonably specific description, as to the scope of records that you do\r\nwish to receive by that second segment of your request.\r\n\r\nPer the above, I will now look forward to the dialogue I\u2019ve initiated with\r\nyou concerning collaboratively working together toward a mutually-agreeable\r\nlist of \u201ckeyword\u201d searches that we can utilize to locate the emailed public\r\nrecords requests you\u2019ve requested, and also to receiving the clarification\r\nI also requested above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJill\r\n*Jill Therrien*\r\n*HR Leaves Specialist *\r\n*Mead School District*\r\n*2323 E Farwell Rd.*\r\n*Mead, WA 99021*\r\n*(509) 465-6049 (p)*\r\n*(509) 465-7680 (f)*\r\n\r\nThe information in this email is confidential, privileged, and/or otherwise\r\nprotected from disclosure.

        "communication": "Dear Requestor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your inquiry about the initial response you received from me\r\nto your records request to our School District, and the one you received\r\nfrom the counterpart representative of mine at the Evergreen School\r\nDistrict.  While we are extremely busy with other matters and our School\r\nDistrict has no obligation to dedicate the time or effort necessary to\r\nanswer your inquiry, we\u2019re more than happy to do so on this occasion.\r\nThat\u2019s because it is essential, for successful fulfillment of your request,\r\nto foster the sort of mutually collaborative dialogue with you that I\r\noffered and requested of you in the very same initial response email about\r\nwhich you are inquiring.  In fact, that sort of affirmative collaborative\r\ncommunication is exactly what the regulations under the Washington Public\r\nRecords Act (\u201cPRA\u201d) call for, reciprocally from a requestor such as\r\nyourself and our District, when questions exist \u2013 as they do here, with\r\nyour request \u2013 about just what particular records do and do not need to be\r\nlocated for production, and when \u2013 also as here \u2013 difficulties are\r\npresented by the request as to how to best go about searching to locate all\r\nresponsive records that happen to exist in electronic form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, please accept the following explanation as to why you received like\r\ninitial responses from our School District and the Evergreen School\r\nDistrict and why the same may well be occurring by this email in response\r\nto the inquiry you\u2019ve now made \u2013 and why that, of course, was and is not at\r\nall a matter of coincidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not infrequent that our School District receives a PRA records\r\nrequest that, by its unique nature, volume, and/or ambiguity, prompts us to\r\ndouble-check on the steps we ought to take to make sure we entirely fulfill\r\nall of the obligations we owe the requestor under the PRA.  And in the\r\ncourse of that, it is not at all uncommon that we find it appropriate to\r\nconsult for assistance/advice with PRA resources outside of our office, for\r\nadditional expertise that might supplement our District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d\r\nPRA-processing experience and abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to requests like yours, we and many other school districts\r\nbelieve that outside consultation is in fact a \u201cbest practice.\u201d  Doing so\r\nnot only operates to the benefit of the school district that is in need of\r\nprocessing the request, but just as much to the benefit of the records\r\nrequestor.  In short, that sort of outside-resource consultation enhances\r\nassurances that the requestor will indeed receive an appropriately-timely\r\nand -thorough production of a copy of every reasonably-locatable,\r\nnon-exempt public record that s/he/it seeks, as the end-product of the\r\ndistrict\u2019s execution of search and production steps that were, from the\r\nvery outset, very concertedly designed to assure that the requestor indeed\r\nreceives full performance of all obligations owed her/him/it under public\r\ndisclosure requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I said, many other school districts in our state engage in that same\r\nbest practice, by seeking supplemental PRA assistance from resources\r\noutside their own records-processing staff, to assure they properly process\r\nand fulfill a request like yours.  And sometimes, some of them by\r\nhappenstance coincidentally consult with to the same, common outside\r\nresource for that assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, when two or more school districts have received the same, identical\r\nrequest, and they happen to have consulted with the same external PRA\r\nresource to help assure they give a proper initial response to the request,\r\nit is not a surprise if they happen to \u201cland on the same spot\u201d in\r\ncommunicating their initial responses to the same request/requestor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what happened here.  Since the verbiage, substance, and detail of\r\nyour requests to both our School District and the Evergreen School District\r\nwere and are precisely identical, we and that District were prompted by a\r\nneed to address with you the exact same records-collection, technology,\r\ntime frame, dialogue/clarification, etc., issues with you, via our\r\nrespective initial responses; and by happenstance, we consulted with the\r\nsame outside source for assistance with our respective initial responses,\r\ntoward the aim of best fulfilling your request to your ultimate\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor that same reason, as I stated above, it would not be surprising and\r\nindeed quite that you may well receive this same explanation, virtually\r\nidentically, to the exact same inquiry you\u2019ve now directed to both of our\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, having provided the foregoing, we want to acknowledge and assure you\r\nthat we in no way plan to provide you any sort of a \u201ccookie cutter\u201d\r\napproach to the continuing processing and fulfillment of your request.\r\nThat could not properly occur under the obligations we owe you under the\r\nPRA.  We fully understand that when a records request we\u2019ve received has\r\nalso been identically submitted to another (or more than one other) school\r\ndistrict, at some point \u2013 usually fairly early on \u2013 that request must and\r\nwill be handled differently and uniquely by us, as compared to the\r\ndifferent sort of handling that (or those) other district(s) must and will\r\nneed to dedicate to their proper processing of that same request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s so for virtually innumerable reasons.  Some of those, just by way of\r\nexamples, would be that we are most certainly differently-situated as\r\ncompared to the Evergreen School District to the particular internal\r\nprocesses we have adopted for processing records requests, once we are\r\nassured we know the specific parameters of the scope of records implicated\r\nby the request; we doubtless have differing particularities in the\r\nprotocols we have followed in our paper and electronic records-filing and\r\n-archiving systems, relative to how and where records responsive to the\r\nrequest in likely to be located in our District; comparatively greater or\r\nlesser staffing levels will exist, as between that District and ours, in\r\nterms of the volume and \u201cquality\u201d of human resources we and they have to\r\ndedicate to the processing of your request, particularly in terms of\r\nexperience or expertise levels amongst records-processing staff members as\r\nto unique issues raised by the request; differences in availability of that\r\nstaff to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other\r\nhigh-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our\r\nrespective Districts\u2019 abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and\r\nprotecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us; the numbers of\r\nemployees outside of our records-processing staffs (e.g.,\r\nadministrators/teachers/others employed in our schools who will need to\r\ndedicate time to assisting in the records-gathering process for the\r\nrequest, and their ability to perform that work while still performing\r\ntheir duties; different levels of experience, technologies, and staff\r\navailability in our respective IT departments who likely will need to work\r\non the request; etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the reasons I\u2019ve stated, the appropriate \u201csameness\u201d of our School\r\nDistrict\u2019s processing of your request, as between ourselves and the\r\nEvergreen School District (or for that matter, as compared to any other\r\nschool district that has received your request) likely will end very\r\nshortly \u2013 indeed we\u2019d expect, upon the occurrence of the requested,\r\ncollaborative dialogue with you on the points that were identified in my\r\ninitial response to you.  So I do look very much look forward to hearing\r\nfrom you so that we can address those points, and we can proceed with the\r\nbenefit of that planned, good discussion in the best possible posture\r\ntoward fulfilling your request in a timely and thorough manner that best\r\nmeets your records and informational needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJill\r\n*Jill Therrien*\r\n*HR Leaves Specialist *\r\n*Mead School District*\r\n*2323 E Farwell Rd.*\r\n*Mead, WA 99021*\r\n*(509) 465-6049 (p)*\r\n*(509) 465-7680 (f)*\r\n\r\nThe information in this email is confidential, privileged, and/or otherwise\r\nprotected from disclosure.

        "communication": "Hello Ms. Therrien,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response.\r\n\r\nI disagree with many of your statements in regards to the District\u2019s legal obligations for compliance with the Washington State Public Records Act. Further, I do not believe your explanation regarding the \u201csameness\u201d of the obviously plagiarized EVERGREEN 11-16-21 email to be offed in good faith. \r\n\r\nPlease note RCW 42.56.030:\r\n\r\n\u2018The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may maintain control over the instruments that they have created. This chapter shall be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed to promote this public policy and to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other act, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.\u2019\r\n\r\nRegardless, the following are responses to your request for \u201cclarification\u201d dated 11-16-2021:\r\n\r\n1. Please address any questions you may have regarding this public records request (PRR) in writing via email.\r\n\r\n2. You stated the District was \u201cuncertain\u201d as to the scope of records requested and you then requested a \u201creasonably specific description\u201d as to the scope of records requested.\r\n\r\nI begin my response below by incorporating the text of the original public records request dated 11-4-2021:\r\n\r\n\u201cI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Mead School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo further clarify this request: \r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all original PRA requests. If the original PRA request was made via email, I request the NATIVE electronic format to be produced. If the original request was made via US mail or limited to written paper form only, I request an electronic .pdf copy of the original request.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all communications between the District and the PRA requestor regarding the processing and any other aspect of production for the PRR. All communications, requests for clarification and replies are responses by the District and were previously requested in my original request. If the communications between the District and the requestor were via email I request the NATIVE electronic email format to be produced. If the communications between the District and the original requestor were limited to written paper form I request a .pdf copy of any communications.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all \u201crecords and writings\u201d as defined by RCW 42.56 previously produced by the District in response to the original PRA request. If the District produced electronic files in response to a PRA request, I request a duplicate copy of the files produced. If the District produced paper copies in response to a PRA request, I request a .pdf copy of those paper copies to be produced. \r\n\r\n3. As for keyword searches and the District\u2019s expressed difficulty in locating electronic and paper public records requests over the years, unfortunately I cannot offer guidance other than to suggest the District immediately seek and retain additional expertise that might supplement District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d PRA-processing experience and abilities. This PRR is not for keywords but rather for public records previously produced by the District.\r\n\r\nPlease reference WAC 44-14-04003 (10) Searching for records.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn agency must conduct an objectively reasonable search for responsive records. The adequacy of a search is judged by the standard of reasonableness. A requestor is not required to \"ferret out\" records on his or her own. A reasonable agency search usually begins with the public records officer for the agency or a records coordinator for a department of the agency deciding where the records are likely to be and who is likely to know where they are. One of the most important parts of an adequate search is to decide how wide the search will be. If the agency is small, it might be appropriate to initially ask all agency employees and officials if they have responsive records. If the agency is larger, the agency may choose to initially ask only the staff of the department or departments of an agency most likely to have the records. For example, a request for records showing or discussing payments on a public works project might initially be directed to all staff in the finance and public works departments if those departments are deemed most likely to have the responsive documents, even though other departments may have copies or alternative versions of the same documents. Meanwhile, other departments that may have documents should be instructed to preserve their records in case they are later deemed to be necessary to respond to the request. The agency could notify the requestor which departments are being surveyed for the documents so the requestor may suggest other departments.\r\n\r\nIf agency employees or officials are using home computers, personal devices, or personal accounts to conduct agency business, those devices and accounts also need to be searched by the employees or officials who are using them when those devices and accounts may have responsive records. If an agency's contractors performing agency work have responsive public records of an agency as a consequence of the agency's contract, they should also be notified of the records request. It is better to be over inclusive rather than under inclusive when deciding which staff or others should be contacted, but not everyone in an agency needs to be asked if there is no reason to believe he or she has responsive records. An email to staff or agency officials selected as most likely to have responsive records is usually sufficient. Such an email also allows an agency to document whom it asked for records. Documentation of searches is recommended. The courts can consider the reasonableness of an agency's search when considering assessing penalties for an agency's failure to produce records.\u201d\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

        "communication": "Dear Records Requestor:\r\n\r\nAs previously acknowledged the Mead School District received your public\r\nrecords request on November 9, 2021. You have requested:\r\n\r\n\r\n*\"I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests\r\nreceived by Mead School District and a complete electronic copy of the\r\nDistrict's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period\r\nJanuary 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached please find a 1st installment to your request. We would like to\r\nnote a couple of items with this first installment. First, it is smaller\r\nthan we had anticipated being able to provide, as we ran into significant\r\ntechnical issues with collecting the records in the Native format as you\r\nrequested. Secondly, we did have to make some additional redactions to one\r\nof the requests we are providing, as the requestor has changed and certain\r\nFERPA exemptions now apply to the records. In order for us to be able to\r\nmake the applicable redactions we have had to provide those records in PDF\r\nform (with the metadata included). We have also provided a withholding log\r\nthat reflects those redactions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, pursuant to RCW 42.56.520, I am hereby notifying you that the\r\nMead School District estimates we will be able to respond more fully to\r\nyour request on or before March 30, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised of the District's recently updated Policy on providing\r\nrecords, waiver of costs, and agreements regarding costs. The District will\r\ntake reasonable steps to provide the records in the most efficient manner\r\navailable to the District in its normal operations, which will typically be\r\nin electronic format. The following is the District's fee structure for\r\nelectronic records:\r\n\r\n1.  Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format\r\nor for the use of  District equipment to scan the records.\r\n\r\n2.  Five cents per each four electronic files or attachments uploaded to\r\nemail, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\n3.  Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an\r\nelectronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records\r\nelectronically.\r\n\r\n4.  The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the\r\nDistrict, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the\r\ncopies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe charge for the included installment is so de minimis that it has been\r\nwaived at this time. The possible charge for the remaining records,\r\nhowever, likely will not be so de minimis that we could waive charges. So,\r\nplease be prepared that we likely will be asking that you pre-pay before\r\nwe'll be able to provide you with future installments.\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Officer or designee may require a deposit of up to ten\r\npercent of the estimated costs of copying all the records selected by the\r\nrequestor, including the cost of a customized service charge according to\r\nthe provision. If the requestor fails to pay a deposit or final payment for\r\nthe requested copies, the Public Records Officer will close the request and\r\nindicate to the requestor that the District has closed the request.\r\n\r\nIf requested, the District will provide a summary of the applicable charges\r\nbefore charges are imposed under this procedure. The requestor will be\r\nallowed to revise the request in order to reduce the applicable charges.\r\n\r\nThe following links provide more detailed information regarding the\r\nDistrict's Public Records Policy\r\n<https://www.mead354.org/ourpages/Board-Policies//Series%204000%20-%20Community%20Relations/4040_Policy_-_Public_Access_to_District_Records.pdf>\r\n and Procedure\r\n<https://www.mead354.org/ourpages/Board-Policies//Series%204000%20-%20Community%20Relations/4040_Procedure_-_Public_Access_to_District_Records.pdf>\r\n.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJill\r\n*Jill Therrien*\r\n*HR Leaves Specialist *\r\n*Mead School District*\r\n*2323 E Farwell Rd.*\r\n*Mead, WA 99021*\r\n*(509) 465-6049 (p)*\r\n*(509) 465-7680 (f)*\r\n\r\nThe information in this email is confidential, privileged, and/or otherwise\r\nprotected from disclosure.

Actually no. At least not until your agency publicly follows the law.\r\n\r\nIn fact, your agency may only charge actual costs incurred for producing public records, and then only after adopting a statement of costs including the factors and manner used to determine the actual costs, and following all that only after providing public notice and public hearing.\r\n\r\n\"RCW 42.56.070 Documents and indexes to be made public\u2014Statement of costs.(7) \r\n\r\nEach agency may establish, maintain, and make available for public inspection and copying a statement of the actual costs that it charges for providing photocopies or electronically produced copies, of public records and a statement of the factors and manner used to determine the actual costs. Any statement of costs may be adopted by an agency only after providing notice and public hearing.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, any statement of costs and/or any fee schedule adopted by your agency must of course be publicly published. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(a).\r\n\r\nYour agency had no published fee schedule in place at the time of this public records request in November 2021.\r\n\r\nOf course, your agency may not be required to calculate the actual costs it charges for providing public records if your agency has published rules or regulations declaring the reasons for doing so would be unduly burdensome. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(b).\r\n\r\nHowever your agency public policy in place during November 2021 did not declare that calculating actual costs  would be unduly burdensome. Your new agency policy dated January 24, 2022 also does not declare the reason for not calculating actual costs for public records fees.\r\n\r\nPut simply, your agency cannot adopt a fee schedule of any kind without calculating actual costs. You can't make it up as you go along. \r\n\r\nI would suggest your agency waive fees for all public records requests (including this one) until such time as you can do so legally.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a copy of all fee schedules and statements of costs for public records fees your agency had in place in November of 2021.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

Each year the District must assign an appraised value to each of these accounts.  In addition, there are many different types of properties, and they are not necessarily appraised in the same manner.  Therefore, a request for records and correspondence related to the yearly appraisal is very broad.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you could clarify or narrow this request, it would assist the District in responding and reduce the time necessary to fulfill the request, as well as the charges that may be made under the Public Information Act.  For example, you could narrow or clarify this request by being more specific about the types of records you request.  Alternatively, you could narrow the request to a certain type of property, such as single-family homes or hotels.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFurther, some of the information you are requesting is confidential as a matter of law. Unless you remove confidential information from your request, we will need to request a decision of the Attorney General about the withholding of this information, further delaying a response. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease consider this a request to clarify or narrow your request.  Pursuant to Section 552.222(d) of the Texas Government Code, your request will be considered automatically withdrawn if we do not receive a written response from you within sixty-one (61) days from the date of this email.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMonica Buescher\r\n\r\nPublic Information Coordinator\r\n\r\nCommunication/Procedures Administrator \r\n\r\nLubbock Central Appraisal District\r\n\r\n <mailto:piarequest@lubbockcad.org> piarequest@lubbockcad.org\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSec. 552.222.  PERMISSIBLE INQUIRY BY GOVERNMENTAL BODY TO REQUESTOR.  (a)  The officer for public information and the officer's agent may not make an inquiry of a requestor except to establish proper identification or except as provided by Subsection (b), (c), or (c-1).\r\n\r\n(b)  If what information is requested is unclear to the governmental body, the governmental body may ask the requestor to clarify the request.  If a large amount of information has been requested, the governmental body may discuss with the requestor how the scope of a request might be narrowed, but the governmental body may not inquire into the purpose for which information will be used.\r\n\r\n(c)  If the information requested relates to a motor vehicle record, the officer for public information or the officer's agent may require the requestor to provide additional identifying information sufficient for the officer or the officer's agent to determine whether the requestor is eligible to receive the information under Chapter 730 <https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=730> , Transportation Code.  In this subsection, \"motor vehicle record\" has the meaning assigned that term by Section  <https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=730.003> 730.003, Transportation Code.\r\n\r\n(c-1)  If the information requested includes a photograph described by Section 552.155 <https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.155> (a), the officer for public information or the officer's agent may require the requestor to provide additional information sufficient for the officer or the officer's agent to determine whether the requestor is eligible to receive the information under Section 552.155 <https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.155> (b).\r\n\r\n(d)  If by the 61st day after the date a governmental body sends a written request for clarification or discussion under Subsection (b) or an officer for public information or agent sends a  written request for additional information under Subsection (c) the governmental body, officer for public information, or agent, as applicable, does not receive a written response from the requestor, the underlying request for public information is considered to have been withdrawn by the requestor.\r\n\r\n(e)  A written request for clarification or discussion under Subsection (b) or a written request for additional information under Subsection (c) must include a statement as to the consequences of the failure by the requestor to timely respond to the request for clarification, discussion, or additional information.\r\n\r\n(f)  Except as provided by Subsection (g), if the requestor's request for public information included the requestor's physical or mailing address, the request may not be considered to have been withdrawn under Subsection (d) unless the governmental body, officer for public information, or agent, as applicable, sends the request for clarification or discussion under Subsection (b) or the written request for additional information under Subsection (c) to that address by certified mail.\r\n\r\n(g)  If the requestor's request for public information was sent by electronic mail, the request may be considered to have been withdrawn under Subsection (d) if:\r\n\r\n     (1)  the governmental body, officer for public information, or agent, as applicable, sends the request for clarification or discussion under Subsection (b) or the written request for additional information under Subsection (c) by electronic mail to the same electronic mail address from which the original request was sent or to another electronic mail address provided by the requestor; and\r\n\r\n     (2)  the governmental body, officer for public information, or agent, as applicable, does not receive from the requestor a written response or response by electronic mail within the period described by Subsection (d).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdded by Acts 1993, 73rd Leg., ch. 268, Sec. 1, eff.
