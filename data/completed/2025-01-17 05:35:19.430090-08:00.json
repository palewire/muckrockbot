I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJames Earl Ray (March 10, 1928 \u2013 April 23, 1998) was an American convicted of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Ray was convicted on his 41st birthday after entering a guilty plea to forgo a jury trial. Had he been found guilty by jury trial, he would have been eligible for the death penalty. He was sentenced to 99 years in prison. He later recanted his confession and tried unsuccessfully to gain access to a retrial. In 1998, Ray died in prison of complications due to chronic hepatitis C infection. His death has been widely reported. http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/24/us/james-earl-ray-70-killer-of-dr-king-dies-in-nashville.html?pagewanted=all\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

        "communication": "Ms. North\u2014\r\n\r\nThis is in response to your September 5, 2024, request for documents under the Georgia Open Records Act, and is in accordance with the three-day period of response pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 50-18-71(b)(2).\r\n\r\nYou have requested \u201cAgreements related to the beverage pouring, distribution, sales or marketing rights for campus, athletics venues or facilities.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith respect to the portion of your request that deals with the institution, the Georgia Open Records Act allows charges for search, retrieval, review, redaction, and production in connection with compliance; provided, however, that no charge is made for the first quarter-hour. Our search, retrieval, review, redaction, and production charges in complying with this request will be three (3) hours for a total estimate of $137.50 and will require 15 business days for production. The Act also allows for an agency to defer search and retrieval of records until the requester agrees to pay the estimated costs. We ask that you provide confirmation, in writing, to us that you agree to pay these estimated charges.\r\n\r\nBecause a portion of your request is for records of the University\u2019s intercollegiate sports program, I have forwarded it to the University\u2019s Athletic Department for an assessment of the scope of potentially responsive documents, estimation of the costs to search for and produce responsive records, and consideration of potentially applicable exemptions. A written response to this portion of your request will arrive within the time-period specified in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 50-18-71(d.1).\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed with the institution portion of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nUGA Open Records\r\nDivision of Marketing & Communications\r\nHodgson Oil Building, Suite 200 N | 286 Oconee St. | Athens, GA 30602\r\n706-542-8090 | www.uga.edu<http://www.uga.edu/>\r\n[University of Georgia]\r\n[Facebook]<https://www.facebook.com/uga.edu> [Twitter] <https://twitter.com/universityofga>  [Instagram] <https://www.instagram.com/universityofga/>  [Linkedin] <https://www.linkedin.com/edu/school?id=18190>  [Youtube] <https://www.youtube.com/uga>  [Snapchat] <https://www.snapchat.com/add/university-ga>\n",

Once records were located, it was necessary to review the records for any applicable redactions or withholdings.

        "communication": "Dear U.S. Mint:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. I am requesting records related to the U.S. Mint's mascot, Layla the Mighty Minter.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\n(A) All records related to the conception of and process of designing the Layla mascot (emails and other correspondence, memoranda, contracts, sketches, etc.)\r\n\r\n(B) Records sufficient to answer the following questions:\r\n\r\n(1) Whose idea was it to create an U.S. Mint mascot in the first place, and why?\r\n\r\n(2) Who designed the Layla mascot, and what was the design process like? (e.g. were there multiple design concepts submitted? Was the design of the character contracted out? (If so, kindly produce the contract).\r\n\r\n(3) Were any Layla-related promotional items or tchotchkes created (e.g. trading cards, CDs, coloring books)? If so, please produce them.\r\n\r\n(4) Were there any life-size Layla costumes created? If so, please produce records related to the design of the costume (contracts, sketches, etc.) and any guidelines regarding the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n(5) Did anyone in Congress ever object to the U.S. Mint's use of a mascot? I understand that there have been periodic attempts by lawmakers (e.g. former Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn, current Iowa senator Jodi Ernst) to rein in agency spending on mascots. If so, please produce all records related to that.\r\n\r\n(6) What has the public's reaction been to the Layla mascot?\r\n\r\n(7) Is the Mint still using Layla as part of its public outreach? If not, why not?\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

I appeal your search and claim of no records, and your violation of my form and format request.\r\n\r\nAs for form and format, you stated that you were providing one email, and sent it as a PDF. You did not claim any exemptions.\r\n\r\nBy exporting it to PDF, you disregarded my electronic form & format requests \u2014 and you additionally rasterized the record, which I specifically asked you not to do. OCR does not cure the destruction of the original structural metadata that makes it accessible, nor make available the parts of the records (such as hyperlinks, headers, etc) which were destroyed by rasterization. I did not consent to you making new, worse records in this way.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email in one of the native electronic email formats listed; any email software will save to them easily.\r\n\r\nMy form and format request is mandatory under 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) & (f)(2)(A) (E-FOIA & FOIA Improvement Act) and 29 USC 794d (Rehab Act \u00a7 508).\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for your search and claim of no records, I believe you likely searched the \"FOIA inbox\" account foia@sss.gov. My request was about the chief FOIA officer's emails, i.e. the primary official @sss.gov email used by Craig T. Brown, \"regardless of subject matter\" \u2014 not about FOIA request emails, e.g. not about emails to or from foia@sss.gov. I therefore believe you did not search or provide the records identified, and appeal items 1-3 on that basis.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai",

        "communication": "Dear Brett Carollo: This e-mail responds to your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) request dated March 7, 2024, received by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), FOIA/PA Unit, seeking access to DEA records.\u00a0 Your request has been opened and assigned the following case number: 24-00589-F.\u00a0 Please include this case number when communicating with this office. The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests take longer than a month to complete.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public.\u00a0 You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

These sightings, widely described as \u201cmystery drones\u201d or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), have been the subject of significant public interest and media coverage.\r\n\r\nThis request specifically seeks access to all records created, received, or modified between November 1, 2024, and the date of this request's fulfillment. To ensure the identification of all responsive materials, this request includes references to \"mystery drones,\" \"UAP,\" \"unidentified flying objects (UFOs),\" \"unmanned aerial systems (UAS),\" \"unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\" \"aerial anomalies,\" or any similar terminology used to describe these aerial sightings.\r\n\r\nThe requested records include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nAudio and Video Files: All audio or video files received, recorded, or obtained by the department related to these sightings. This includes recordings made by departmental surveillance equipment, body-worn cameras, dashboard cameras, or agency-operated drones, as well as media submitted by citizens, contractors, or third parties. I request the original or highest-resolution versions of these files and associated metadata, including timestamps, geolocation data, technical specifications of recording devices, and any embedded identifiers for classification, dissemination tracking, or chain of custody.\r\n\r\nAssociated Analyses and Documentation: All investigative reports, intelligence summaries, or briefings prepared in connection with these sightings. This includes assessments of their origin, behavior, or potential significance, such as whether they posed a security, safety, or privacy threat. I also request documentation of decisions or deliberations regarding the classification, distribution, or public disclosure of information related to these events.\r\n\r\nCommunications and Directives: All internal and inter-agency communications referencing these aerial phenomena, including any correspondence that references \"mystery drones,\" UAP, or similar terms. This includes records of communications with external entities, such as contractors, private organizations, foreign governments or international bodies, and federal, state, or local agencies involved in investigating or responding to these incidents.\r\n\r\nRecords of Federal Collaboration: All records documenting referrals, consultations, or information sharing with federal agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Defense (DoD), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or any other relevant entities.\r\n\r\nIf the scope of this request is deemed overly broad, I am willing to work with your office to refine it to ensure the timely identification and release of responsive records. I also request that responsive records be provided in their original electronic format, preserving all metadata.\r\n\r\nIf any portions of the requested records are exempt under public records laws, I request that non-exempt portions be released. For any classified materials, I request a mandatory declassification review under applicable laws, including Executive Order 13526.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBill Gagnon",

McElwee: \n\nThis is a final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for entry-exit and/or I-94 records. \n\nCBP is granting your request under the FOIA, Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, CBP has determined that they are approved for release in their entirety, no deletions or exemptions have been applied. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nYou may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150.

The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2023-076128 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

Since tracking down these records includes many offices around post, this is what constitutes the time of the FOIA assistant. The time for the procurement staff constitutes their estimate for searching for identifying contracts related to \"training, workshops, presentations, instruction\" and to search for communication and coordination of said contracts. The FOIA officer reviews all records prior to their release to the public.\r\n\r\nPer your instruction, your request will be revised to include records related to Raven Solomon Enterprises LLC, Rainbow Bridge, NewPoint Strategies, and Modern Military Association between May 1, 2024, and January 5, 2025. A new estimate will be provided if the subject matter experts determine the request will cost more than $50.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at Virginia Military Institute.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

Please log into your online account to retrieve the records. \r\n\r\nWhile the responsive records were disclosed, the Department has redacted information for privacy reasons. Where non-disclosable portions of public records are \u201creasonably segregable\u201d from the disclosable portions, the agency may withhold or redact the non-disclosable portions while producing the disclosable portions. Thus, redactions are permitted under the CPRA, as long as the basis for the redaction (specified exemption) is identified in the agency\u2019s response. See Cal. Gov. Code \u00a7 7922.525(a)-(b) American Civ. Liberties Union Found\u2019n v. Deukmejian (1982) 32 Cal.3d 440, 452-454. \r\n\r\nThe Department has asserted the following exemptions as legal authority to redact portions of our disclosed records: \r\n\r\nGovernment Code \u00a7 7922.000 - the records in question are exempt because, under the facts of this particular case, the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record. \r\n\r\nGovernment Code \u00a7 7927.705, read in conjunction with Article 1, \u00a7 1 of the California Constitution provides that personal information details are subject to privacy rights that make such information exempt from disclosure. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this CPRA request closed. \r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCorr.

The FPS 2 develops models to identify fraud waste and abuse and monitor the models to validate effective alerting.\r\n\r\nI am seeking:\r\n\r\n1) Contracts, memorandums of understanding, and statements of work between the department and any outside party regarding the implementation and development of FPS2 of any service to detect or predict fraud\r\n\r\n2) Documentation of FPS 2 or predictive models that the agency currently uses (including those used as aids to human decision making). This documentation should include, where available: executive summaries of the algorithm/model's purpose, lists of the data sources, breakdowns of how the model weights various input data, descriptions of the statistical or machine learning techniques employed, the results of validation and accuracy testing, disparate impact studies, and algorithmic impact reports.\r\n\r\n3) A data dictionary/library for each predictive or detection model or algorithm identified in response to items 1 and 2 of this requests.\r\n\r\n4) Copies of any internal or independent audits of the identified models or algorithms.\r\n\r\n5) Aggregate or disaggregated data, if any exists, breaking down the risk scores or outputs of the fraud model.\r\n\r\n6) Training data code and model files for the above algorithms.\r\n\r\nAs required under FOIA, I request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically.\r\n\r\nNews media status and fee waiver:\r\n\r\nAs a reporter for WIRED, I qualify as a news media requester for the purpose of fees. See 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(ii). Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of information regarding the use of predictive analytics will contribute significantly to public understanding of how CMS uses advanced machine learning technology. This request is not primarily in the commercial interest of myself or WIRED.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, please notify me of costs before taking any billable steps.\r\n\r\nSegregability:\r\n\r\nIf you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory\r\nexemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to\r\nonly a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and\r\nprovide the remainder of the record, as required under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my request, please do not hesitate to e-mail me or call\r\nme. Conde Nast's legal counsel is also copied on this letter. We look forward to a response as quickly as possible under the provisions of the Freedom of Information\r\nAct (5 U.S.C. Section 552).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",
