Similarly, if it can be identified what number of forms are attached to a personal 1040 return each year, that would additionally be responsive. \r\n\r\nI checked OMB control numbers 1545-0074 and 1545-0123, but these relate to the omnibus individual & business tax return filings, rather than this specific form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Lee",

Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, NEXT-REQUEST, or JUST FOIA.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, NEXT-REQUEST, or JUST FOIA.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. Please provide a single fee request for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed contemporaneous exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

It is my understanding that you are seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) available regarding any and all internet routers, internet access points, wireless access points, Internet Router, \"Hotspots,\" \"Mobile Hotspots,\" \"Cellular Hotspots,\" and any other physical hardware internet access devices provided by your agency (or donated on behalf of your agency) to employees, contractors, students, or the general public in the years 2022-2025.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records include but are not limited to: invoices, receipts, and costs of the access devices themselves. Also all device serial numbers, device service providers, device IP addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency the years 2022-2025.\r\n\r\nProvide copies of all records documenting the person responsible for the usage of each device.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nThe original estimate needs to be extended, we are still gathering records.\r\n\r\nWe are currently gathering records and at this time I estimate that it will take approximately 1 month to prepare the first installment of records located that are responsive to your request.  This estimate is based on the number of previously pending public records requests that our office is responding to, the time needed to locate and assemble the records requested, the need to determine whether any of the records are exempt from public disclosure, provide third party notice, as well as other work for which I am responsible. This request may be produced in installments. I will contact you on or about March 7, 2025 regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DB843B.5FEEE430]\r\nJoey Christine Grant\r\nPublic Records Manager\r\nEmail: jgrant@tacoma.k12.wa.us<mailto:jgrant@tacoma.k12.wa.us>\n",

        "communication": "I am appealing the denial of requested information by the FAA. It appears that the (b)(6) redactions have been made in bad faith, citing concerns for \"harassment.\" Letter from Susan Northrup to FOIA Requester (Jan 2025).\r\n\r\nThe FOIA's Exemption 6 can only be applied when there would be a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" 5 USC 552(b)(6). The FAA has failed to meet the bar to demonstrate that harassment of AAM-300 employees may occur from the disclosure of  names. Indeed, courts have recognized that \"[g]overnment employees, and specifically law enforcement personnel, have a significant privacy interest in their identities, as the release of their identities may subject them to embarrassment and harassment.\" Halpern v. FBI, 181 F.3d 279, 296-97 (2d Cir. 1999). But, the employees of AAM-300 are not \"law enforcement personnel\" nor have a \"significant privacy interest in their identities\" Id. \u201cAn agency must at least explain the ground for concluding that there is some factual basis for concerns about harassment, intimidation, or physical harm.\u201d United America Financial, Inc. v. Potter, 667 F. Supp. 2d 49, 55 (D.D.C. 2009). The FAA has failed to explain any ground for its \"concerns about harassment\" Id. The Supreme Court has agreed that \"[n]ames and other identifying information do not always present a significant threat to an individual's privacy interest.\" Wood v. F.B.I, 432 F.3d 78, 88 (2d Cir. 2005) (see Department of State v. Ray, 502 U.S. 164 (1991)).\r\n\r\nOPM has recognized that release of information about certain employees in specific job categories may \"constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" See The U.S. Office of Personnel Management Data Release Policy August 2020, (Sept. 1, 2020), https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/data-policy-guidance/data-standards/data-release-policy-august-2020.pdf; 5 USC 552(b)(6). The job codes identified by OPM include officers of the Internal Revenue Service and law enforcement personnel. Absent from OPM's guidance are the job categories that FAA has redacted, such as legal instruments examiners. DOT and similar agencies have already released information for those in the same job category, demonstrating there is no cognizable privacy interest for employees of AAM-300. See, e.g., FedsDataCenter, https://www.fedsdatacenter.com/federal-pay-rates/index.php?y=all&n=&l=&a=&o=LEGAL+INSTRUMENTS+EXAMINING. The information sought is already in the public domain, and FAA employees have \"have no privacy interest in information that is already in the public domain.\" Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 840 F. Supp. 2d 226 (D.D.C. 2012).\r\n\r\nThe FAA has failed to reasonably segregate non-exempt material. Specifically, in the case of names of legal instruments examiners who are exercising delegated approval to sign letters for AMCD Manager, the equities weigh in favor of disclosure, as they have a reduced privacy interest due to their exercising of AMCD Manager's authority.  See Sensor Sys. Support, Inc. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 851 F. Supp. 2d 321, 332 (D.N.H. 2012).\r\n\r\nThe decision of the FAA to withhold the requested information should be reversed and remanded.",

(quoting Dep\u2019t of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. at 380 n.19).

I apologize for the extended time it has taken to answer your email.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Freedom of Information Act requires public bodies to produce public records in their possession. S.C. Code Ann 30-4-30. Thus, I am attaching documents responsive to your requests in 1, 2, and parts of 3, and 5. I will send records responsive, in part, to Requests 6, 8 and 9  in a subsequent email.\r\n\r\nFOIA does not require public bodies to create records.   The Citadel does not maintain \"records showing the current number of each uniform item... remaining in stock.\" Request 3; see also Request 9 (football and basketball uniforms).\r\n\r\nCadets are ultimately responsible for cleaning their own uniforms. Requests 4 and 5.  They may do so through the standard laundry fee or through the on campus dry cleaning and laundry facilities, whose rates are available here<https://www.citadel.edu/auxiliary-services/dry-cleaning-and-laundry/>.  The Citadel includes a laundry fee of () as part of the overall tuition and fees it charges cadets.  The Citadel washes football and basketball uniforms in-house, therefore it does not maintain records of that cost. Requests 10 and 11.\r\n\r\nThe Citadel collects tuition and fees as described here<https://www.citadel.edu/sbs/tuition-fees/>.  It receives appropriations from the State of South Carolina as described here<https://www.scstatehouse.gov/budget.php>. Those funds are used to purchase uniforms issued to football and basketball teams.  Request 7.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, cadets purchase uniforms; they do not rent them. Request 12.\r\n\r\nIf you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Again, I apologize for the delay in providing this response.\r\nMark\r\n\r\n\r\nMark\r\n\r\n[Citadel Logo Barracks Brandmark Navy]<https://citadel.edu/>\r\nMark C.

I apologize for the extended time it has taken to answer your email.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Freedom of Information Act requires public bodies to produce public records in their possession. S.C. Code Ann 30-4-30. It does not require public bodies to create records.  The Citadel does not maintain \"financial records showing ledger level itemized income and expenditures for Uniforms fees\" as you request below.  Creation of such records would require considerable time and expense.  Nonetheless, I am attaching a spreadsheet which describes the uniform items The Citadel requires all cadets to purchase. I am also attaching copies of purchase orders for those items. Pursuant to the College Regulations, available here<https://www.citadel.edu/bov/wp-content/uploads/sites/143/2025/04/College-Regulations.Published-version.pdf>, The Citadel's Board of Visitors has ultimate authority over uniform fees and other required charges to cadets.  A summary of all fees is available here<https://www.citadel.edu/sbs/tuition-fees/>.\r\n\r\nIf you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Written requests for records to state and local agencies in Pennsylvania are generally governed by the Commonwealth\u2019s Right-to-Know Law (RTKL), 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101-67.3104. In accordance with the RTKL, the City has promulgated an Open Records Policy, which requires the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form be used for the submission of written requests pursuant to the RTKL. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.504(a); Dekok v. Lancaster County, AP 2010-1197, 2011 PA O.O.R.D. LEXIS 25 at *5 and n.1 (Pa. O.O.R. Jan. 17, 2011) (holding that in accordance with the RTKL, an agency may adopt a policy requiring the use of the standard statewide form established by the Office of Open Records in order to file a RTK Request); accord Pa. Gaming Control Bd. v. Office of Open Records, 48 A.3d 503 (Pa. Cmmw. 2012). As your request was not submitted on or with the standard statewide form, the City does not consider your request to be a Right-to-Know\u00a0Request pursuant to the RTKL and will process it as an informal request.  You do not have to resubmit your request for the City to respond unless you are specifically informed otherwise. The City reserves the right to require a formal RTK Request be submitted pursuant to the RTKL before releasing records. The City is continuing to process the request you have submitted as an informal request outside the RTKL and will be in touch with you further to respond to your request.  However, if you would like to file a RTK Request, please submit your request on or with the standard statewide Right-to-Know Form and email your request to righttoknowlaw@phila.gov \u2013 please do not reply to this email. Please include this notice with your RTK Request. Please note that if you resubmit your request as a written request pursuant to the RTKL, the City will deem your informal request to have been withdrawn.\u00a0  The City\u2019s Open Records Policy can be found here:\u00a0  https://www.phila.gov/open-records-policy/   The statewide form appears at the end of the City\u2019s Open Records Policy. If you require a hard copy of the form and/or policy, please let me know and one will be provided.  The City reserves the right to assert any and all grounds of denial in its final response to your request.

        "communication": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nThe Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office has received your request for public records and is processing your request. All requests are processed in the order in which they are received, and no requests are prioritized by deadline date. The amount of time to completely process your request depends upon the number of pending requests, volume of material encompassed in the request, and the amount of redaction, if any, that is necessary.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware, if you are requesting records with large amount of body camera videos and or high-profile cases, the time to complete your request may be significantly longer as these cases are often voluminous. Identifying the specific record(s) being requested may help expedite your request. You will be notified once records are made available for you to download or pick up, or if no records are found. Your tracking # is 2111. When checking the status of your request, please send emails to mediarequest@mcso.maricopa.gov and include your tracking #.\r\n\r\n***Pursuant to ARS 39-129, the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office (MCSO) Legal Liaison Section has implemented a fee schedule for requests for video recordings.  The fee for processing video recordings is $25 per each video-hour ($6.25 per quarter hour).  In the event there are contemporaneous multiple requests for the same video, the cost associated with processing the video will be shared equally between all requesting parties at that time. Requests for previously processed videos will be at no cost unless the requestor wishes to receive a hard copy instead of an electronic copy. Fees for hardcopies are listed below. ***\r\n\r\nThe fee breakdown for hard copies are as follows:\r\n\r\nDocuments:                       $.50 for each page\r\n\r\nCD\u2019s:                                      $15.00 each\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis request concerns Executive Order 14185 (\"Restoring America\u2019s Fighting Force\"), available at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/03/2025-02181/restoring-americas-fighting-force. I request a copy of the report required by Section 5 of the Executive Order, which provides: \"Department of Defense Internal Review.  The Secretary of Defense shall conduct an internal review that documents actions taken in pursuit of DEI initiatives, including all instances of race and sex discrimination and activities designed to promote a race- or sex-based preferences system.  The report shall be delivered to the Secretary of Defense within 90 days of the date of this order.\"\r\n\r\nThat report was due on or before April 27, 2025.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.8(e)(1)(i)(B) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\nThe Department has previously granted FIRE expedited processing. See, e.g., FOIA No. 25-F-2201.\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely an Executive Order requiring a report to the Secretary of Defense.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis because it concerns the Secretary's implementation of a presidential policy priority, and because the public's feedback may impact the final report required of the  Task Force's final report required of the Secretary of Defense to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy on or before July 26, 2025. (See Sec. 7(b) of the Executive Order.)  If that information is only disclosed months or years later, it will inhibit the ability of the public to understand how its current officials are making decisions.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-intelligence-arm-dia-pausing-dei-mlk-holocaust-remembrance-and-other-observations/\r\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-radical-gender-ideology-dei-initiatives-military\r\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jan/29/pete-hegseth-creates-new-pentagon-task-force-ban-r/\r\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3302523/trump-executive-orders-military-excellence/\r\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5277155/trump-military-transgender-dei-iron-dome-orders\r\nhttps://freebeacon.com/latest-news/die-dei-trump-signs-executive-order-banning-woke-program-in-military/\r\nhttps://www.defenseone.com/policy/2025/01/hegseth-stands-anti-dei-task-force/402623/\r\nhttps://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-01-30/hegseth-dei-defense-department-promotions-academies-16654199.html\r\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-dod-creates-task-force-abolish-dei-offices-promote-systemic-racism\r\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/defense/5129386-west-point-cadet-clubs-ordered-disband/\r\nhttps://www.stripes.com/branches/air_force/2025-03-20/air-force-base-dei-compliance-visits-17205950.html\r\nhttps://www.expressnews.com/news/article/dei-hegseth-trump-military-dei-air-force-20230989.php\r\nhttps://san.com/cc/naval-academy-removes-close-to-400-books-linked-to-dei-following-dod-order/\r\nhttps://www.fedweek.com/armed-forces-news/dod-task-force-visiting-installations-to-observe-dei-rollback/\r\nhttps://www.iheart.com/content/2025-02-06-west-point-shuts-down-campus-clubs-related-to-race-gender-amid-dei-attacks/\r\nhttps://www.campusreform.org/article/hegseth-orders-end-affirmative-action-admissions-service-academies/27419\r\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/defense/5114409-pence-hegseth-military-promotions-race-sex/\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.12(l), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the policies, procedures, and practices of senior Department officials concerning the Department's policies and programs.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations, as the information pertains to the policies and underlying information driving decisions by senior Department officials. Disclosing the policies and other information would demonstrate the bases for those decisions, which have attracted substantial public attention, as demonstrated by the articles cited above. That information is not in the public domain.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (CPRA) to the  Kings County Probation Department  from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) for records related to AB 2448 (CA Welf & Inst Code \u00a7 851.1. Online:  https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/welfare-and-institutions-code/wic-sect-851-1/), a 2018 law that requires juvenile detention facilities to provide youth in custody with internet access.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this law establishes the following requirements for juvenile detention facilities: \r\n\r\n\u201cMinors detained in or committed to a juvenile hall shall be provided with access to computer technology and the Internet for the purposes of education.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe law also allows juvenile halls to provide access to computers and the internet for \u201cmaintaining relationships with family.\u201d The Chief Probation Officer, or their designee, may \u201climit or deny access to computer technology or the Internet for safety and security or staffing reasons.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe request the following Kings County Probation Department records: \r\n\r\n1. All policies, procedures, practices, manuals, memorandums, orders or related documents that discuss providing minors in juvenile hall with access to computer technology and the internet for educational purposes; \r\n2. All policies, procedures, practices, manuals, memorandums, orders or related documents that discuss providing minors in juvenile hall with access to computer technology and the internet for maintaining familial relationships; \r\n3. All handbooks or similar documents provided to teachers and other instructors that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet in juvenile hall; \r\n4. All handbooks or similar documents provided to minors in juvenile hall that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet; \r\n5. All procurement records, such as RFPs, RFIs, solicitations, successful bids, and contracts/agreements with vendors for technology systems to provide minors in juvenile hall with access to computing and internet-connected technology; \r\n6. Examples of any consent, permission, and similar documents provided to parents and guardians of minors in juvenile hall related to access to computer technology and the internet;\r\n7. Any quarterly, annual, or other periodic reports that summarize the implementation of programs to comply with AB 2448 generated since 2018;\r\n8. Logs, records, or orders related to suspension of internet access, for any amount of time, \u201cfor safety and security or staffing reasons\u201d since 2018; and\r\n9. Aggregate data on the number of juvenile users of computer technology and internet systems for the period 2022 and 2023.\r\n\r\nShould these records not exist, we would appreciate a statement as to whether the agency is in compliance with AB 2448. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we request the following information and assistance, as required under CPRA: \r\n- Assistance in identifying additional records and information that will assist us in understanding the state of the agency\u2019s compliance with AB 2448;\r\n- A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist; and\r\n- Suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records and information sought. \r\n\r\nThe CPRA also requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available.\r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $50.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $50.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the Muckrock.com email above or my direct email, dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy St. San Francisco, CA, 94109, or leave a voicemail message at 415-436-9333 x151.                                          \r\nSincerely,\r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",
