I believe I have wrongfully been placed on the Terrorist Screening Database and I am requesting the records that indicate the person or persons and or entity who has placed me on this list. I am also requesting all records including the Prohibited Access Files and files associated with gang stalking, harassment, and direct energy weapons attacks, which I have been a victim of since approximately January 1st, 2021. Since this date I have experienced targeted noise campaigns which have disrupted my life and have caused psychological distress and torture, sensitized me to specific sound, noise, colors, vehicles, etc and have caused me to be controlled and manipulated out of fear. These campaigns have affected me in a long term way. They have also contributed to legal problems which I am currently dealing with. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Along with the noise campaigns I have been exposed to V2K (Voice to Skull) and RNM also known as Voice to Skull transmissions and Remote Neural Monitoring.  I have been tortured and my privacy has been completely violated. I have been forced to view profane graphic imagery through augmented reality visualization that bypass my optical eyesight and therefore I had no control over these images as well as constant forced dream sequences and dream manipulation. I am tortured night and day. I am exposed to sleep deprivation, sometimes up to 3 or 4 nights with no sleep. My brain and physiology have been pushed to the limits of sanity. Also illegal break ins and artificial tinnitus (constant ringing in my ears). I request records of all these incidents, tactics and procedures.\r\nI request the records that indicate why I have been placed on The Terror Screening Database or other watchlists. I request the financial records and the agency or agencies that have been and who are currently surveilling me and financial records associated in any way with my name. Any financial records that indicate how much money has been spent on me during this program against me. I am requesting all names and individuals payed or coerced to follow me, stalk me, interfere with my life, report against me and any individual or corporation that has been involved in interfering with my life, career, employment, religious affiliations, health care, as well as any infiltration or intimidation, false accusations stated to my family and social circles, employment contacts, friends, acquaintances and romantic partners. I also request records associated with body implants that have been implanted in my body without my knowledge or consent. I request records that indicate any and all direct energy weapons that I have been exposed to radiation, drugs, poisons or viruses and diseases of any kind because of this program. Records of forced sterilization or efforts substances that would or will cause impotence or any sexual dysfunction that have been used on me. I request the records that would indicate anyone I have been associated with who has been threatened, coerced, paid or bribed, harassed or lied to in order to cooperate against me or to collaborate against me in smear campaigns or character assassinations against me or strangers and anonymous persons. In short I request any and all records associated with my name and person under the jurisdiction of any and all \u201cBlack Lists\u201d Terrorist Screening Databases or \u201cWatch Lists\u201d any list which would expose me to all of the above attacks including microwave attacks, microwave frequency attacks, radiation attacks, etc. \r\n\r\nPlease search the FBI\u2019s indices to the central records system for the information responsive to this request related to: All of the above. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am willing to pay up to [any amount \r\n] for the\r\nprocessing of this request.

Therefore, I ask that my request is expedited. When completing this request, please prioritize whichever records would take the least amount of time to be located and released. I would like these records in electronic format, sent via email or other digital method, and again, please release documents on a rolling basis, as they become available.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that any of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, I ask you to note whether the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am a member of the news media as a freelance reporter. As such, the requested documents are in the public interest and not being made for commercial purposes. Therefore, I ask that all fees are waived in the processing of my request. If fees associated with this request will be in excess of $25, kindly notify me in advance of fulfilling this request. As I am making this request as a journalist and this information is timely, I would appreciate your communicating with me if you have questions regarding this request.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and I look forward to your reply within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires and an even more prompt reply if you can make a determination without having to review the records in question.\r\n\r\n-Daniel Boguslaw",
