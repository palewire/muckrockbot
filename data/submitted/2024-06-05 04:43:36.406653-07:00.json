As stated in the Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance Factsheet, \u201cFusion Centers are owned and operated by state and local entities with support from federal partners\u2026\u201d \r\n\r\nPer the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) website, \u201cThe Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) is recognized by the U. S. Department of Homeland Security as the Primary Fusion Center for the state of Missouri.\u201d \r\n\r\nGiven that Fusion Centers are intelligence hubs that gather, analyze and share sensitive information about citizens throughout the state and regions of Missouri, it is essential that the public can see accountability and transparency are prioritized in the day-to-day functions of organizations such as the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC).\r\n\r\nRequested Documents/Records:\r\n\r\nI request that you provide me access to, or copies of: \r\n\r\n1.\tDocuments/records sufficient to show the name and location of the most current appointed custodian of records for the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC). Please include the custodian\u2019s first/last name, title, physical location with room, street address, city, state, email address and direct phone number with extension.  \r\n\r\n2.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show the Missouri Information Analysis Center\u2019s manual of all policies and procedures for processing Missouri Sunshine Law requests. If no manual exists, please provide all other guiding documentation/protocols for the processing of Missouri Sunshine Law requests.  \r\n\r\n3.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show the Missouri Information Analysis Center\u2019s reasonably written policies (in compliance with sections 610.010 to 610.030, RSMo, commonly referred to as the Missouri Sunshine Law) that instructs members of the public on how to request access to public records that are held by the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC).\r\n\r\n4.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show why and how Missouri Sunshine Law public records requests that are addressed to the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), and clearly intended to be received and processed by the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), are being diverted to the Missouri State Highway Patrol.     \r\n\r\n5.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show why and how Missouri Sunshine Law public records requests that are addressed to the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), and clearly intended to be received and processed by the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), are being denied and closed by the Missouri State Highway Patrol for reasons of \u201cno documents responsive\u201d to the requests, when initial requests are not addressed to, sent to, or seeking documents from the Missouri State Highway Patrol. \r\n\r\nRequested Format\r\n\r\nI am respectfully seeking all documents/records through MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply. \r\n\r\nI am requesting that documents/records be sent electronically, preferably as a PDF file attachment. I also request that documents/records be sent in any digital format in which they exist (such as PDF or Excel). If unable to fill the request electronically, please advise me of other alternatives.  \r\n\r\nPer Section 610.024, RSMo, \u201cIf a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the public governmental body shall separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for examination and copying.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf portions of the requested documents/records are closed due to exemption, please segregate the closed portions and provide me with all segregable portions of the documents/records. I also request that you please provide a detailed justification for each redaction or omission, and cite the specific exemption used for each redacted or omitted portion of the original document/records.   \r\n\r\nFee Waiver/Public Interest/Public Release\r\n\r\nAs the records sought detail the operations and activities of local and state government bodies, I also request that fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public\u2019s interest. I am seeking the records to analyze, inform and freely release to members of the public as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com. \r\n\r\nAs stated in Section 610.022, RSMo, \u201cpublic records shall be presumed to be open\u2026documents may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThe subject of the requested documents/records will provide significant increased insight about local and state governmental body\u2019s operations and/or activities around access to public records/documents. The requested records are not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nIf fees cannot be waived, I am willing to pay all reasonable duplication expenses incurred in the processing this Missouri Sunshine Law request. However, as I am a member of the public and requesting documents specifically for the purpose of increasing the public\u2019s knowledge of governmental functioning, I will administratively appeal any denial of my request for a fee waiver. If fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Hawkins",

        "communication": "Dear Kevin Hawkins: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P050008-060524.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G. Callahan \r\nCustodian of Records",

As stated in the Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance Factsheet,  \u201cFusion Centers are owned and operated by state and local entities with support from federal partners\u2026\u201d Given that Fusion Centers are intelligence hubs that gather, analyze and share sensitive information about citizens throughout the state and regions of Missouri, it is essential that the public can see accountability and transparency are prioritized in the day-to-day functions of organizations such as the St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group. \r\n\r\nRequested Documents/Records:\r\n\r\nI request that you provide me access to, or copies of: \r\n\r\n1.\tDocuments/records sufficient to show the name and location of the most current appointed custodian of records for the St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group. Please include the custodian\u2019s first/last name, title, physical location with room, street address, city, state, email address and direct phone number with extension.  \r\n\r\n2.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group\u2019s manual of all policies and procedures for processing Missouri Sunshine Law requests. If no manual exists, please provide all other guiding documentation/protocols for the processing of Missouri Sunshine Law requests.  \r\n\r\n3.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group\u2019s reasonably written policies (in compliance with sections 610.010 to 610.030, RSMo, commonly referred to as the Missouri Sunshine Law) that instructs members of the public on how to request access to public records that are held by the St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group.    \r\n\r\n4.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show why and how Missouri Sunshine Law public records requests that are addressed to the St Louis Fusion Center: Early Terrorism Early Warning Group, and clearly intended to be received and processed by the St Louis Fusion Center: Early Terrorism Early Warning Group are being diverted to the St Louis County Police Department and/or \u201cSt Louis County.\u201d    \r\n\r\n5.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show why and how Missouri Sunshine Law public records requests that are addressed to the St Louis Fusion Center: Early Terrorism Early Warning Group, and clearly intended to be received and processed by the St Louis Fusion Center: Early Terrorism Early Warning Group are being denied and closed by the St Louis County Police Department and/or \u201cSt Louis County\u201d for reasons of \u201cno documents responsive\u201d to the requests, when initial requests are not addressed to, sent to, or seeking documents from the St Louis County Police Department or \u201cSt Louis County.\u201d     \r\n\r\nRequested Format\r\n\r\nI am respectfully seeking all documents/records through MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply. \r\n\r\nI am requesting that documents/records be sent electronically, preferably as a PDF file attachment. I also request that documents/records be sent in any digital format in which they exist (such as PDF or Excel). If unable to fill the request electronically, please advise me of other alternatives.  \r\n\r\nPer Section 610.024, RSMo, \u201cIf a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the public governmental body shall separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for examination and copying.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf portions of the requested documents/records are closed due to exemption, please segregate the closed portions and provide me with all segregable portions of the documents/records. I also request that you please provide a detailed justification for each redaction or omission, and cite the specific exemption used for each redacted or omitted portion of the original document/records.   \r\n\r\nFee Waiver/Public Interest/Public Release\r\n\r\nAs the records sought detail the operations and activities of local and state government bodies, I also request that fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public\u2019s interest. I am seeking the records to analyze, inform and freely release to members of the public as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com. \r\n\r\nAs stated in Section 610.022, RSMo, \u201cpublic records shall be presumed to be open\u2026documents may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThe subject of the requested documents/records will provide significant increased insight about local and state governmental body\u2019s operations and/or activities around access to public records/documents. The requested records are not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nIf fees cannot be waived, I am willing to pay all reasonable duplication expenses incurred in the processing this Missouri Sunshine Law request. However, as I am a member of the public and requesting documents specifically for the purpose of increasing the public\u2019s knowledge of governmental functioning, I will administratively appeal any denial of my request for a fee waiver. If fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Hawkins",

These included:\r\n\uf06e \u201cShockwave\u201d in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Central Region during the\r\n1970s and 1980s (see the next section of this chapter for a more complete description);\r\n\uf06e SORAK (N.E. Asian theater) [37];  \r\n\uf06e Pershing IA and ground launched cruise missile (GLCM) endurance experimentation\r\nduring the 1980s [38]; \r\n\uf06e Horizontal and vertical dispersion of dual\u2010capable aircraft (DCA) to improve theater\r\nnuclear force (TNF)\u2010DCA force endurance. \r\n...\r\n\u201cShockwave\u201d (mentioned in the previous section) was a comprehensive, successful, TNF\u2010related\r\nthreat\u2010monitoring/understanding effort that ran from about 1978 to about 1985. It is discussed\r\nhere as an effective antecedent of future, comprehensive TNF threat\u2010monitoring systems which\r\nwould benefit from improved technologies and possibly from negotiated limits and monitoring.\r\nThe purpose of Shockwave was to understand improvements in the ability of the\r\nSoviet/Warsaw Pact (WP) to execute a swift, successful campaign inside U.S. and NATO\r\ntimelines for nuclear employment, and thus to aid selection among U.S. and NATO options to\r\ncounter those improvements. It used a wide range of U.S. national, theater, and tactical\r\nmonitoring means, from both the Army and Air Force, as well as similar Allied means where\r\nappropriate.    The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Defense\r\nNuclear Agency (DNA) were major players in developing new monitoring capabilities. Exercises\r\nusing NATO forces were used to elicit responses in later WP exercises that could be observed by\r\nShockwave assets. The effort was led by successive SACEURs, with integration at both Supreme\r\nHeadquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) and United States European Command (EUCOM)\r\nheadquarters. Over the 7\u20108 years it was run, Shockwave was highly successful.  In fact, it serves\r\nas a premier example of how persistent, comprehensive monitoring for threat\u2010assessment\r\npurposes can pay off\r\n\r\n[37] SORAK was a South Korean experimentation concept developed in the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s based on\r\nShock Wave.    It was sponsored by Commander\u2010in\u2010Chief, U.S. Pacific Command (CINCPAC) and supported by\r\nDARPA, as part of the joint United States\u2010 South Korean exercise Ulchi Focus Lens.  The concept was intended to\r\ncreate an all source testing capability to observe operations.   \r\n[38] Pershing II and GLCM operations were driven by the need for survivability in moving units out of peacetime\r\ngarrison in crisis and in move\u2010and\u2010hide tactics in the field in crisis and war. These operations were developed\r\niteratively using red\u2010teamed test\u2010bed exercises coupled with simulations, both in CONUS and in Europe\"\r\n\r\nIf it helps make the scope of the search easier, I am only interested in the planning and use of NATO Forces to \"elicit responses in later WP exercises that could be observed by\r\nShockwave assets.\"\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrian Mills",

She had been abducted near her bus stop in Englewood, Colorado the night prior and she had also been sexually assaulted. In 2019, James Curtis Clanton was arrested for Helene\u2019s murder, and he was sentenced to life in prison in 2020.  According to detectives in this case the department used a forensic psychic or a subject under hypnosis, among other tools, to help hunt down Prusynski's murderer.  I am looking for records reflecting the number of cases psychics or hypnosis has been used by the department since the year 2000.  Such records should include contracting records as well as investigatory records produced by the forensic psychic or the hypnosis .\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This request includes both classified and unclassified documents, as well as records pending declassification.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tFolders and Indexes: Any folders, indexes, or finding aids for records related to Afro-German children in the Rhineland.\r\n\t2.\tDeclassified Documents: Any declassified documents, reports, or communications related to Afro-German children in the Rhineland.\r\n\t3.\tClassified and Pending Declassification Documents: Any classified documents or those pending declassification that pertain to Afro-German children in the Rhineland.\r\n\t4.\tTranscripts: Transcripts of communications between U.S. government entities and German authorities concerning Afro-German children in the Rhineland.\r\n\t5.\tInvestigations: Records of any investigations or assessments conducted by U.S. agencies involving Afro-German children in the Rhineland.\r\n\t6.\tCorrespondences: Correspondences between U.S. government officials discussing Afro-German children in the Rhineland.\r\n\t7.\tSocial Reports: Documents and reports on the social and economic conditions of Afro-German children in the Rhineland.\r\n\t8.\tMilitary Records: Information on U.S. military observations and activities related to Afro-German children in the Rhineland.\r\n\t9.\tCultural Exchanges: Records of cultural exchange programs or collaborations involving Afro-German children in the Rhineland.\r\n\t10.\tHuman Rights Assessments: Documents related to human rights assessments or impact studies involving Afro-German children in the Rhineland.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980). Additionally, per the Presidential Records Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 22) and Executive Order 13526 (Classified National Security Information), agencies are required to appropriately handle records of historical interest.\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. The public interest standard is further supported by the criteria established in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)). Given the complexity and scope of this request, I understand it may take additional time to process. Therefore, I request an update on the status of my request within thirty business days. I am willing to accommodate a one-time extension, provided that I am informed in advance with a specific time frame for the extension.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com.
