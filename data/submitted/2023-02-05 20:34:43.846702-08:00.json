His death is widely-known and widely reported, and was even the subject of a February 2020 documentary by BBC Persian; as such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nQotbzadeh immigrated to the United States in 1959, and attended Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service from 1959 to 1963. He participated in student protests against the Iranian government, and stormed a party held by Ardeshir Zadehi, then-Iranian ambassador in Washington. Soviet defector Vladimir Kuzichkin later claimed in his 1991 book, Inside the KGB: Myth and Reality, that Qotbzadeh had been an agent of Soviet military intelligence during this time.\r\n\r\nQotbzadeh became a close aides to the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and participated in the overthrow of the Iranian monarchy and the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He was arrested in April 1982 on charges of plotting a coup d'etat, and was executed in September of that year.\r\n\r\nI previously requested records for Qotbzadeh, request number 1484136-000.\r\n\r\nIn your 29 January 2021 response to that request, you noted that \r\n\r\nAs I wrote in my initial 22 December 2020 request, \"If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\" However, your 29 January 2021 response letter states that you \"consider [the] request fulfilled\" after releasing documents from a previous search. As the letter continues, \"additional records potentially responsive to your subject may exist,\" and I \"may request an additional search for records.\"\r\n\r\nI am requesting that additional search.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records of both HQ and all field offices for all relevant names, agencies, organizations, companies and events including but not limited to those cited in the previous paragraphs and/or links as well as a cross-reference with the Southern Poverty Law Center to include any information provided by the SPLC. My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files. \r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please include all policies and procedures related to how fees are set, accrued, imposed, collected, and enforced (such as those related to per diem fees, ability to pay determinations, penalties for late or non-payment, authorization for civil or criminal action for payment enforcement, etc).\r\n\r\nAll reports, databases, spreadsheets, or equivalent materials regarding debts/restitution paid to or owed to this department/office or any facility/agency under its jurisdiction in FY2021. Please include all relevant data regarding medical and room & board costs, including the number of youths (i.e., juveniles) charged for medical and room & board costs or fees and the total amount of medical and room & board fees imposed in FY2021.\r\n\r\nPursuant to KRS 26A.200, all records which are made by, generated for, or received by an agency of the Kentucky Court of Justice (KCOJ) are the property of the KCOJ and are subject to the control of the Kentucky Supreme Court and are not subject to statutory regulation, including the Kentucky Open Records Act. Ex Parte Farley, 570 S.W.2d 617 (Ky. 1978). Even though court records are not subject to the Kentucky Open Records Act, the KCOJ endeavors to accommodate all requests for records unless the request is overly burdensome or disruptive to court business.\r\n\r\nAccess to AOC administrative records is governed by the Rules of Administrative Procedure Part XVII (\"AP Part XVII\"), adopted by Supreme Court Order 2017-09, which constitutes the Open Records Policy of the Administrative Office of the Courts (\"AOC Open Records Policy\"), attached.\r\n\r\nFor its response, AOC states it does not possess any records responsive to your request.  The Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet, Department of Juvenile Justice is responsible for the care of detained youth in Kentucky and would be the proper custodian for the records you seek.  Information on filing your request with the Department of Juvenile Justice can be found at: Open Records Requests - Department of Juvenile Justice (ky.gov)<https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdjj.ky.gov%2Forr%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx&data=05%7C01%7CDanielleCraig%40kycourts.net%7Caa07ce69e6f24aed5dd308db061dbd2d%7C56e9b0b51da640f9ad00f944fd870af4%7C0%7C0%7C638110497051865097%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=n0%2B159t27NOGX4AvSVJ5iR1ZnnD37j%2FuIqk66H0x2E8%3D&reserved=0>.\r\n\r\nI hope you find this information helpful.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nDanielle M.
