Victoria Avenue\r\nVentura, CA 93009\r\nEmail: info.vcsd@ventura.org\r\n\r\nFrom:\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\n\r\nSubject: CPRA Request \u2013 Assault Incident Involving Joshua Block and Santos (April 23, 2025)\r\n\r\n\u2e3b\r\n\r\nDear Custodian of Records,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act (CPRA), Government Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250\u20136276.48, and California Constitution Article I, \u00a7 3(b), I respectfully request access to public records related to an assault (non-domestic) incident involving Joshua Block and an individual identified as Santos, which occurred in Ventura County on or about April 23, 2025, at approximately 7:00 PM (19:00 hours).\r\n\r\n\u2e3b\r\n\r\nRecords Requested:\r\n\t1.\tBody-Worn Camera Footage\r\n\t\u2022\tAll body-worn camera (BWC) recordings from deputies who responded to the incident.\r\n\t2.\t911 Call Audio and Transcripts\r\n\t\u2022\tAll emergency call recordings and transcripts related to this incident.\r\n\t3.\tCAD / Dispatch Logs\r\n\t\u2022\tFull dispatch data including unit assignments, timestamps, and call notes.\r\n\t4.\tIncident and Arrest Reports\r\n\t\u2022\tAll reports created in connection with this assault, including officer narratives, witness statements, investigative reports, and any arrest documentation.\r\n\t5.\tPhotographs or Supplemental Evidence\r\n\t\u2022\tAny digital evidence, such as photographs or surveillance obtained during the response.\r\n\t6.\tPreservation Notice\r\n\t\u2022\tI formally request that all potentially responsive records be preserved, including digital and metadata. Alteration or deletion of such records after receipt of this request may constitute a violation of Gov. Code \u00a7 6200 and legal precedent such as People v. Superior Court (Barrett), 80 Cal.App.4th 1305 (2000).\r\n\r\n\u2e3b\r\n\r\nLegal Justification:\r\n\t\u2022\tGov. Code \u00a7 6254(f) provides for public access to law enforcement response records including arrest information, time, location, and substance of calls.\r\n\t\u2022\tAB 748 (Gov. Code \u00a7 6254(f)(4)) mandates the disclosure of body-worn camera footage in incidents involving the use of force or where the public interest in disclosure clearly outweighs any investigatory need for withholding.\r\n\t\u2022\tCourts in CBS v. Block, 42 Cal.3d 646 (1986) and Haynie v. Superior Court, 26 Cal.4th 1061 (2001) require narrowly tailored justifications for any denial or redaction of law enforcement records.\r\n\t\u2022\tThe public\u2019s right to information that fosters accountability is further supported by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and People v. Superior Court (Johnson), 61 Cal.4th 696 (2015).\r\n\r\n\u2e3b\r\n\r\nFormat & Fee Waiver Request:\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in electronic format (PDF, MP4, etc.). I also request a waiver of fees under Gov. Code \u00a7 6253(e), as this request is made for public interest purposes and not commercial use.\r\n\r\nIf any fees are expected, I request a written estimate before incurring any charges.\r\n\r\n\u2e3b\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this request and provide an estimated date for completion in accordance with Gov. Code \u00a7 6253(c). I am available to assist in clarifying or narrowing this request if necessary.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nAs background information, on 4/22/2022, I submitted a request with tracking number  NARA-NGC-2022-001048. I requested all emails to or from NARA from the external domain @dp.la. This was eventually rejected as overly broad\u2014which I object to, as my belief is it would only have amounted to a few dozen emails, and I was given no answer to my follow up to understand the difficulty. In any case, in the rejection from NARA, the following was stated:\r\n\r\n\"However, the requester needs to be specific in identifying the type of record; the topic or subject covered by the record, and an approximate date for the record. The FOIA does not require agencies to conduct research, answer questions, or analyze data. Your request does not give the information necessary to identify potentially Federal responsive records. Could you please provide a specific department (within NARA) that you believe may have communicated with the organization cited in your FOIA request?\"\r\n\r\nIn response, I would like to narrow/reformulate my request to emails with specific keywords found only in emails to/from specific NARA staff email addresses, within a limited date range. Please see this more limited list of 10 NARA employees:\r\n\r\n* Hannah Bergman <hannah.bergman@nara.gov>\r\n* Jason Clingerman <jason.clingerman@nara.gov>\r\n* David Ferriero <david.ferriero@nara.gov> or <archivistoftheunitedstates@nara.gov>\r\n* Valorie Findlater <valorie.findlater@nara.gov>\r\n* Carol Lagundo <carol.lagundo@nara.gov>\r\n* Maureen MacDonald <maureen.macdonald@nara.gov>\r\n* Gary M. Stern <garym.stern@nara.gov>\r\n* Debra Wall <debra.wall@nara.gov>\r\n* Andrew Wilson <andrew.wilson@nara.gov>\r\n* Pamela Wright <pamela.wright@nara.gov>\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. All emails, including attachments, sent to or from the above listed NARA staff members, from the period of August 1, 2019 to December 31 , 2020 which contain the terms \"Digital Public Library of America\" or \"DPLA\".\r\n\r\n2. Google Chat messages from the same individuals and same time frame with the matching search terms, as well as the 10 messages occurring before or after them (to capture the context).\r\n\r\nBecause NARA is a member of the association being searched for, I have reason to believe there will be responsive records. I do not believe the number will be excessive, because this is not a major component of NARA's work, but if you still believe the request needs to be narrowed, despite the very specific ways in which I have already given parameters for the document search, then I would appreciate additional details as to what makes it excessive (e.g. if a search was done and what the number of emails was).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTR",
