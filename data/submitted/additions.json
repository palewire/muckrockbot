Specifically, I am seeking records for all stops conducted in Virginia, including the following details:\r\n\r\nAgency name\r\nIncident Record ID\r\nDate and time of the stop\r\nStop location\r\nWhether use of force was used\r\n\r\nI am seeking this data at the individual stop level for all available records, up to and including November 2024. While I understand some data is published on the open data portal, this request is intended to obtain the most recent data not yet published.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Taeho Kim.",
