Your request is made pursuant to the provisions of the Nebraska Public Records Act. In your request dated April 29, 2024 you sought information related to date of stop, time of stop, race of driver, gender of driver, age of driver, if search occurred, if contraband was found, anonymized officer ID, and stop location for all years available. This is the response required by NEB. REV. STAT. \u00a7 84-712, et seq. The Nebraska public records statute allows persons the right to examine public records in the possession of public agencies during normal agency business hours, to make memorandum and abstracts from those public records, and to obtain copies of public records in certain circumstances. The statute does not require a public agency to review documents and create abstracts or other lists, to answer questions, or to create documents that do not otherwise exist. See NEB.REV.STAT. \u00a7 84-712. Although the Nebraska public records statutes provided for access to public documents, such access is not absolute. The statutes also provide for exceptions to disclosures by express and special provisions; there are 21 categories of documents that may be kept confidential from the public at the discretion of the agency involved. See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 84-712.05. I have attached the available data we were able to pull from our database to the portal attachment tab for your refereence. There are random blanks for race, gender, and location in the data. All fields are supposed to be filled out, however, based on my experience with drop down boxes on our cruiser computers, the occassional clerical error can occur as the information doesn't always populate from the drop down menu. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this. Section 84-712.03 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes may grant you the right to administrative or judicial review of this response. Please consult the statute for further information. Chief of Police Todd Schmaderer is responsible for denying a portion of your request. Thank you for your patience in my response to this request. If you have any questions about the legal basis for this response, please contact me at 402.444.5259.",

Records that show all CPS incidents that included a student referral to law enforcement, including school-based resource officers, the underlying offense, the result of each referral, such as arrest or ticket/citation for municipal ordinance violation, and the gender, race, disability status and ELL status of the students who were referred for the 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and the 2023-2024 school years. Please also include the school in the data breakdown. The records could include, but not be limited to, disciplinary logs or reports, incident logs or reports, behavior resolution reports, and data that reflects the referrals, arrests and citations during the above years. \r\n2. The number of arrests of students on CPS property from July 1, 2021 to current broken down by CPS property name and address. Please break this data down by age of arrestee. RESPONSE : A portion of the information you seek can be found online. Please visit the CPS data website which includes police notification information: https://www.cps.edu/about/district-data/metrics/ . Scroll to the bottom of the page and download the spreadsheets beside the \u201cSuspensions and Expulsions\u201d header. \r\nBe advised that you may wish to submit a FOIA request to the Chicago Police Department (CPD) for \u201carrests of students\u201d information at the following website: https://home.chicagopolice.org/inside-cpd/freedom-of-information-act-foia/ . \r\nPursuant to 5 ILCS 140/8.5: Records maintained online. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, to the contrary, a public body is not required to copy a public record that is published on the public body\u2019s website. The public body shall notify the requester that the public record is available online and direct the requester to the website where the record can be reasonably accessed. \r\nAs to the remainder of your request, be advised that the CPS FOIA office has determined that it does not properly identify a document(s) for search and would require a CPS FOIA Officer to conduct research and create a new record. To search for the information you seek in the manner requested, a FOIA Officer would need to go to various departments, research, create a list of possible responsive records, and answer questions, which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. \r\nUnder the Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. \r\nFurther, section 1 of FOIA states in part: \u201cThis Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\u201d In accordance with Section 1 of the Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer your questions or prepare researched records on your behalf in response to your request. In the case of a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Ana Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney, and to expedite the request. \r\n\r\nI am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. PDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

We are not the records custodian for that office, and will only have responsive records to the extent that such records were sent to or from the Office of the Governor.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, to the extent we have responsive records, we will endeavor to respond to your request. I have broken out our responses/requests for clarification below, corresponding to the separate items in your request:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.\r\nWe do not have records responsive to this request.\r\n\r\n  2.\r\nPlease clarify the scope of this request. First, there are no search terms or keywords identified for this request. Second, the request includes \"communications...to or from...any person employed by the State of Georgia Government, on the one hand, and any elected official...or any member of the staff of an elected official, on the other hand.\" Interpreted literally and applied to the Office of the Governor, this would essentially cover every email sent to or from our office to any state employee, regardless of subject or keywords. This is likely to return thousands of documents and incur significant costs. Please confirm whether this is the intended scope of your request.\r\n\r\n  3.\r\nPlease clarify the scope of this request. Similar to part (2), this request includes \"communications...to or from...any person employed by the State of Georgia Government, on the one hand, and any elected official...or any member of the staff of an elected official, on the other hand.\" With the inclusion of the specified keywords, there are likely to be somewhat fewer responsive documents, but I am not sure whether this is the intended scope.\r\n\r\n     *\r\nTo the extent that this request was intended to cover only communications between employees of or persons associated with the University of Georgia, on the one hand, and the Office of the Governor, on the other, the responsive records would be identical to those provided to you on May 8th (attached).\r\n  4.\r\n\r\n  5.\r\nThere is no request following \"4\" below.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you would like us to interpret this request, and if you wish, provide any additional clarification to your request. We can then provide you an estimate of the response time or the fees, if any.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nSam Hatcher\r\n\r\nDeputy Executive Counsel\r\n\r\nOffice of Governor Brian P.

Please do not reply to this e-mail. ***\r\nThank you for submitting your open records request under the Public Information Act (PIA) to the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC). Your request has been forwarded to the PUC\u2019s Public Information Coordinator. The Public Information Coordinator will address PIA requests in the order they are received, but in all cases within the time prescribed by law.\r\nTime To Respond\r\nWe will promptly respond to your request by providing the requested information, informing you there is no responsive information, or notifying you all or a portion of the requested information falls under an exception to public disclosure and requires a ruling from the Office of the Attorney General (OAG). If the requested information does not fall under an exception to public disclosure but will take longer than 10 business days to produce, we will notify you of the date and time the information will be provided.\r\nRequest for Clarification\r\nYou can help us respond more quickly to your request by ensuring that your request is clear, specific, and requests only the information you wish to receive. We do our best to relate requests to the information we have and do not require records to be requested by their specific names, but if you know the specific name of the record you are requesting, it will help us respond more efficiently.\r\nIf your request is vague or overly broad, we may, in compliance with Texas Government Code \u00a7 552.222, request clarification in order to ensure we understand what information you are requesting.  Also, please keep in mind that we are not required under the PIA to create new information, do legal research, or answer questions.  See Open Records Decision Nos. 555 and 563 at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/open-government/open-records-decisions.\r\nWithholding Information\r\nAlthough the PIA makes most government information available to the public, some exceptions exist. If we believe an exception applies, we will notify you that the information cannot be released and request a ruling from the OAG.\r\nCosts\r\nYou may be charged for costs associated with responding to your request.  Personnel time is charged at $15 per hour, plus 20% of the personnel charge for overhead. There is also a charge of $0.10 per page, plus personnel time, if the request exceeds fifty pages, plus postage. These rates are set by the OAG.  You can find more information regarding costs associated with PIA requests here: https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=4&ti=1&pt=3&ch=70&rl=Y.\r\nFor more information regarding access to public information held by the PUC, please visit our website at https://www.puc.texas.gov/agency/about/contact/PIA.aspx.\r\n\r\nYou may also find more detailed information regarding the PIA in Texas Government Code Chapter 552 or on the OAG\u2019s website at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/open-government/members-public.\n",

The request does not duplicate a major category of records, and does not seek \"all records containing particular words\" or \"every report filed with the public office for a particular time period\". My request asked for only specific reports during a specific time span, and only for records that were pertaining to a specific topic.\r\n\r\nSince you disagreed as to the narrowness of that request, allow me to modify the request to be even more specific and provide additional information to help you ascertain which records are responsive:\r\n\r\nA copy of any PDF, Word Document, InDesign Document, and/or email, received by COTA's Office of the President, which was originally sent by the Ice Miller law firm or its affiliate Whiteboard, received in the years 2020 or 2021, containing or about a particular report, hereinafter referred to as \"the report\". The report is the final report in a study which was commissioned by COTA, which explored various ways to fund the portion of COTA's budget which is currently sourced from passenger fares, in the event that COTA decided to make passenger fares free. The report was commissioned about three years ago (2018-2020) and completed about a year later (2020-2021). The study and report were paid for in part using COTA funds. The report may be referred to as \"the Ice Miller report\" in casual usage. I am interested in the final report document, in whatever format it was provided in.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know whether you require additional detail to identify this report.",

        "communication": "Hi Nicole,\r\n\r\nI disagree with your characterization of my request as \"ambiguous and overly broad\" as follows:\r\n\r\n1. \"all records containing particular words\" - This request is for a specific report with an identified subject matter, not \"all records\" containing particular words.  \r\n2. \"duplication for all records having to do with a particular topic\" - This request is for a specific report pertaining to a particular topic, not all records pertaining to that topic.  \r\n3. \"all records of a particular type\" - This request is for a specific report in whatever format it may be in, not all records of a particular type or format.  \r\n4. \"all emails sent or received by a particular email address with no subject matter or time limitation\" - This request is for a specific report. In the event that that report may have been transmitted by email, the email is identified with subject matter and time limitations.  \r\n5. \"all documents which document any and all instances of a particular topic\" - This request is for a specific report, with certain identifying characteristics noted in the request. This is not a request for all documents which discuss this report's topic.  \r\n6. \"discovery-style requests that seek all records relating to or reflecting certain types of information\" - This request is limited by date range, the name of the report's author, the report's subject matter, and the type of document containing the report. This is a request for a specific report. It is not a discovery-style request.   \r\n\r\nBelow, I have rephrased my request in order to make it clearer which records I am requesting. I have also included additional information about the requested record, which further narrows the scope of the request.\r\n\r\nI request a copy of a report in COTA's possession. The report has all of the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. Prepared by Ice Miller or its affiliate Whiteboard\r\n2. Originally sent by the Ice Miller law firm or its affiliate Whiteboard\r\n3. Received by COTA in December 2022 or in January 2021\r\n4. Titled \"Fare-Free Transit Analysis\" or with similar words\r\n5. With a subject matter of free public transportation or fare-free transit\r\n6. Commissioned by COTA, and paid for in some part using COTA funds\r\n\r\nThe following details are provided to help you in your search, but the requested document may not meet all or any of these characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. The report may have been attached to an email from Michael.Coleman@icemiller.com or from an @icemiller.com email address\r\n2. The email or report may be dated December 4, 2020, or later\r\n3. The email or report may mention Robert Miller, a past COTA Board member\r\n4. The report may have been included in an email sent to Joanna Pinkerton, to PinkertonJM@cota.com, to another COTA employee in the COTA Office of the President at that time, to Terry Foegler, and/or to Sophia Mohr\r\n\r\nIn the event that multiple versions of the report are discovered, I request the final version of the report. In the event that the report is available in multiple formats, I request the digital version of the PDF, Word Document, or other original document(s) sent to COTA. In the event that the report is split across multiple files or documents (such as a cover letter, a slide deck, and appendices), I request those documents which are necessary to compile the complete report. In the event that the report was submitted by electronic mail to COTA, I also request a copy of the email that was used to send the files comprising the report, in addition to the report files themselves.\r\n\r\nIf this information is still insufficient to identify the responsive records, then pursuant to ORC 149.43(B)(2) I request a copy of COTA's document retention schedule, and information on the manner in which records are retained by COTA and its Office of the President and accessed in the ordinary course of the office's duties.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBenjamin Keith",

Please\r\nrefer to this number should you have any questions concerning your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have placed you in the News Media category for fee purposes, which means\r\nyou are obligated to pay all duplication costs after the first 100 pages.\r\nIn addition, a fee agreement is the amount you would give consent to pay\r\nassociated with the processing of a request for information.  In the future,\r\nalong with your request for information, it will be necessary for you to\r\nsubmit a fee agreement stating the costs you are willing to incur before\r\nyour request can continue to be processed. Upon receipt of your fee\r\nagreement, your request would then be processed in accordance with\r\nprocedural requirements promulgated in Department of Defense (DoD)\r\nRegulation 5400.07, which is available on the internet at\r\n<https://open.defense.gov/Portals/23/Documents/FOIA/FOIA_Resources/DoDM%2054\r\n00.07.pdf?ver=2017-03-15-135646-847>\r\nhttps://open.defense.gov/Portals/23/Documents/FOIA/FOIA_Resources/DoDM%20540\r\n0.07.pdf?ver=2017-03-15-135646-847.  If we believe processing fees would\r\nexceed your cost agreement, we would advise.

Specifically, I am requesting: \r\n\r\n1) All policies, procedures, memorandums of understanding, intergovernmental agreements, any other sort of agreement, and all related directive materials regarding the transfer of incarcerated persons between different facilities within New York state. \r\n\r\n2) From 1/1/2020 through 12/31/2021 specifically: all documents, papers, letters, email correspondence, memoranda, training materials, presentations, directives, guidance, press releases, or other communications (both internal and external) about transfers and COVID-19. This includes \u2013 but is not limited to \u2013 any memos, emails, or directives issued/produced in 2020 or 2021 that discuss transfer procedures and mention COVID-19, health precautions, and/or respiratory illness. It also includes (but is not limited to) any memos, emails, or directives issued/produced in 2020 or 2021 that discuss changes to the frequency of transfers in response to the virus (e.g., halting transfers, minimizing transfers, transferring at-risk incarcerated people, etc.). \r\n\r\n3) Any contracts or agreements regarding inter-prison transfers, including but not limited to a contract with a private transfer company, vehicle purchasing or leasing, and so on.\r\n\r\nNOTE ON DEFINITION: By inter-prison transfer, I am referring to any non-temporary change in an incarcerated person\u2019s housing facility. In other words, any movement of an incarcerated person that would change their \u201cHousing/Releasing Facility,\u201d as recorded in DOCCS\u2019s \u201cIncarcerated Lookup\u201d database. This would include \u2013 but is not limited to \u2013 movements resulting from disciplinary proceedings (i.e., raised security level or other safety risks), movements to lower security facilities, transfers resulting from incarcerated person-initiated transfer requests, transfers preceding facility closure, and/or transfers to accommodate medical, program, or other needs. If the records provided refer to movements more broadly than this definition of transfers, that is acceptable and please send them. However, if there are records that refer ONLY to types of movements that would not include inter-prison transfers as defined here, they fall outside of this request. If there is any question about this, please feel free to reach out and I am happy to clarify.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your reply objects to the City's denial of access pursuant to OPRA's security exemption and based upon protecting the citizens' reasonable expectation of privacy who attended the Teaneck demonstration held on March 10, 2024.  The City evaluated its prior response in light of your reply, and its position remains that you are not legally entitled to access the requested materials.  In addition to the reasons set forth in the City's March 14, 2024 response, an additional reason that the requested materials are exempt from public access is that the underlying footage constitutes law enforcement records relating to citizens who were neither arrested nor charged.  See Fuster v. Twp. of Chatham, 477 N.J. Super. 477 (App. Div. 2023) (determining that government records involving a person who has not been arrested or charged with an offense are entitled to confidentiality based upon long-established judicial precedent).  As such, the City is legally precluded from releasing any footage of citizens generated during the March 10th demonstration.  We trust that this correspondence satisfies your concerns, and we again note that the City is closing out your OPRA request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor O'Brien (she/her)\r\nCity Clerk's Office - OPRA Clerk\r\n65 Central Avenue, 3rd Floor\r\nHackensack, NJ 07601\r\n(P): 201-646-3940\r\n(F): 201-457-1466\r\ntobrien@hackensack.org<mailto:tobrien@hackensack.org>",

Your reply requests that the City reconsider its prior denial of access based upon \"your strong common law right to access the video in order to monitor the police department's use of surveillance techniques on First Amendment activities and to better understand what occurred during the protest.\"  You further asserted that the blurring of faces would suffice to protect any privacy interests.\r\n\r\nIn light of your asserted interest in accessing the responsive footage and the fact that the attendees' identities cannot be ascertained from review of the footage, the City has decided to release said footage to you pursuant to the common law right of access.  Please be advised that the City is unable to provide the responsive footage electronically.  The footage will be placed on a thumb drive and mailed to you.  Kindly send us $12.11 for the cost of the thumb drive and certified mailing; we will promptly send you the footage upon receipt of same.\r\n\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation,\r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor O'Brien (she/her)\r\nCity Clerk's Office - OPRA Clerk\r\n65 Central Avenue, 3rd Floor\r\nHackensack, NJ 07601\r\n(P): 201-646-3940\r\n(F): 201-457-1466\r\ntobrien@hackensack.org<mailto:tobrien@hackensack.org>",

If your FOIPA Number is [1195846-1] please enter [1195846-001] into the system. If you have any questions about the status of your FOIPA request, please e-mail foipaquestions@fbi.gov.\r\n\r\nFIND STATUS OF FOIPA- Request statuses are updated weekly\r\n\r\nPlease enter the whole FOIPA number-Example: [1234567-000]\r\n\r\nFOIPA:\r\nResults will show the Request Number, Case Type and Process Description shown below:\r\nFOIPA:\r\n1234567-000\r\nCase Type:\r\nFOIPA\r\nProcess Description (Will display the current progress of the request)\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s FOIPA Program is searching the FBI\u2019s indices for potentially responsive documents.\r\n\r\nYou may be contacted via formal letter for all fees and/or negotiation issues that may apply.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Recent requests are entered into the FOIPA database in the order that they are received. Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 360 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nApoorvaa Mandar Bichu",

McVeigh's lawyers declined to say whether he would request a stay of the execution.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. McVeigh is going to think about it and decide how he wants to proceed,\" Chambers told the Associated Press. Chambers and Rob Nigh, McVeigh's other attorney, did not respond to repeated calls seeking comment.\r\n\r\nJustice Department officials said the documents were missed in previous searches of computerized files in FBI field offices around the country, and located only recently during a routine archiving of records.

Any current or past contracts or master agreements with vendors who provide case management systems and/or e-filing systems;\r\n  2.  Any publicly posted solicitation for such contracts or agreements;\r\n  3.  All bids received for each procurement;\r\n  4.  All bid evaluations for all bids;\r\n  5.  The final scoring sheets for each procurement.\r\n\r\nWe have determined that the Judicial Council has the correct disclosable responsive records.  Portions of the records have been redacted pursuant to rule 10.500(e)(1)(C), (f)(3).)\r\n\r\nThe file sizes exceed the limits of our e-mail server; therefore, we are providing you the records using a secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) site.\r\n\r\nTo retrieve the requested records, open your web browser and follow the steps below.\r\n\r\n1.     Go to https://ftp.jud.ca.gov<https://ftp.jud.ca.gov/> and the login box for the SFTP site will appear.\r\n2.     Type in the user name: pajarguest.\r\n3.     Type in the password: inforequest.\r\n4.     Click on the file: MacArthur - Disclosures.zip\r\n5.     Select the location where you want to save each file and click OK.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to use Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge, the instructions are almost the same.  The only difference would be that, in the fifth step, you would open files from a pop-up box on the screen.  If you have difficulties, you may need to hit refresh, check your network settings, or check your firewall settings. The documents will be available for download from the SFTP site for approximately 7 to 10 days.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the SFTP site will lock you out if the system detects any of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n  *   your computer or device is seeking to connect from a malicious or unsafe server;\r\n  *   your computer or device contains potentially infected software;\r\n  *   you have made too many login attempts in a short interval; or\r\n  *   you made too many unsuccessful login attempts in a short interval.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that we cannot offer specific technical assistance if you have difficulty using the SFTP site.  If this occurs, we can make alternative arrangements to provide the responsive records such as by mailing a flash drive or hard copies, or by arranging an in-person inspection.  You would be responsible for the costs of any copying, shipping, handling, or materials in such circumstances.  (Cal.

RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your FOIA request are available to download via the Chicago Public Schools FOIA Center. Please visit the following link and enter your username and password to access the records: http://cps.edu/About_CPS/Departments/Law/Pages/FOIARequest.aspx Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Be advised that private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; that data has been withheld, including Federal Tax Identification Number and other bank information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(g), \u201cTrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person or business where the trade secrets or commercial or financial information are furnished under a claim that they are proprietary, privileged or confidential, and that disclosure of the trade secrets or commercial or financial information would cause competitive harm on the person or business, and only insofar as the claim directly applies to the records requested.\u201d Additionally, records have been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(m): Communications between a public body and an attorney or auditor representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body, and materials prepared or compiled with respect to internal audits of public bodies. Furthermore, 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f) exempts any \u201cPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations,\u00a0memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body.\u201d Lastly, identifiable student information included within records are exempt from disclosure pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5(r) in accordance with Illinois Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at its direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored. 105 ILCS 10/(d): Release of a minor\u2019s record may only be authorized by the parent or guardian in accordance with the Illinois Student Records Act (105 ILCS 10/1 et seq.).

Specifically, section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. Please note that all other records are being withheld entirely pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(f) at this time as factual information inextricably intertwined in ongoing investigation and processes as well as 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(n), which exempts from release records relating to the adjudication of employee discipline and grievance matters except for records reflecting the final outcome. \r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(d)(ii) records in the possession of any public body created in the course of administrative enforcement proceedings, and any law enforcement or correctional agency for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that disclosure would interfere with active administrative enforcement proceedings conducted by the public body that is the recipient of the request. \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).
