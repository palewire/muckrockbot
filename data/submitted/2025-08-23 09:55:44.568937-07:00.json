According to news reports, he had been detailed to multiple agencies in the service of DOGE's activities. I would like to request any SF-50/hiring docs from GSA, including if his position was converted to a different role (or moved from a volunteer to a pay position).\r\n- Jeremy Lewin was hired on or around January 20th. Since then, he has been detailed to several agencies, including USAID and CFPB and has been appointed to positions within both USAID and the Department of State. Nevertheless,  a news report on July 11th indicated that Lewin was still listed in the GSA directory as an employee. Is he still technically an employee of the agency. Is he still detailed to other agencies? He continues to be employed in the federal government.\r\n\r\nI would like to request the SF-50s and other onboarding / offboarding details for these two individuals. If possible, I would also like to request any relevant detailing arrangements for these individuals to other agencies by the GSA (or possibly even back to the GSA from other agencies if Jeremy Lewin's employment has ended at GSA but he has been detailed back from USAID or State).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Harris",

This request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. We request a waiver of any fees or costs associated with this request.\r\n\r\nThis request concerns a matter of public interest. It is important that we access these public records in order to effectively advocate for students and staff at the {agency name}. The records are not sought for a commercial or personal interest, but rather for the purpose of providing the public with information concerning civil liberties in higher education. \r\n\r\nIf you elect to charge a fee, please provide a cost estimate for each category of documents requested. Please also provide me with a W-9 form.\r\n\r\nRequest for expedited processing: The records pertain to a matter of public importance and current debate. Providing expedited production of the records will facilitate the public understanding of these matters before they are fully resolved. Any undue delay in production will undermine the purpose of the public records laws, which serve to allow public input and oversight of government affairs. In any event, {short name} law requires that a request be acted upon in {days} days.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if any specific categories of requested records will require a significantly longer production time than those in other categories, please provide records for each category on a piecemeal basis as they become available. \r\n\r\nRequest for Privilege Log: If any otherwise responsive documents are withheld on the basis that they are privileged or fall within a statutory exemption, please provide a privilege log setting forth (1) the subject matter of the document; (2) the person(s) who sent and received the document; (3) the date the document was created or sent; and (4) the basis on which the document is withheld.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nIf I can be of assistance in interpreting or narrowing this request, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n{name}\r\n\r\nCharlotte Arneson\r\nProgram Counsel, Campus Rights Advocacy \r\nFoundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE)\r\n700 Pennsylvania Avenue, Southeast, Suite 340\r\nWashington, D.C. 20003\r\nPh: 215-717-3473 ext. 263\r\nthefire.org",
