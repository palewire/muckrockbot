Requests for Additional Staff or Resources: Formal requests made by the department or Records Access Officer for additional staffing or resources to handle FOIL requests, including responses to these requests, from January 1, 2019, to present.\r\n\r\n5.

Performance Reviews or Evaluations: Performance reviews or evaluations of the Records Access Officer and staff responsible for handling FOIL requests.\r\n\r\n8.

Several requests, including inquiries about district communications, policies, and administrative records, have remained pending or under appeal for extended periods, with the district frequently citing staffing issues and the volume of requests as reasons for delay. This pattern raises serious concerns about whether the district is intentionally avoiding responses or failing to manage staffing effectively to meet its regulatory and legal obligations under FOIL. Given this context, there is a compelling need for expedited processing of this FOIL request to ensure transparency and accountability in the district's handling of public information requests.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

My request is for a fully unredacted version of this document.  \r\n\r\nA redact version of this document is accessible from the CIA's FOIA Reading Room: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0005403091.pdf\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that every single Georgian political figure mentioned in this document: Jaba Ioseliani, Tengiz Kitovani, Tengiz Sigua, Eduard Shevardnadze, Giorgi Chanturia, have all now passed away. The history of the early years of independence of Georgia is of ongoing interest to the public, and release of the requested document would further the American and Georgian public's understanding of contemporary observations of this time. In addition, I ask that this request be expedited, considering the historical importance of the document in question, and due to the fact that all the individuals mentioned in said document are now deceased. \r\n\r\nThank you for the CIA's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working towards the granting of this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
