        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nthe same information as provided in NLRB-2023-001998, but with current data. To quote:\r\n\r\n> I'm working on FOIA request NLRB-2023-001998 for \"all non-exempt fields of the participant and participant_party tables from the NxGen case management system database.\"\r\n> \r\n> NxGen designates participants to have one of four roles:\r\n> \r\n> * Primary: This is usually the main address of the facility as designated on the charge or petition\r\n> * Legal Rep: Legal representation for the primary participant\r\n> * Additional Service: These are people who would be like a cc in letters, or it could be a secondary address for someone. For example: many union reps list their official business address as primary, and because they might be located in a remote area or working from home, they have a secondary address or home address listed as an additional service.\r\n> * Notification: This are the national or international union headquarters. To become a notification, the organization has to file Form 4702 annually, and the notification party only receives a copy of the charge or petition.\r\n> \r\n> Participants also have distinct roles: Employer, Union, Individual, and Union as an Employer.\r\n> \r\n> NxGen further designates participants as: Charging Party, Charged Party/Respondent, Involved Party, Petitioner, Intervenor, Employer, and Amicus.\r\n> \r\n> Instead of providing a dump of all the participants in the system, and in order to provide the most relevant case information, my recommendation for participants is to provide the Primary participant information (entity name and address) and exclude the Legal Reps, Additional Services, and Notifications. Also, because the participant tables do not contain any other case-specific information besides the case number, I would recommend including the case name, date filed, date closed, and case closing reason. I also recommend information for individual charging parties/petitioners be listed simply as the party type of \"Individual\" and to exclude individuals' personal address information from your request (we would withheld it per Exemptions 6 and 7(C) if it's not specifically excluded.) Further, I would also recommend excluding Amicus information since cases can only have Amicus filings if the Board approves it.\r\n> \r\n> Sample R case info:\r\n> Case Number\r\n> Case Name\r\n> Case Filed Date\r\n> Case Closed Date\r\n> Closed Reason\r\n> Dispute/Unit State\r\n> Dispute/Unit City\r\n> Employer Type\r\n> Employer Account Name\r\n> Employer Address1\r\n> Employer Address Address2\r\n> Employer Address City\r\n> Employer Address State\r\n> Employer Address Zipcode\r\n> Petitioner Party Type\r\n> Petitioner\r\n> Petitioner Address1\r\n> Petitioner Address2\r\n> Petitioner Address City\r\n> Petitioner Address State\r\n> Petitioner Address Zipcode\r\n> Union Involved Party Type\r\n> Union Involved\r\n> Union Involved Address1\r\n> Union Involved Address2\r\n> Union Involved City\r\n> Union Involved State\r\n> Union Involved Zipcode\r\n> 09-RC-324532\r\n> Dunkin' Donuts\r\n> 08/25/2023\r\n> \r\n> OH\r\n> Cincinnati\r\n> Employer\r\n> Dunkin' Donuts\r\n> 850 Eastgate North Drive\r\n> \r\n> Cincinnati\r\n> OH\r\n> 45245\r\n> Union\r\n> Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, Local 57, AFL-CIO, CLC\r\n> 871 West Marion Road, Suite 202\r\n> \r\n> Mt.
