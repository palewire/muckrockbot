For the purpose of this FOIA request, we are concerned with the following 9 documents:\r\n\r\n1. Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan (2012)\r\n- Previously accessible at <https://www.archives.gov/about/plans-reports/strategic-plan/diversity-inclusion>\r\n2. DEIA Strategic Plan (2022-2026)\r\n- Previously accessible at <https://www.archives.gov/about/plans-reports/strategic-plan/diversity-inclusion>\r\n3. Diversity Policy Statement\r\n- Previously accessible at <https://www.archives.gov/eeo/policy/diversity-program>\r\n4. Diversity and Inclusion Policy Statement\r\n- Previously accessible at <https://www.archives.gov/eeo/policy/diversity-inclusion-policy-statement>\r\n5. National Archives' Agency Equity Action Plan\r\n- Previously accessible at <https://www.archives.gov/about/plans-reports/equity>\r\n6. Archivist\u2019s Task Force on Racism Report\r\n- Previously accessible at <https://www.archives.gov/news/topics/recommendations-from-internal-task-force-on-racism>\r\n6. NARA\u2019s Statement on Potentially Harmful Content\r\n- Previously accessible at <https://www.archives.gov/research/reparative-description/harmful-content>\r\n7. Guiding Principles for Reparative Description\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n- Previously accessible at <https://www.archives.gov/research/reparative-description-principles>\r\n8. Anti-Harassment Policy\r\n- Previously accessible at <https://www.archives.gov/eeo/policy/harassment-policy>\r\n9. Affirmative Employment Program (AEP) Plan\r\n- Previously accessible at <https://www.archives.gov/eeo/policy/affirmative-employment-program>\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. A copy of each of these nine policies, plans, reports, or official statements listed above.\r\n2. For each, if it was subsequently modified or reissued, a copy of all historical and current versions.\r\n3. For each, if it was subsequently rescinded or modified, any official memo (such as a NARA Notice) or communication (internal or external), wherein this update was announced.\r\n4. For each, if it was subsequently rescinded or modified without being so memorialized, a copy of the email, meeting minutes, or other document where the Archivist, Acting Archivist, or other relevant NARA official formalized the decision to rescind or modify. In the absence of that copy of any communication from the General Counsel (or general counsel staff) relating that it was effectively invalidated or altered by an Executive Order or other administration policy would also suffice.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of any charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDarren Barton-McDougall",
