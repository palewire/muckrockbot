Mr. Driver was born in Fontana, California. He served in the U.S. Marines Corps from 2001 to 2004 and achieved the rank of lance corporal. The requested records include performance reports, job assessments, disciplinary records, training received, discharge papers, and any other releasable records.\r\n\r\nI originally submitted this request to the National Personnel Records Center, which ordinarily handles these requests, but they claimed that they could locate no records for Mr. Driver. They forwarded the request to the Marines, who administratively closed my request after I did not respond to a denial letter (that I never personally received until after the closure) of my waiver of fees request. This is why I am sending the request directly to this office.\r\n\r\nThe public interest in Mr. Driver, an Academy Award-nominated film actor , should favor disclosure of many of these records, particularly in relation to any disciplinary records, should those records exist.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to review and release any segregable information, even if certain documents or portions of documents are withheld.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not a next of kin of this servicemember, and thus do not know Mr. Driver\u2019s Social Security Number. Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s relevant provisions. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Expedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nThe undersigned publishes a newsletter in anatoledo.substack.com and X articles under the handle @anatoledodavila. She currently has over 7,000 subscribers in both platforms and over 40,000 views per month. Pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466, she qualifies as a member of the news media that provides information of public interest to her subscribers. Thus the information sought is not deemed for commercial use. Id. Her status as a member of the media warrants the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed in the endeavors of disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5 (d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nThe records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity.\u201d Id.\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, the undersigned requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nIV. Request for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nThe undersigned hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2). Furthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as the undersigned will report the results of this endeavor as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, I request that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F. 2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). \r\n\r\nThe Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 832-247-3046. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nAna L. Toledo, Esq.\t\r\nanaluda@proton.me\r\nT. 832-24-3047\r\nPO Box 15990\r\nHouston, TX 77220\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

While participating remotely by phone, Ms. Adams stated:\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me just start by saying a real big thank you to our staff and our administration\u2026 last week we had a little bit more excitement in one week than we would like to have at the school\u2026 In this world of communication right now we need to remember that information will be dispelled as it\u2019s necessary and available, and that doesn\u2019t always mean, you know, right this second.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis statement appears to acknowledge a deliberate delay in communication with families regarding a specific incident or emergency. Notably, no other board member acknowledged the comment, and no one else referred to the incident at any point during the meeting. The session continued without clarification, follow-up, or public discussion\u2014despite the implications of the remark.\r\n\r\nFor reference, I am including a brief excerpt from the publicly available recording of the meeting:\r\nhttps://archive.org/download/spusd_02-11-2025/spusd_02-11-2025.mp4\r\n\r\nThe clip has been lightly zoomed to highlight board member reactions at the moment the comment was made. The fact that a board member raised a potentially serious issue\u2014publicly, on record\u2014and was met with complete silence, including from colleagues physically present in the room, is relevant context for this request.\r\n\r\nThis statement\u2014and the collective non-response that followed\u2014raises serious questions about what was known internally, when key decisions were made, and how communication with the public was managed at both the administrative and board level.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Rochford",
