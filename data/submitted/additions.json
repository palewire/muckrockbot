President Bush confirmed that Prigozhin acted as a waiter during a July 14th, 2006 dinner shared by the First Lady and the President and there are photos on the internet which imply there was a photo opportunity during the dinner. \r\n\r\nSee articles such as:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/george-bush-yevgeny-prigozhin-vladimir-putin-dinner-g8-ukraine-war-2023-9\r\n\r\nOf particular interest would be Prigozhin and either George or Laura Bush in the same photograph together.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
