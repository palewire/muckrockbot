NARA Open FOIA Requests and Appeals FY 2023\r\n\r\n***This Request will be timely for Judicial Review in twenty working days***\r\n\r\nI am submitting this request under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., as amended. If you deny all or any part of this request, please cite each specific exemption you think justifies your decision not to release the information and notify me of appeal procedures available under the law. References cited below apply.\r\n\r\nRECORDS SOUGHT VIA FOIA.\r\n\r\nExpedited FOIA Request NARA 24-A.D.MUCK. NARA Open FOIA Requests and Appeals FY 2023. See PDF.\r\n\r\n1.\tFOIA logs or logs by any other name containing records of all FOIA requests and appeals that were received or remained open from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 (FY 2023).\r\na.\tI am seeking logs in MS Excel format if available.\r\nb.\tThe data may be contained in one contiguous log or a combination of logs for prior fiscal years. Nevertheless, I am seeking all data.\r\n2.\tData that I am seeking for each FOIA request or appeal, which is in the Agency\u2019s custody, includes:\r\na. Tracking number of the request (unique individualized FOIA tracking number).\r\nb. Date of the request. \r\nc. Name of the requester, provided it is not a first-party requester (i.e., someone asking for records on himself or herself) \r\nd. Organizational affiliation of the requester, if identified in the request. \r\ne. Subject matter of the request. f. Status of the request (pending, closed, etc.). \r\ng. Date the request was perfected. \r\nh. The result of each FOIA request (granted, granted in part, denied, withdrawn, etc.).\r\ni. Exemptions cited, if any. \r\nj. Date on which the request was resolved. \r\nk. Fee category assigned to requester (commercial, educational, news media, other). \r\nl. Whether a fee waiver was requested. \r\nm. If a fee waiver was requested, whether it was granted. \r\nn. Fees charged to the requester, if any. \r\no. Whether the request was processed under the Privacy Act as well. \r\np. Whether expedited processing was requested.\r\nq. Whether expedited processing was granted.\r\n\r\n3.\tNote that past \u201cFOIA Logs\u201d posted to NARA\u2019s website do not contain all this data. NARA has other records responsive to my FOIA request. \r\n\r\n4.\tNote that past \u201cFOIA Logs\u201d posted to NARA\u2019s website only identify FOIA requests and appeals received during the current fiscal year and do not account for prior year requests and appeals that may have been completed during a subsequent fiscal year or remain open.\r\n\r\n5.\tThe Archivist of the United States approved two FOIA Advisory Committee recommendations regarding contemporaneous FOIA Logs, such that NARA is in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act in not following the recommendations approved by the Archivist. \r\n\r\n6.\tPer my many written Public Comments, NARA has been submitting massively false quarterly FOA reports (or not submitting data at all) and massively false annual FOIA reports. Information is urgently needed to assess the accuracy of NARA\u2019s FY 2023 annual FOIA report and raw data, which NARA submitted to DOJ OIP in December 2023, before that data is finalized into another materially false FOIA report. See my request for expedited processing.\r\n\r\n7.\tThe Agency copy of this FOIA Request this FOIA request itself is an agency record, \u201creceived by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied). \r\n\r\n\tThe definition of \u201crecords\u201d includes:\r\n\u201c[A]ill books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of data in them.\u201d  44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT.\r\n\r\nThe Webex recording link should also be included in the FOIA Advisory Committee meeting minutes. Public disclosure was an important issue at this meeting. There is no basis for not expeditiously providing the recording to the public \u2013 release to one, release to all.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number, and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee.\r\n\r\nThe OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat.\r\n2477 .)\r\n\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING.\r\n\r\nI certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that a compelling need exists for expedited processing as discussed below:\r\n\r\n1.\tRecords are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\na.\tNARA\u2019s alleged past massive false FOIA reporting is great public interest.\r\nb.\tThe Archivist of the United States approved two FOIA Advisory Committee recommendations regarding contemporaneous FOIA Logs, such that NARA is in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act in not following the recommendations approved by the Archivist. \r\nc.\tPer my many written Public Comments, NARA has been submitting massively false quarterly FOA reports (or not submitting data at all) and massively false annual FOIA reports. Information is urgently needed to assess the accuracy of NARA\u2019s FY 2023 annual FOIA report and raw data, which NARA submitted to DOJ OIP in December 2023, before that data is finalized into another materially false FOIA report. See my request for expedited processing.\r\n2.\tAdditionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOIA meeting.

This strict adherence is necessary to provide uniformity in the implementation of the DoD FOIA Program and to create conditions that will promote public trust.\u201d\r\n\r\nESTIMATED COMPLETION DATES\r\n\r\nProvide me with the initial estimated completion date (ESD) for this matter along with contemporaneous adjusted ESDs as they change.

This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n\r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office.\r\nThere are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default.\r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request, and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later.\r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. In any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues.\r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate, and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter. No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted, or fragmented data. Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).\r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift, or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n\r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n\r\nAPPLICABLE RETENTION SCHEDULE, NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n\r\n020\tAccess and disclosure request files.

I seek records via email in PDF format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done. \r\n\r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format. Emails should be provided as MS Outlook files, if not encrypted or otherwise unable to be opened by me. Only if this is not possible, emails should be produced with their embedded hyperlinked attachments by using the \u201cFile => Save as Adobe PDF\u201d command within Outlook or by other software that produces the same result.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other.

Records are located at https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/nara-24-cmuck-nara-open-foia-requests-and-appeals-fy-2023-157540/\r\n\r\nFPL dispute resolution is not optional \u2013 it is mandatory per the FOIA statute- as a non-exclusive alternative to other redress. NARA must engage in the disputes that I identify and not defer to previous determinations as definitive.\r\n\r\nI am seeking that NARA address every element and sub-element of my request for expedited processing. NARA must address all elements and to deny expedited processing NARA must reject every element/sub-element.\r\n\r\nNARA\u2019s generalized statement, \u201cAfter carefully reviewing your request, we do not believe expedition is warranted, as you have not demonstrated that your request meets the above-referenced criteria\u201d does not comport with law.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARA Unlawful Expedited Processing Pattern or Practice. NARA has the worst FOIA statistics in the federal government. NARA did not PROCESS any requests for expedited processing in FY 2022 despite claiming to have granted 58 and denied 329. NARA does not show any pending expedited processing requests in queue for FY 2022.  nara-fy22.pdf (archives.gov) https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/nara-fy22.pdf \r\nVII.A.\r\nVII.B.\r\nVII.C.\r\nVII.D.\r\nVIII.A.\r\na.\tThere is both internal inconsistency in NARA\u2019s FY 2022 data and inconsistency with its FY 2021 Annual FOIA report. https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/reports/nara-fy21-final.pdf \r\nb.\tNARA failed miserably in its last FOIA audit in 2017, including submitting massively false/unreliable FOIA reports. Things have gotten much worse. https://www.archives.gov/files/oig/reports/audit-report-17-AUD-16.pdf \r\nc.\tNARA\u2019s quarterly and Annual FOIA Reports are massively false based on written public comments that I have posted.\r\nd.\tNARA cannot again submit for FY 2023 a materially false Annual FOIA report, nor can DOJ OIP accept such a knowingly false annual FOIA report based on written public comments alone. (See public comments list attached.).\r\ne.\tA NARA OIG audit of FOIA funding and compliance is needed.\r\n\r\nWith my respect,\r\n\r\nRobert (Bob) Hammond\r\nPrivate Citizen FOIA Advocate\r\n",

It is not, however, a mechanism for posing and receiving answers to written questions.  As stated in FOIL Advisory Opinion 16632a<https://docsopengovernment.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f16632a.htm>, issued by the New York State Committee on Open Government:  \u201cVery simply, there is nothing in the Freedom of Information Law or the Open Meetings Law that requires that government officers or employees respond to questions, supply information in response to questions or offer explanations for their governmental activities.\u201d  Furthermore, as explained in FOIL Advisory Opinion 18795<https://docsopengovernment.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f18795.html>, \u201can agency need not create a record in response to a request for information.\u201d  Therefore, to the extent that the College does not maintain records which may be responsive to several of the questions listed below (i.e., average tenure, current turnover rate, how frequently are job description updated), the FOIL statute does not require to a public agency to create records in order to respond to a FOIL request.\r\n\r\nNote that once responsive records \u2013 i.e., the College\u2019s payroll and collective bargaining agreements -  are gathered in response to this FOIL request, they may contain answers to some the questions posed below (i.e., how are salaries adjusted, date compensation plan(s) were implemented, do you compensate faculty differently based on the area of discipline, etc.).  However, the answers will be able to be retrieved from a review of the relevant collective bargaining agreements.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlla Brodsky, Esq.\r\nDeputy General Counsel\r\nSuffolk County Community College\r\nAmmerman Campus\r\nEmail: brodskya@sunysuffolk.edu<mailto:brodskya@sunysuffolk.edu>\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL\r\nATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION/ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT\r\nINTER-OFFICE/INTRA-AGENCY COMMUNICATION\r\nNOT SUBJECT TO FOIL DISCLOSURE/NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION",

The College does not maintain an electronic database of job descriptions.\r\nIf you refer to the Active Employee Report I shared with you on April 10th, 2025, for all employees listed which are in the Association of Municipal Employees (\"AME\") Bargaining Unit, the job descriptions for each employee's title are set by the County of Suffolk Civil Service Department, and are available through the Civil Service Website.  Please refer to the following website:  Listing of all Job Titles (suffolkcountyny.gov)<https://apps2.suffolkcountyny.gov/civilservice/civilserviceinquiry/AllTitlesAction.aspx>.  For each AME employee, if you do a search for their \"Department Title\" on this webpage, as it appears on the spreadsheet shared with you (i.e., \"Senior Office Assistant\", \"College Aide\", \"Laborer\"), you will be able to access the job description.\r\n\r\nJob descriptions for College's Exempt Administrators have been uploaded for you, and are accessible through the following link:  Job Descriptions<https://sunysuffolk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/brodskya_sunysuffolk_edu/EmwIA1PESKFKgYYuwMt2SFgB_N6K4Snm2pBDHZ5xoLsVEA?e=j0aqUG>.\r\n\r\nAs far as job descriptions for remaining College employees, those who belong to the Guild and the Faculty Association bargaining units, the College do not maintain job descriptions database.  If you can specify which employees' job descriptions specifically you are looking for, from the list of employees provided to you, we can attempt to locate and retrieve the particular job description.

The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Please task a search that would yield UAP drone reports where the operator and origin has not been identified.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your timely cooperation and response. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 C.F.R 5.5(e), I respectfully request expedited processing. I provide the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746, declaring that they are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n\r\n1. Recent reports of UAP have created a subject of exceptional and widespread media interest about which there exists questions regarding the government\u2019s conduct..\r\nSee, e.g., and sources cited in paragraphs below.\r\n A. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/drone-sightings-spread-new-jersey-officials-express-outrage-federal-re-rcna184107 \r\n B. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drones-new-jersey-what-we-know/\r\n C. https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/us/new-jersey-drone-sightings/index.html\r\n D. https://apnews.com/article/fbi-drones-new-jersey-0f4aba00748ac464d42270fbe7457733\r\n E.  https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-we-know-about-the-mysterious-drones-flying-over-new-jersey\r\n F. https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/12/11/unexplained-reports-of-drones-flying-over-new-york-new-jersey-and-pennsylvania-heres-what-we-know/\r\n\r\n2. Beginning on or around November 18, 2024, multiple reports of UAP over the skies of New Jersey began to pour in. \r\n\r\n3. The UAP sightings occurred above one of the homes of the President-elect, and highly sensitive U.S. military installations, including the Picatinny Arsenal (see https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/decommissioning/complex/picatinny-arsenal.html). \r\n\r\n4. DHS is reportedly assisting in the federal coordination of the government\u2019s response to these UAP reports. https://defensescoop.com/2024/12/12/new-jersey-unidentified-drones-dod-poised-to-respond-if-threaten-military-assets/; https://apnews.com/article/fbi-drones-new-jersey-a978470fa3bb07ed3e98c5b7c18f0abb\r\n\r\n5. On December 13, DHS and FBI released a joint statement regarding this response: https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/12/12/joint-dhsfbi-statement-reports-drones-new-jersey. https://www.insidegovernmentcontracts.com/2024/01/implications-of-the-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-uap-amendment-in-the-2024-national-defense-authorization-act-ndaa/ \r\n\r\n6. To date, despite abundant video evidence, official confirmation from law enforcement and state officials, and federal lawmakers\u2019 questions, the government is unable to identify the origin, operator, or technological nature of the phenomena. https://www.npr.org/2024/12/11/nx-s1-5226000/new-jersey-drones.\r\n \r\n7. Instead, senior White House officials appear to dispute what people, including law enforcement officers, are witnessing and recording. https://www.twz.com/air/white-house-says-none-of-the-new-jersey-visual-drone-sightings-have-been-corroborated. \r\n\r\n8. Congress has held briefings on these phenomena; they produced no definitive answers from the U.S. government. https://ktxs.com/news/nation-world/pentagon-officials-hold-classified-briefing-with-congressn-uaps-ufos-new-jersey-sightings-drones-police-fbi-faa-regulations-bedminster-donald-trump-military-sites; https://thenationaldesk.com/news/americas-news-now/pentagon-officials-hold-classified-briefing-with-congressn-uaps-ufos-new-jersey-sightings-drones-police-fbi-faa-regulations-bedminster-donald-trump-military-sites\r\n\r\n9. In the absence of definitive, public assessments, elected officials are considering a limited declaration of emergency: https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/12/10/New-Jersey-Jon-Bramnick-drones-UAP-UFO-limited-emergency/9881733858673/. \r\n\r\n10.  Congress previously required collection of UAP records by no later than February 2024 in sections 1841-43of the FY23 National Defense Authorization Act\u2019s adaptation of the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023. https://www.insidegovernmentcontracts.com/2024/01/implications-of-the-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-uap-amendment-in-the-2024-national-defense-authorization-act-ndaa/.  \r\n\r\n11. The White House has declared the sightings are not attributable to a foreign nation. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/13/drones-over-new-jersey-white-house-lawmakers/76956011007/. \r\n\r\n12. Government officials, including DOD\u2019s Susan Gough, have stated that the UAP activity is not attributable to a U.S. research program. \r\n\r\n13. At least one U.S. Senator has called for U.S. military assets to shoot down these UAP, notwithstanding the publicly stated position of federal and state officials that they are not hostile, not experimental, and not identified. https://abc7ny.com/post/new-jersey-drones-us-senator-says-mystery-devices-spotted-nj-should-shot-down-necessary/15647143/. \r\n\r\n14. True to form, New Jersey residents have also suggested taking matters into their own hands and shooting down the phenomena as well. https://www.foxnews.com/us/drones-mystery-new-jersey-homeowners-threaten-take-matters-own-hands-govt-doesnt-act.\r\n\r\n15. In the absence of clear, consistent communications from U.S. officials, heightened tensions regarding the inability or unwillingness of the government to explain what is happening above the skies of New Jersey, there is an increasing risk to the health and safety of people who are making the reports and capturing the video images of whoever or whatever is visiting the Garden State.\r\n\r\n16. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
