Specifically, I am requesting data related to the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Lack of access to quality education due to underfunding of schools in low-income areas\r\n2. Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or other factors\r\n3. Limited opportunities for career and personal advancement for individuals from certain backgrounds\r\n4. Lack of representation and visibility of diverse perspectives in curriculum and teaching materials\r\n5. Implicit biases held by teachers, administrators, and other education professionals that impact student experiences and outcomes\r\n6. Inadequate support for students with disabilities or learning differences\r\n7. Language barriers for students and families who speak languages other than English\r\n8. Insufficient engagement with families and communities, especially those who have historically been marginalized\r\n9. Limited access to technology and internet connectivity for students from low-income families\r\n\r\nI would like the data to include any assumptions or judgments made in the Culturally Responsive-Sustaining Education Framework for which the statistical tabulations and data should support.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",
