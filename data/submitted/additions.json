I am looking for for records relating to a 911 call and dispatch made on August 11 2023.  \r\n\r\nAccording to news reports, a 3-year-old child riding one of Texas\u2019 migrant buses died while on the way to Chicago, officials said Friday. The Illinois Department of Public Health said the child was 3 years old and died Thursday in Marion County. \r\n\r\nThe Texas Division of Emergency Management said in a statement that, \u201cOnce the child presented with health concerns, the bus pulled over and security personnel on board called 9-1-1 for emergency attention.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am looking for the recording of this 911 call for service as well as any incident report and dispatch log relating to the event.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",
