The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the CPRA. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The CPRA does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the CPRA recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the CPRA or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Department has completed its review and is providing you with records responsive to your request.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPlease note that under Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \u201cpublic records\u201d includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public\u2019s business and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities. Similarly, Sections 7927.700 and 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest. Therefore, responsive records containing personal information are being provided to you with redactions.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.civicplus.help/nextrequest/docs/requesters\">help page</a>",

Your request is governed by the Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cPIA\u201d), Maryland Code, General Provisions Article (\u201cGP\u201d), Sections 4-101 et seq. DCU will attempt to process your request promptly. However, our response may take longer than ten (10) working days, the reasons for which may include the scope of your request, the type and volume of potentially responsive records, and the nature of the search, review, and preparation that is required. DCU will contact you with the availability of records and the possible costs associated with this request, as soon as the information is made available by the Custodian of Records. Likewise, if the DCU and/or the Custodian of Records need you to clarify your request, DCU will than contact.\r\nYour request seeks Public Integrity Bureau\u2019s (PIB) administrative disciplinary records recently made disclosable pursuant to Anton\u2019s Law, S.B. 178 (2021 Session). Although we have not yet investigated the scope of your particular request, production of these records often involves expenditure of substantial resources in the search for, preparation of, and reproduction of responsive materials.\r\nBPD will offer requestors of such records the option to receive the disciplinary history summary for each BPD member identified in the request in lieu of a comprehensive response to the request. These summaries provide an overview of all disciplinary investigations against the subject officer including the disposition of each, can be prepared more quickly than a full disciplinary file, and can be produced at little or no cost to the requestor. The summary may provide all of the information you seek, or may enable you to resubmit a more tailored request, thereby reducing the fee BPD charges to recover its costs in producing the materials you require.\r\nPlease respond to this email within 10 business days indicating whether you wish to receive disciplinary history summaries in lieu of your request as originally stated. This information is required for DCU to move forward with either 1) preparing an estimate of the cost associated with the production of the disciplinary history summary or 2) preparing an estimate of the costs associated with the production of records responsive to the full scope of your request. No further action will be taken by DCU until we receive your response. Please refer to tracking # MPIA 25-1346 in any subsequent correspondence pertaining to this matter.

Except as expressly noted below, it is the City\u2019s intent to cooperate with you in identifying any records that would be responsive to your request, and to expeditiously provide you with those records. \r\n\r\nHowever, as you may be aware, under California Law, a request for documents must reasonably describe an identifiable record, and must be focused and specific. (See Cal. Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.530(a); Rogers v. Superior Court, 19 Cal.App.4th 469, 481.) Likewise, cities are not required to create a new record in response to a request. (See Haynie v. Superior Court, 26 Cal.4th 1061, 1075.) Nevertheless, the City will use its best efforts to identify all records that may be responsive to your requests. \r\n\r\nDue to the time required to search, compile, and review potentially responsive documents, I am requesting an additional 14 days from the date of this response to complete the process. If further time is needed, I will notify you accordingly. As of now, the anticipated response date is October 13, 2025. For\u00a0questions or additional information, please reply to this email.

All departmental or municipal policies regarding communication and information sharing between departmental officers or employees and federal agents/agencies within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including but not limited to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The records request includes, but is not limited to, policies regarding: \r\n\r\nA. Fingerprint and other data sharing, \r\n\r\nB. ICE detainer requests,   \r\n\r\nC. Compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including guidance or policies around when communication with ICE officers is allowed, and \r\n\r\nD. Communicating with federal immigration enforcement officers. \r\n\r\nThis request covers any policies that are currently in effect or that have been in effect at any point on or after January 20, 2025. \r\n\r\n2. The three most recent communications (e.g., emails, text messages, call logs or transcripts, or otherwise) between a departmental officer or employee and a federal DHS or ICE employee. In addition, I request all records related to these communications, including, but not limited to, any records indicating that the department was made aware of the communications, discussions of their content or implications, evaluations them for compliance with departmental or other city policies, identification or acknowledgement of any potential policy violations, and any internal responses, disciplinary actions, or follow-up measures resulting from these communications. \r\n\r\n3. All records relating to incidents, if any, from January 20, 2025, to the day this request is responded to, in which an individual was taken from the department\u2019s custody directly into ICE custody. For each incident, the records request includes, but is not limited to, booking and transfer records, communications with ICE or other federal agencies, internal documentation or discussion of the transfer, and internal notes, memos, or documentation referencing communication with DHS or ICE.\r\n\r\nFor each request, I am not seeking identifying information, and I will accept anonymized or redacted data as necessary to protect identities. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. I expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff \r\n\r\nJoshuadankoff@cfjj.org  \r\n\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives \r\n\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice  \r\n\r\n(submitted via MuckRock platform)",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to Florida's Public Records Law (Chapter 119, Florida Statutes), I submit the following records request:\r\n\r\nI would first and foremost like to thank your department for previous cooperation with my audit requests as I know that this requires additional time and effort from department personnel. However, my previous audit left some questions as to the department's use of Flock systems and safeguards that are in place to ensure the security and privacy of the residents of Okaloosa County. My intent is to gain insight into your department's use of the Flock system due to national concern of agencies overstepping 4th amendment rights and well documented misuse of this system by other agencies. If your department is truly using this system as advertised, then I would love nothing more than to share those facts with concrete evidence as I imagine that this information would help citizens, including myself, to feel more at ease with the use of this system around our homes and places of work. \r\n\r\n- Records Related to the Department's Flock Safety System:\r\n\r\n1. Financial Records:\r\n   1a. Any internal financial audits conducted regarding expenditures on the Flock Safety contract from inception to present\r\n   1b. If no formal internal audit exists, a written statement or documentation showing the approximate annual expenditure by the department on the Flock Safety contract\r\n   1c. The total contract value\r\n   1d. The contract renewal date or expiration date\r\n   1e. Any amendments to the original contract affecting financial terms\r\n\r\n2. Contract and Agreement Documents:\r\n   2a. The complete, executed contract(s) between the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Department and Flock Safety, including all terms and conditions\r\n   2b. Service level agreements\r\n   2c. Data sharing provisions and agreements with Flock Safety\r\n   2d. Privacy disclosure information and policies\r\n   2e. Data retention and deletion policies\r\n   2f. Third-party data access provisions\r\n   2g. All amendments, addendums, or modifications to the original contract\r\n\r\n3. Internal Use Policy and Accountability Measures:\r\n   3a. Policies regarding authorized users and permissible uses of the system\r\n   3b. Training requirements for deputies and other personnel\r\n   3c. Audit and oversight procedures\r\n   3d. Accountability measures for system misuse or unauthorized access\r\n   3e. Procedures for conducting searches and queries\r\n   3f. Legal justification requirements for searches (warrant requirements, reasonable suspicion standards, etc.)\r\n\r\n4. Security and Privacy Safeguards:\r\n   4a. Authentication requirements (e.g., two-factor authentication policies)\r\n   4b. Password policies, including requirements for length, complexity, and rotation\r\n   4c. Standards for regular user account access audits and reviews\r\n   4d. Cybersecurity vulnerability assessments or security reviews conducted on the Flock Safety system\r\n\r\n- Clarification Regarding Requested Records:\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I am requesting financial documents, contract documents, policy documents, and security documentation (of the administrative use of the Flock System) that document expenditures, contractual obligations, internal governance, and system security measures. The contracts, financial records, and policy documents requested are standard public records that document how public funds are spent and how government agencies operate, and do not contain information that would compromise law enforcement operations, ongoing investigations, or reveal investigative practices as these documents are administrative in nature.\r\n\r\n- Accommodation for Partial Exemptions:\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the requested records contains information that your department believes is exempt under Florida law, I respectfully request that you provide the records with appropriate redactions of only that specific exempt information, rather than withholding the records in their entirety. Florida's Public Records Law requires that exemptions be narrowly construed, and non-exempt portions of records must be disclosed even when some portions are exempt.\r\n\r\n- Additional Questions:\r\n\r\nHere are several questions that I would greatly appreciate responses to in addition to the above requested records:\r\n\r\n1. Is your department aware of the numerous security vulnerabilities that have been discovered by security researchers (such as the YouTube channel Benn Jordan: see this video; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB0gr7Fh6lY) to include antiquated operating system software, admin portals left open to web access with default credentials, and Flock accounts for sale on the dark web to name a few?\r\n\r\n2. I saw on your departments Facebook post, on the 12th of January 2026, that your department requires outside agencies to provide warrants and/or investigative reasoning for data regarding Okaloosa residents. In my audit of your logs I noticed several logs that indicated that searches were also being done on behalf of county investigators as well (specifically A. Planck). Are internal uses of the system for investigations into suspicious activities or on behalf of investigators also required to provide a warrant or other legal justification for searches conducted on the Flock system?\r\n\r\n3. What is your department's view on the case currently under review of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia regarding Flock cameras? To quote an article: \"Chief Judge Davis rejected the city\u2019s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, citing the United States Supreme Court case Carpenter v. United States, which held that using cell phone location data to track someone\u2019s movements is a search that requires a warrant under the Fourth Amendment. Chief Judge Davis wrote, \u201ca reasonable person could believe that society\u2019s expectations, as laid out by the Court in Carpenter, are being violated by the Norfolk Flock system.\u201d\".\r\n(citation: https://ij.org/press-release/judge-rules-lawsuit-challenging-norfolks-use-of-flock-cameras-can-proceed/)\r\n\r\n- Format and Delivery:\r\n\r\nPlease provide records in their original electronic, machine-readable format. For example, please provide PDF format for contracts and policy documents, and spreadsheet files where applicable for financial data. Please do not redirect me to your transparency portal.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment or Dropbox link.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as Florida law requires. If you believe any portion of the requested records is exempt, please provide a detailed explanation identifying the specific exemption and how it applies to the specific data withheld.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nKyle Searfoss",

Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide copies of all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Can we provide the total cost and software names for all software?\r\n3. Our attorney is on a retainer to perform lots of types of work for us.

Any/all records and writings regarding salary, benefits, and compensation of the Grandview School District Public Records Officer.\r\n\r\n2. Any/all records and writings regarding salary, benefits, and compensation of any individual performing Public Records Request functions on behalf of the Grandview School District.\r\n\r\n3.

Any/all records and writings referencing any invoices for any legal work (including consulting and representation) performed on behalf of the Grandview School District in response to public records requests and/or public records act litigation.\r\n\r\nDATE RANGE OF REQUEST\r\n\r\nThe date range for records responsive to this request is January 01, 2020 - October 01, 2024.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide copies of all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

        "communication": "This letter is in response to your public records request received by the Grandview School District. We are providing the Second installment, which includes records in response to Items #2 and #3 of your request. Those items seek:\r\n\r\n1)\tAny/all records and writings regarding salary, benefits, and compensation of any individual performing Public Records Request functions on behalf of the Grandview School District.\r\n2)\tAny/all records and writings referencing any software packages used in the search for and processing of Public Records Requests by the Grandview School District.\r\n\r\nWe were unable to locate any records responsive to #4 of your request. \r\n4)\tAny/all records and writings referencing any invoices for any legal work (including consulting and representation) performed on behalf of the Grandview School District in response to public records requests and/or public records act litigation.\r\n\r\nPer your request, you are seeking records for the period of January 01, 2020, through October 01, 2024.\r\n\r\nRegarding the records provided in response to item 2, similar to out interpretation of item 1, which we shared with you on November 5, 2025 in the District first installment, we have interpreted this request to be seeking a copy of the employment contracts and pay summaries of actual wages paid for the category of persons noted (\u201cany individual performing Public Records Request functions on behalf of the Grandview School District\u201d). Further, we have interpreted that category of persons just noted to mean: Grandview School District employee with a job responsibility of assisting the Grandview School District Public Records Officer with the identification of responsive public records and public records retrieval. For example, this would include the HR Specialist, whose job duties directly include assisting the PRO with tracking public records requests received by the District, but would exclude teachers, custodians, similarly situated staff who may, from time to time, be asked to search their personal files or emails for records responsive to a particular request, but who job duties do not regularly include public records activities. \r\n\r\nRegarding the records provided in response to item 3, we have interpreted this request to be seeking a copy of records that identify each of the software systems used by the District to search for and/or store records (that is, those software systems specifically purchased, contracted, or accessed for the purposes of complying with the District\u2019s records retention and public records responsibilities). Accordingly, please note that we do not interpret \u201csoftware packages used in the search for and processing of Public Records Requests\u201d to include any of the software that is routinely used to create individuals records (e.g., Microsoft Word, Adobe, district email systems used for the sending and receipt of email). Further, because we interpret your request to be seeking the identification of the above-described software packages, we are providing a copy of records of invoices paid and all service agreements and contracts for such software systems for the period in question to fulfill this request. One alternate interpretation of your request for \u201cany \u2026 records referencing any software packages used\u201d (emphasis added) would generate voluminous and duplicative records. For example, an email between two staff asking if one had observed whether an access feature in an identified software program was temporarily out-of-order could, under an alternative interpretation, be construed as a record \u201creferencing\u201d that software package. The District\u2019s interpretation will not yield these extraneous results. \r\n\r\nWe will require an additional 30 business days to create the next (expected final) installment of your request. The next installment will be provided on or before January 21st, 2026. \r\n\r\nRegarding the above, please notify us if we have mis-interpretated items 2 and 3 of your request.\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nJosie Chase \r\nHR Director \r\n5098828519\r\njachase@gsd200.org",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function.\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request.\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed.  If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data.\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set)\r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes\r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations?\r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses.\r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations\r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request.\r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored.\r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\").\r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example:\r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps.\r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings.\r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements\r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems.\r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement\r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding:\r\n- Placement location recommendations\r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement\r\n- Community concerns or opposition\r\n- Equity or privacy impacts\r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale\r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion.\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail)\r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.  Please include:\r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.\r\n- Date and time of access\r\n- Name and Job Title of User\r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query)\r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged\r\n2. Network Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests.\r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1.\r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to:\r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement\r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors\r\n- Surveillance technology policy\r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOmar Solis",

The search yielded the following results: ChatGPT \nTxDOT does not have a contract with ChatGPT and, so, the conversations will have to be pulled by the individual users if that user was logged in with a personal account. There was a total of 1,931 employees who used ChatGPT in the last 90 days and may be able to generate logs if they were using a personal account. TxDOT conducted a sample pull of one employee\u2019s conversations based on the parameters you provided. It took 15 min to pull the conversation and is estimated to take 483 hours in total to pull all of the conversations. CoPilot \nFor the past 90 days, a total of 15,807 users were discovered for CoPilot using TxDOT-issued devices. There were 4,761 TxDOT employee accounts who interacted with CoPilot, but only 4,527 TxDOT employee accounts had distinct conversations with CoPilot that could be pulled. This generated 136,664 distinct files that would require downloading and sanitization of HTML files so that they can be shared and viewable for the public. The remaining 11,000+ users either used a personal account or did not sign in at all, and TxDOT would need to conduct an agency-wide search to locate and produce this information by contacting every individual employee. \nTxDOT is able to provide the CloudAppEvents log, which will contain the interactions but not the actual prompts/responses, or general statistics of use without significant cost. However, if you still request the individual conversations TxDOT will proceed and will provide a cost estimate to produce these records. Based on the time it took to handle the ChatGPT log pull, TxDOT estimates 15-30 min per user to complete the task as written, but a sample pull will be done to finalize the estimate. Please confirm whether you want TxDOT to proceed with your request as written or if you wish to modify, narrow, or amend the request in any way to reduce the amount of information you have requested. \nIf you would like for TxDOT to proceed with your public information request, please provide clarifications within sixty-one (61) days from 11/18/2025. Otherwise, TxDOT will consider your request withdrawn. \nYou may provide a response to TxDOT by responding to this email. \nUpon receipt of your clarification, TxDOT will further respond to your Public Information Act Request as required by law, including providing you with an estimate of costs associated with producing the requested records. \nIf you have any questions, please reply to this email. Thank you for your attention to this matter. \nSincerely, \nJeffrey Hutson \n\nInformation Management \nTo monitor the progress or update this request please log into the TxDOT Records Request Center (https://u8387778.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.VEsWrlMiJDg0mXafq1mEXWtRp3aoWox5SVIqq7txaCtLZQ0y-2B7wlKD2RVwHHTlOtFi2DlIJlzxu0uDdx4osaTrB9v4XrdRLclxUUvsLUGrk-3D9zIX_zpBb0BT2bcGZXKgYNZjYBcbr6ZTkpVTLMl9wZaC2jNFNLoXjtIJHfb-2FucZAQGHjURs7RE0hIUuVJeplm18aV8Wd-2Fq7-2BYrL-2BsAdQE1qgmodkRZ2B6ixW7Li2jBNaAuGZGHD2yNcYsrp-2Fo3Mgbe-2FC-2FgpYQtuIL3OqdXaEFBiJ2Q-2Fi-2BJepqpOtQm2oNLVCqXmzx-2B2g7cyduNXLmhBPSnDCzWAHNzg6XAOWCwZkT-2Btdhx-2BAzbMFH2zpTgc8OEQiDx1k8JJjOVZFU3g-2BFmGDTjZQc5E5rimy5811F3r-2FBLKMT42QAYKG05QfDS7XJN5PA5AXWRwiD2ZdA-2Be5VoZkLj-2FQEwzjWlxTLiqfRJZTCyoLTnxjKpkgQo3Q-2B6SFYoZzufaoZ)\n",
