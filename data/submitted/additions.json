I\u2019d appreciate the total funds spent procuring Chromebooks, how many Chromebooks were procured, the expected lifecycle of these devices (i.e. how many years the devices are projected to be in use before refreshed with new models), any direct maintenance costs (i.e. funds spent on buying spare parts, paying for repairs, replacing chargers, buying management or security licenses), as well as any funds received for selling or recycling decommissioned Chromebooks.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLucas Rockett Gutterman",
