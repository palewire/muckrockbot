        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M.G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\u2022\tA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\u2022\tA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis request is for the calendar years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024, up to and including the day the records are produced. The scope of the request is the Mel H. King Academy South End Academy, formerly known as the McKinley schools, including all records for the following schools:\r\n\u2022\tElementary: 90 Warren Avenue, Boston, MA 02116.\r\n\u2022\tK-12 Academy: 90 Warren Avenue, Boston, MA 02116.\r\n\u2022\tMiddle: 50 St. Mary\u2019s Street, Boston, MA 02215.\r\n\u2022\tPrep: 97 Peterborough Street, Boston, MA 02115.\r\nThroughout this request, \u201cSchool\u201d refers to all of the schools described above. \u201cSchool-related arrest\u201d refers to \u201can arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the School and time period described above, I request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement. \r\n2.\tSpecifically, I request a database extract including the following variables:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges) including the statute governing the alleged offense \r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n3.\tIf a database extract as described in bullets 1\u20132 is not possible, please provide any existing police reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement. \r\n4.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from the School that were received by your department.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). Moreover, for municipalities with a population of over 20,000, the first two hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record may not be charged a fee. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M.G.L. c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. If you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-338-1050 or by email at averyfarmer@cfjj.org. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAvery Farmer\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",
