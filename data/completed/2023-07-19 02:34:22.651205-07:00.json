        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Daniel Bledsoe. As you probably recall, the FBI located approximately 1330 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFOIA Negotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nNeed a status check?

Big Local News is a program of Stanford University\u2019s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and helps journalists collect, process and analyze public data. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking any datasets, databases, and/or spreadsheets sufficient to show the following information regarding every current or former sworn employee of the Hawaii Department of Public Safety, year-by-year, dating back however far as the data exist for:\r\n\r\nFirst name\r\nMiddle name or initial\r\nLast name\r\nUnique employee identification number\r\nStar or badge number\r\nRace\r\nGender\r\nYear of birth\r\nRank\r\nTroop assignment\r\nUnit assignment\r\nDivision assignment (Patrol, Investigations, Support, etc.)\r\nHire date\r\nSeparation date, if applicable\r\nReason for separation, if applicable\r\n\r\nIf your certification/roster system contains data elements not listed above, please include them in the response, provided they are releasable under the law. On the other hand, we recognize some of the information we are asking for may not be tracked by your system. If that is the case, we are willing to accept as many of the data elements as your agency maintains. If some records are more readily available, we are happy to receive partial information as soon as possible while the remaining request is processed. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the data elements listed, we request documentation necessary to understand and interpret the data, including but not limited to record layouts, data dictionaries, code sheets, lookup tables, etc. \r\n\r\nOur preference is to receive structured data provided in a machine-readable text file, such as delimited or fixed-width formats. We can also handle a variety of other data formats including SQL databases, Excel workbooks and MS Access. If there are additional formats your agency would prefer to provide, please let us know. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking this information as a news media organization on a matter of public interest concerning the conduct of government. As such, we ask for a waiver of all fees, if allowed under state law. If fees are necessary to reimburse the agency for actual costs, we agree to pay up to $100. If costs exceed that amount, please let us know before fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease send clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time. Thank you very much for your time and attention to this request.\r\n\r\nSam Stecklow\r\nJournalist\r\nInvisible Institute",

Albert Fentress is a convicted criminal who gained notoriety for his involvement in the abduction, rape, and murder of a college student in Poughkeepsie in the late 1980s. Fentress was arrested, tried, and convicted for these heinous crimes, and his case has been a subject of public interest and scrutiny for several years.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there have been further allegations against Albert Fentress, including suspicions of involvement in other unsolved cases of a similar nature. These allegations have raised concerns within the community and have sparked discussions about the extent of Fentress's criminal activities. Therefore, I believe it is crucial to access the requested records to shed light on these allegations and provide a comprehensive understanding of the investigations conducted by the City of Poughkeepsie Police Department.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nArrest records and charging documents related to Albert Fentress.\r\nCourt records, including judgments, verdicts, and sentencing information.\r\nPolice reports, incident reports, and any other investigative documents related to Albert Fentress.\r\nCorrespondence and communications, including emails, letters, memoranda, or any other written exchanges mentioning or involving Albert Fentress.\r\nAny audio or visual recordings, such as interviews, interrogations, or surveillance footage related to Albert Fentress.\r\nAny internal memos, policies, or guidelines concerning the handling of Albert Fentress's case.\r\nGiven the profound impact of Albert Fentress's crimes on the community and the ongoing interest in understanding the scope of his criminal activities, accessing these records will contribute significantly to the public's understanding of the operations and activities of the City of Poughkeepsie Police Department.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I firmly believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure will greatly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\nPhone:845 218 0299\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request will be instantly published on the platform.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.",

The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process.For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.If you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.

Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm]. \r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants.

        "communication": "The Town of Haverstraw Mayor's Office\r\n1 Rosman Rd.\r\nGarnerville, NY 10923\r\n\r\nSeptember 10, 2020\r\n\r\nDear Mayor Michael Kohut:\r\n\r\nThis summer the Haverstraw Police Department was sent a request for records filed under New York\u2019s open records law (FOIL). Additionally, there have been five follow up requests for the information. To date, the Town of Haverstraw has been unresponsive, in direct conflict with state law. As you know, government agencies that do not respond may be subject to fines and/or court fees for failure to comply with a lawful request. \r\n\r\nUnder the possibility that the original request and follow ups were misdirected, we are repeating the request and broadening the recipients. Please respond within five days as the law allows: \r\n\r\nAll materials and records describing and sufficient to show/disclose all allegations of misconduct made and all disciplinary proceedings taken against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency.\r\nAs described in the New York Freedom of Information Law, a record is \"any information kept, held, filed, produced or reproduced by, with or for an agency or the state legislature, in any physical form whatsoever including, but not limited to, reports, statements, examinations, memoranda, opinions, folders, files, books, manuals, pamphlets, forms, papers, designs, drawings, maps, photos, letters, microfilms, computer tapes or discs, rules, regulations or codes.\" Records kept in a digital or electronic form are also records, would be responsive to this request, and should be provided.\r\nThese records are typically required to be retained under the New York State Records Retention and Disposition Schedule MU-1 (http://www.archives.nysed.gov/records/retention_mu-1), including, but not limited to, item no. 365, which includes: \"Investigative records and disciplinary proceedings, including but not limited to statement of charge, transcript of hearing, notice of decision, letter of termination or resignation, letter of reinstatement, record of appeal procedure, and correspondence.\" While materials under that schedule have a set retention of 3 years after the final decision rendered, this request and materials responsive to it include *all* records held in the possession of any office or individual employed or formerly employed by this policing agency, including those kept off-site, in digital form, and in personnel files.\r\nPlease note that any failure to provide all potentially-responsive materials and/or the destruction of materials potentially responsive to this request would be a violation of the spirit of the New York Freedom of Information Law, as well as unlawful under the New York FOIL and the terms of the attached litigation hold notice.\r\nMaterials responsive to this request include \u2014 but are not limited to \u2014 all complaints, reports, records of discipline and penalties, aggregate collections of complaint and disciplinary materials (spreadsheets, databases), investigatory materials, relevant related correspondence, photographs, video, other related evidence, proof of discipline or fulfillment of penalties, and all personnel materials (including those used in promotion, contract, and other employment negotiations and considerations) that reference or utilize misconduct allegations or disciplinary materials of any sort.\r\nMaterials responsive to this request include all complaints\u2014 internal, external, and civilian \u2014 and include records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident/complaint: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the investigation, investigatory materials, the disposition of the case, and any subsequent materials related to the execution of any resultant discipline. Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action.\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force.\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes:\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm].\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication.\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nThis request was initially submitted as part of a collaborative academic and journalistic research project conducted in the public interest. As part of this collaboration, multiple individuals may contact you from a number of partner organizations, including but not limited to MuckRock and Syracuse University, and other partner organizations may respond or request clarification regarding this request. It would be appreciated if all messages coming from the MuckRock address associated with this request be honored as a proper communication in our correspondence on this request.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAlyssa Hertel in collaboration with MuckRock, Syracuse University, and additional newsroom partners",

On 11/17/2022 a Supervisory Government Information Specialist in the VA OIG Release of Information Office named Ruthlee G. Bellamy Falsely Responded that VA OIG posessed none of the Requested Information as pertaining to VA OIG Michael J. Missal.\r\n\r\nOn 12/12/2022 US DVA FOIA Officer as well as Management and Program ANALYST Mark Littlefield Responded on behalf of US DVA with a total of 8 e-mail records pertaining to only two of the Request's identified subjects; namely VA Officers Chihung Szeto and Eugene Skinner.\r\n\r\nOn 12/28/2022 - a Government Informaiton Specialist in the VA Office of Inspector General Information Release Office named Ms. Johnson Responded with some to all requested Information Requested as pertains to VA OIG Michael Missal. While thankful for the provided Information Requested, the partial Response thoroughly proves that: a) VA OIG via Ruthlee G. Bellamy provided a False and / or otherwise improper \"Final Agency Response\" of \"Full Denial\" and b) given the Fact some of the Requested Information provided via Ms. Johnson contains such regarding Eugene Skinner and Chihung Szeto that is not in ANALYST Mark Littlefield's Response for such information; it's apparent Mr. Littlefield's account of the search for such Requested Information is False, erroneous or reliant upon False information directly provided by Eugene Skinner and Chihung Szeto.\r\n\r\nTo date none of the Requested Information regarding Mr.s Harris, Trinh, McDonough, Merchant, Braverman, MacGahran, Simms, Rychalski and VAPD has been provided; and in light of False, erroneous and / or misleading information so slowly provided in Response to this Request - there's evident concern for a lack of integrity and violation of Federal Public Law governing FOIA. I respectfully demand a diligent, full, complete, honest and lawful Response to my long overdue Request pertaining to Public Officials' Federal Advisory Committee records pertaining to the VCOEB within the Request's specified time period without further delay and apparent suppression of said Information which the U.S. Federal Government is mandated to provide.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRyan Thompson",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    A copy of file 62-24172, specifically including portions not on the FBI's\r\n    website. A release of only preprocessed materials will explicitly not be\r\n    sufficient.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nSB 1421 became law in January 2019 in the State of California. (https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1421) \r\n\r\nUnder it, records pertaining to certain kinds of police incidents are newly eligible for disclosure under CPRA. \r\n   \r\nI am making the following request for all sworn police officers with the agency. Attached is a roster of such sworn officers from 2018. If there are current additional sworn officers not included in this roster, please include those additional officers in this request. If there are officers included in the attached roster that are no longer with the agency, I request historical records for that officer. \r\n    \r\nI hereby request the following records for each agency officer at the agency: \r\n        1. Incidents involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace or custodial officer\r\n        b) Incidents in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a person resulted in death, or in great bodily injury\r\n        c)Any record(s) relating to any incident(s) in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged in sexual assault involving a member of the public.\r\n        d) Any record(s) relating to any incident(s) in which a sustained finding was made by any law enforcement agency or oversight agency of dishonesty by a peace officer or custodial officer directly relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct by, another peace officer or custodial officer, including, but not limited to, any sustained finding of perjury, false statements, filing false reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence.\r\n        e) any civilian complaint that isnot otherwise encapsulated by the aforementioned, and is not exempt from disclosure. \r\n This includes all of the following pertinent documents, as described in the statute:\r\n            photographic, audio, and video evidence; transcripts or recordings of interviews; autopsy reports; all materials compiled and presented for review to the district attorney or to any person or body charged with determining whether to file criminal charges against an officer in connection with an incident, or whether the officer\u2019s action was consistent with law and agency policy for purposes of discipline or administrative action, or what discipline to impose or corrective action to take; documents setting forth findings or recommended findings; and copies of disciplinary records relating to the incident, including any letters of intent to impose discipline, any documents reflecting modifications of discipline due to the Skelly or grievance process, and letters indicating final imposition of discipline or other documentation reflecting implementation of corrective action.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJPat Brown\n\n",

This is an opportunity to\r\nreview the project goals and ask any questions about the RFP. \r\n\r\nThe pre-proposal meeting will be held remotely over Zoom. Please follow\r\nthis Link\r\n\r\nto join the Zoom meeting.

This grant will help the\r\nCity to:\r\n\r\n* Develop regulations or procedures to expedite approvals for a\r\nsignificant portion of development proposals. This includes a separate,\r\nnon-discretionary permit review of projects that are consistent with the\r\nCity of Oakland's General Plan and Planning Code.\r\n\r\n* Prepare Objective Design Standards to streamline processing for a\r\nvariety of proposals, especially affordable housing and projects near\r\nBART and along major transit corridors.\r\n\r\nThe objective design standards will be applied broadly to projects\r\nconsisting of a wide array of building types throughout the City of\r\nOakland. Creation of the objective design standards for\r\nnon-housing-related projects will come from a separate funding source.\r\n\r\nThe desired consultant team will include one or more multi-disciplinary\r\nplanning and design firm(s) with expertise in the following areas:\r\ndeveloping objective design standards in ethnically, linguistically and\r\nculturally diverse communities; creating programs and processes that\r\nexpedite project review; practicing historic preservation planning; and\r\nengaging the local community and stakeholders in a participatory\r\nplanning process. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease visit Objective Design Standards website\r\nfor more\r\ninformation about the RFP and the project.\r\n\r\nDEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Friday, November 19, 2021 by 2:00 pm PST via iSupplier\r\n\r\nNOTE: Interested consultants must Register with iSupplier\r\n(the City\r\nof Oakland's procurement portal) to submit a proposal. \r\n\r\nInterested in partnership opportunities?\r\nFill out our Expression of Interest form\r\n\r\nto be identified as a firm interested in collaborating with other\r\nfirm(s) and to download the RFP.
