Congress has held briefings on these phenomena; they produced no definitive answers from the U.S. government. https://ktxs.com/news/nation-world/pentagon-officials-hold-classified-briefing-with-congressn-uaps-ufos-new-jersey-sightings-drones-police-fbi-faa-regulations-bedminster-donald-trump-military-sites; https://thenationaldesk.com/news/americas-news-now/pentagon-officials-hold-classified-briefing-with-congressn-uaps-ufos-new-jersey-sightings-drones-police-fbi-faa-regulations-bedminster-donald-trump-military-sites\r\n\r\n9. In the absence of definitive, public assessments, elected officials are considering a limited declaration of emergency: https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/12/10/New-Jersey-Jon-Bramnick-drones-UAP-UFO-limited-emergency/9881733858673/. \r\n\r\n10.  Congress previously required collection of UAP records by no later than February 2024 in sections 1841-43of the FY23 National Defense Authorization Act\u2019s adaptation of the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023. https://www.insidegovernmentcontracts.com/2024/01/implications-of-the-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-uap-amendment-in-the-2024-national-defense-authorization-act-ndaa/.  \r\n\r\n11. The White House has declared the sightings are not attributable to a foreign nation. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/13/drones-over-new-jersey-white-house-lawmakers/76956011007/. \r\n\r\n12. Government officials, including DOD\u2019s Susan Gough, have stated that the UAP activity is not attributable to a U.S. research program. \r\n\r\n13. At least one U.S. Senator has called for U.S. military assets to shoot down these UAP, notwithstanding the publicly stated position of federal and state officials that they are not hostile, not experimental, and not identified. https://abc7ny.com/post/new-jersey-drones-us-senator-says-mystery-devices-spotted-nj-should-shot-down-necessary/15647143/. \r\n\r\n14. True to form, New Jersey residents have also suggested taking matters into their own hands and shooting down the phenomena as well. https://www.foxnews.com/us/drones-mystery-new-jersey-homeowners-threaten-take-matters-own-hands-govt-doesnt-act.\r\n\r\n15. In the absence of clear, consistent communications from U.S. officials, heightened tensions regarding the inability or unwillingness of the government to explain what is happening above the skies of New Jersey, there is an increasing risk to the health and safety of people who are making the reports and capturing the video images of whoever or whatever is visiting the Garden State.\r\n\r\n16.
