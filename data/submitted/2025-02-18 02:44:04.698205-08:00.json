[https://ussliberty.org]\r\n\r\nOn June 8, 2005 the USS Liberty Veterans Association submitted \u201cA Report: War Crimes Committed Against U.S. Military Personnel, June 8, 1967\u201d to the Secretary of the Army in his capacity as Executive Agent for the Secretary of Defense. \r\n\r\nA copy of that report is at https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25497919-war-crimes-report-with-exhibits/.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Defense Law of War Manual requires \u201cDoD policy has required that the commander of any unit that obtains information about a reportable incident shall immediately report the incident through the applicable operational command and Military Department.\u201d [Paragraph 18.13.2, DoD Law of War Manual Page 1100]\r\n\r\nThe footnote on page 1100 states in part, \u201cAll reportable incidents committed by or against U.S. personnel, enemy persons, or any other individual are reported promptly, investigated thoroughly, and, where appropriate, remedied by corrective action.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe DoD Law of War Manual is at https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/DoD%20Law%20of%20War%20Manual%20-%20June%202015%20Updated%20Dec%202016.pdf.\r\n\r\nAn excerpt of the relevant passage in the Law of War Manual is attached.\r\n\r\nA reportable incident committed against U.S. personnel was reported to the Flag and other high-ranking US Navy officers serving on the US Navy Court of Inquiry when USS Liberty survivor Lloyd Painter testified under oath during the US Navy Court of Inquiry that he witnessed the IDF torpedo boats deliberately machine gunning of life rafts we had dropped over the side in anticipation of abandoning ship.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving a copy of the US Navy Court of Inquiry Report, Painter noted that the portion of his testimony referenced above does not appear in the Report of the Court.\r\n\r\nIn his sworn deposition, Painter writes:\r\n\r\n\u201c1515 Hours: I climbed the ladder and opened the hatch to the main deck. I wanted to see if it was safe enough to bring the wounded sailors out onto the main deck. What I saw sent ice running through my veins. The life rafts were either destroyed or had been cut loose and had floated away. I personally observed an Israeli MTB methodically machine gun one of the Liberty's empty life rafts that had been cut loose and was floating in the water. I knew at that split second that the thrust of the IDF attack was to kill every American sailor on board. There were to be no survivors that day. I decided to leave all of the wounded sailors below decks for some measure of protection. I did not prepare to abandon ship.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe have attached a complete copy of Lloyd Painter\u2019s sworn deposition to this request.\r\n\r\nWe are requesting a copy of the investigation of the War Crimes investigation that is mandated by the Department of Defense Manual.\r\n\r\nWe are further requesting a copy of all records related to or mentioning our submission of \u201cA Report: War Crimes Committed Against U.S. Military Personnel, June 8, 1967\u201d\r\n\r\nWE ARE NOT ASKING FOR ANOTHER COPY OF A US NAVY COURT OF INQUIRY REPORT BUT FOR THE REPORT OF THE MANDATED INVESTIGATION, CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOD LAW OF WAR MANUAL, ESTABLISHED TO INVESTIGATE AND RESOLVE THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN OUR WAR CRIMES REPORT WHICH WE SUBMITTED TO THE DOD ON JUNE 8, 2005.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Additionally, please provide all versions of the data, including version 1 of the previously provided two-month file, as indicated by the version history in prior submissions.\r\n\r\nI also request all documents related to any changes or maintenance of shelter space capacity, including assessments or determinations of the need for additional or reduced capacity\u2014whether temporary or permanent\u2014or any documentation indicating no need for changes.

All records concerning the decision to draft, send, and publish your Office's February 3, 2025 letter to Mr. Elon Musk, sent via X.com to \"@elonmusk\" and published on X.com under \"@EagleEdMartin.\"\r\n\r\n2. All records concerning the decision to draft, send, and publish your Office's February 7, 2025 letter to Mr. Elon Musk and Mr. Steve Davis, sent via X.com to \"@elonmusk\" and published on X.com under \"@EagleEdMartin.\"\r\n\r\n3. All records concerning \"the referral of individuals and networks who appear to be stealing government property and/or threatening government employees\" described in your Office's February 7, 2025 letter to Elon Musk and Steve Davis. \r\n\r\n4. All records concerning communications between your office and DOGE (f/k/a United States Digital Service) concerning the topics discussed in the (a) the February 3, 2025 letter or (b) the February 7, 2025 letter\r\n\r\n5. All records concerning communications between your office and Elon Musk concerning the topics discussed in the (a) the February 3, 2025 letter or (b) the February 7, 2025 letter\r\n\r\n6. All records concerning communications between your office and X.com or X Corp. concerning the topics discussed in the (a) the February 3, 2025 letter or (b) the February 7, 2025 letter\r\n\r\n7. All records concerning communications between your office and WIRED (or Wired.com) concerning the topics discussed in the (a) the February 3, 2025 letter or (b) the February 7, 2025 letter\r\n\r\n8. All records concerning communications to or from your office concerning the publication of one or more of following names: Akash Bobba; Edward Coristine; Luke Farritor; Gautier Cole Killian; Gavin Kilger; or Ethan Shaotran.\r\n\r\n9. All records concerning  communications to or from your office about the X.com account \"@RayInsideOut.\"\r\n\r\n10. Any direct messages received at or sent from the X.com account \"@EagleEdMartin\" concerning (a) the February 3, 2025 letter; (b) the February 7, 2025 letter; or (c) the publication of the six names referenced above.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.5(e)(ii) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. \r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia becoming involved in a dispute over the disclosure of names of individuals involved with DOGE/US Digital Service and its acts. \r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a breaking news story of public interest. The U.S. Attorney added to the newsworthiness of this matter, posting two recent letters on Twitter threatening investigation of  those who publish information related to DOGE's activities and related current events (those Twitter posts have tens of thousands of engagements). That issue has attracted a wide range of recent news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below.  The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis because it concerns the policies and actions of federal law enforcement concerning the publication of information related to DOGE and related current events. Those policies and decisions are uncertain, as indicated by the US Attorney's letters. Disclosing policies and information pertaining to ongoing decisions and policies facilitates the ability of the public, the press, and advocates to provide feedback with respect to those decisions and policies. If that information is only disclosed months or years later, it will inhibit the ability of the public to understand how its current officials are making decisions.\r\n\r\nExamples of social media postings and recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include:\r\n\r\nX.com:\r\nhttps://x.com/EagleEdMartin/status/1887901087983689761\r\nhttps://x.com/EagleEdMartin/status/1886456136032817488\r\nhttps://x.com/USAO_DC/status/1886537850390483276\r\n\r\nThe New Republic: https://newrepublic.com/post/191087/us-attorney-threaten-target-opponents-elon-musk-doge\r\nThe Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/03/martin-supports-for-musk-doge/\r\nThe New York TImes: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/business/media/elon-musk-doxxing-marko-elez.html\r\nWestern Journals: https://www.westernjournal.com/elon-just-got-legendary-letter-trumps-doj-threats-doge-finished/\r\nSlate: https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/02/trump-musk-doge-staffer-resigns-ed-martin-us-attorney-jan-6.html\r\nAxios: https://www.axios.com/2025/02/07/musk-doge-us-attorney-inquiry\r\nNewsweek: https://www.newsweek.com/trump-us-attorney-ed-martin-inquiry-elon-musk-2027976\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.10(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the policies, procedures, and practices of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia as it pertains to the publications of information about government activities, implicating the Speech and Press clauses of the First Amendment.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Office's activities and operations, as the information pertains to the policies and underlying information driving decisions by senior law enforcement officials. Disclosing the policies and other information would demonstrate the bases for those decisions, which have attracted substantial public attention, as demonstrated by the articles and press statements cited above. That information is not in the public domain.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law, including its application to members of the press. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news, and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles) can be found at https://thefire.org/news.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJT Morris",

We are requesting data starting in 2003 through the most recent year with full data availability in the TSLED and AA systems.\r\n\r\nFrom our research we believe this data is collected by various New York State law enforcement agencies and processed with the Traffic and Criminal Software (TraCS). Furthermore, based on the New York State FFY 2024 - 2026 Triennial Highway Safety Plan [found here: https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2023-10/NY_FY24HSP-tag.pdf] we have reason to believe that UTT data from TraCS is sent electronically to a central repository, maintained by the NYS ITS (Office of Information Technology Services) before being delivered from the repository to the NYS DMV. Furthermore, based on the Dec. '19 TraCS System Study [found here: http://fltrafficrecords.com/pdf/TraCS%20System%20Study%20-%20Final%20Report%20with%20Appendices.pdf] for the Florida Department of Transportation State Safety Office that New York State Police participated in, we believe that electronic UTT data was first collected via TraCS in 2003 and about 67% of all vehicle tickets given out in New York State are process through TraCS and in the TSLED and AA.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, based on our knowledge the following forms/sections in TraCS should contain some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the UTT data we are requesting:\r\n\"Violations\"\r\n\"Individual\"\r\n\"Vehicle\"\r\n\"Location\"\r\n\"Court\"\r\n\"Sub Dep\"\r\n\"OfficersNotes\"\r\n\"Attach 1\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, these are some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the detailed data values that are collected in the TraCS system that we are requesting:\r\n\"Ticket Number\"\r\n\"Police Agency\"\r\n\"Sequence #\"\r\n\"Local Police Code\"\r\n\"Photo Lic Shown\"\r\n\"Last Name(Defendant)\"\r\n\"First Name\"\r\n\"MI\"\r\n\"Suffix\"\r\n\"Number and Street\"\r\n\"Apt.

If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files).

If a final determination will not be made within 20 business days of your acknowledgment, please provide a written explanation of the reasons for your agency's inability to grant the request within such time period and specify a date certain within a reasonable period of time when this request will be granted in whole or in part, as required by Public Officers Law \u00a7 89[3] and 21 NYCRR \u00a7 1401.5(c)(4).\r\n\r\nIf further clarification is needed in order for your agency to locate the requested records, please immediately contact me.
