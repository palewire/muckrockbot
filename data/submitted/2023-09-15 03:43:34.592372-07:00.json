I have tied d to press charges twice through the Greene County Sheriff Office, but they have denied me twice after resigning as a case manager due to fear for my life. After filing a petition for the way SMCI treats their employees, I found out that 6 other women were injured and the prison never pressed charges or convicted the inmates.  I was a case manager who resigned due to fee for my life. The y never investigated or called. Please help us! The media will not report our stories.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Last night 3 bags of concrete were dropped off.  Today landscape rock was purchase and i directed the truck to park on the lawn instead of blocking a lane of this narrow F section street for the entire day like landscapers commonly do.\r\n\r\nWe got plastered with code violation notices and when I spoke to the code officer, he hung up on me.  \r\n\r\nPlease provide all records of code violations for contractors dropping off materials the day prior to work or the same day of work that were greeted with hostile code violation notices.  Especially when the work was completed the same day and the materials were gone.\r\n\r\nI've seen roofing materials, fencing, mulch, bags of landscape rock exist on properties for weeks or months.  Is there a new one day rule that Palm Coast is initiating.  I asked the code officer if it would have been better for the truck to block an entire lane of traffic on this narrow F section road for the entire day.  He said that would be preferable and I would not have been violated for that.  Our government at work.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

We request a waiver of any fees or costs associated with this request.\r\n\r\nThis request concerns a matter of public interest. The protection of First Amendment rights at public universities, like the University of North Alabama, is of vital concern to the students, faculty, and administrators of that university, and to the greater academic community and the public at large. This request seeks records regarding the University of North Alabama's handling of faculty speech and expressive freedoms.The records are not sought for a commercial or personal interest, but rather for the purpose of providing the public with information concerning civil liberties in higher education.\r\n\r\nIf you elect to charge a fee, please provide a cost estimate for each category of documents requested. Please also provide me with a W9 form.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if any specific categories of requested records will require a significantly longer production time than those in other categories, please provide records for each category on a piecemeal basis, as they become available.\r\n\r\nRequest for Privilege Log: If any otherwise responsive documents are withheld on the basis that they are privileged or fall within a statutory exemption, please provide a privilege log setting forth (1) the subject matter of the document; (2) the person(s) who sent and received the document; (3) the date the document was created or sent; and (4) the basis on which the document is withheld.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9 Natta, a citizen of Alabama, in coordination with Anne Marie Tamburro.",
