Miller\u2019s property in Stamford, Vermont in August 2022, as chronicled in the Rolling Stone article titled 'The Ezra Miller Saga Now Involves Vermont\u2019s Child Services Department' (published August 10, 2022, available at: https://web.archive.org/web/20241215093133/https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/ezra-miller-vermont-child-services-department-1392572/). \r\nThe article details attempts by Vermont State Police to serve an emergency care order on August 6, 7, and 9, 2022, at Miller\u2019s 96-acre farm, intended to remove a 25-year-old mother and her three children amid supposed welfare concerns, with oversight by the Vermont Department for Children and Families (DCF) and potential involvement of the Vermont Attorney General\u2019s Office in legal proceedings. \r\nMost notably, the article includes information or statements attributed to the Attorney\u2019s Office suggesting the property owner was attempting to \"evade\" or \"shield\" someone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I seek the following from August 1, 2022, through December 31, 2023:  \r\n\r\n- Vermont State Police incident reports, affidavits, dispatch logs, recordings or transcripts of any 911 calls received or made, and bodycam footage related to attempts to serve the emergency care order at Miller\u2019s Stamford property on August 6, 7, and 9, 2022, or in connection with the welfare of the mother and her three children that prompted police responses on those dates; plus any police records documenting subsequent actions or follow-up related to aforementioned alleged child welfare concerns at the property after August 9, 2022.  \r\n\r\n- Vermont Attorney General\u2019s Office correspondence (e.g., emails, memos, letters, documents, etc) with Vermont State Police or DCF regarding the emergency care order, its execution, or its resolution; legal opinions or memoranda concerning its enforcement; and any court filings, hearing records, or notices related to the emergency care order or to additional later hearings (referenced in the Rolling Stone article) scheduled on or after August 10, 2022.  \r\n\r\n- Any relevant correspondence between Vermont State Police and the Vermont Attorney General\u2019s Office concerning the welfare of the mother and her three children or the execution of the emergency care order. if any responsive records are held by DCF or even out-of-state agencies, I request coordination with that agency or referral of my request to ensure relevant obtainable documents are obtained.\r\n\r\nI request that any exempt personal information (e.g., names of minors or private individuals) be redacted rather than withholding documents entirely, consistent with the Vermont Public Records Act\u2019s presumption of disclosure (1 V.S.A. \u00a7 315 et seq.).\r\nI am not affiliated with any news agencies & this request is not being made for commercial purposes. This inquiry serves the public interest by shedding light on the resolution of a widely publicized matter (yet for some reason never followed up on by news organizations) involving child welfare and inter-agency action, fostering transparency in governmental proceedings, and discouraging vigilante justice from members of the public who, due to rampant disinformation by omission, might be inclined to take matters into their own hands against a perceived child abductor.  \r\n\r\nIf there are any issues with the scope or specificity of this request, please contact me to discuss it before denying or delaying the response.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPJ",

If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files). Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, we additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nA waiver of search and review fees is appropriate here because disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(a), (b)(1)-(2), and because the request is not primarily in our commercial interest, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 5.45(a), (b)(3)(ii).\r\n\r\nThis Request is Not Primarily in Our Commercial Interest:\r\nThe requested information is not being sought for commercial purposes. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(a). We are news media requesters that can and will \u201ceffectively convey information to the public.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(ii).\r\n\r\nProduction of Responsive Records on a Rolling Basis:\r\nIn the event that a portion of the present request is completed before the full request is completed, we ask that the records be produced on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nLimitation of Fees:\r\nWe are also entitled to a limitation of fees because we are members of the news media. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). Accordingly, even if our application for a waiver of all fees is denied, we are entitled to a limitation of fees. As a news media requester, we are\u201centitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of duplication\u201d and can be charged only duplication fees after the first 100 pages or its cost equivalent. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b). We request that the information be provided in its native electronic format, and thus there should be no duplication fees.\r\n\r\nRequest for Explanation of Withholdings and Redactions:\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide a reasonable description of any withheld materials and a justification for all such withholdings that includes reference to the specific FOIA exemptions authorizing withholding and specific reasons why such exemptions apply. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.31. An agency shall withhold information only if \u201cthe agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\u201d or \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i). (Per Attorney General Garland\u2019s March 15, 2022 memorandum, \u201cIn case of doubt [regarding foreseeable harm or legal bar to disclosure], openness should prevail.\u201dWe therefore request that if the agency determines that an exemption applies, specific reasons be provided as to why disclosure would harm any interest protected by such exemption. An agency shall also \u201cconsider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible\u201d and \u201ctake reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii). We therefore request that the agency release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Pennsylvania Right to Know Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe database of all fishing licenses issued in Pennsylvania from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, including all non-exempt columns and tables of the database. \r\n\r\nWe request these records in their native digital formats and not in formats that degrade the accessibility of the records, such as tabular data converted to PDF or Word files. If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files). Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, we additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nA waiver of search and review fees is appropriate here because disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(a), (b)(1)-(2), and because the request is not primarily in our commercial interest, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 5.45(a), (b)(3)(ii).\r\n\r\nThis Request is Not Primarily in Our Commercial Interest:\r\nThe requested information is not being sought for commercial purposes. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(a). We are news media requesters that can and will \u201ceffectively convey information to the public.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.54(b)(2)(ii).\r\n\r\nProduction of Responsive Records on a Rolling Basis:\r\nIn the event that a portion of the present request is completed before the full request is completed, we ask that the records be produced on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nLimitation of Fees:\r\nWe are also entitled to a limitation of fees because we are members of the news media. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). Accordingly, even if our application for a waiver of all fees is denied, we are entitled to a limitation of fees. As a news media requester, we are\u201centitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of duplication\u201d and can be charged only duplication fees after the first 100 pages or its cost equivalent. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.53(b). We request that the information be provided in its native electronic format, and thus there should be no duplication fees.\r\n\r\nRequest for Explanation of Withholdings and Redactions:\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide a reasonable description of any withheld materials and a justification for all such withholdings that includes reference to the specific FOIA exemptions authorizing withholding and specific reasons why such exemptions apply. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.31. An agency shall withhold information only if \u201cthe agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\u201d or \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i). (Per Attorney General Garland\u2019s March 15, 2022 memorandum, \u201cIn case of doubt [regarding foreseeable harm or legal bar to disclosure], openness should prevail.\u201dWe therefore request that if the agency determines that an exemption applies, specific reasons be provided as to why disclosure would harm any interest protected by such exemption. An agency shall also \u201cconsider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible\u201d and \u201ctake reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii). We therefore request that the agency release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDillon Bergin",

The drug, publicly identified by the government as a hallucinogen, was reported to the DEA's NFLIS sometime between January 1st 2024 and September 30th 2024. A copy of the September 2024 NFLIS-Drug bulletin that mentions Deoxmethoxetamine should be attached to this request. \r\n\r\nThis is a request for any documents, reports, memorandum, or anything that could reasonably be construed as \"relevant documents\" related to Deoxmethoxetamine created by the NFLIS during this period.
