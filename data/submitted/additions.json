I am aware that many records in the NSC Intelligence Programs directorate may be classified. I request that these documents be subjected to a Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) if they are found to be responsive but currently withheld under Exemption 1. If certain parts of this request or certain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you to the William J. Clinton Library, and the library's commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
