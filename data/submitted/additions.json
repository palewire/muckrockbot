        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am writing to request any and all records related to threats made against Senator Dianne Feinstein and her husband, including but not limited to the following:\r\n\r\nDocuments, memos, or reports related to threats made against Senator Feinstein and her husband, including those obtained through the use of electronic surveillance (ELSUR) and keystring searches;\r\n\r\nSocial media posts, comments, or messages related to threats made against Senator Feinstein and her husband;\r\n\r\nFollow-up investigations conducted by the FBI or any other law enforcement agency in relation to these threats, including any interagency searches.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the search for these records, I suggest using the following keystring search terms:\r\n\r\nDianne Feinstein\r\nRichard Blum\r\nThreats\r\nHarassment\r\nIntimidation\r\nViolence\r\nAssault\r\n\r\nGiven the potentially large scope of this request, I respectfully request that the FBI provide any responsive records on a rolling basis, as they become available. This will help ensure that I receive responsive records in a timely manner and allow me to more effectively manage and prioritize the review of the records.To the extent that records are withheld or redacted, I ask that you provide the specific legal basis for the withholding or redaction, and that you provide any segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. In addition, I remind you that FOIA requires agencies to produce records in their entirety, even if portions of the records are exempt from disclosure. See, e.g., Bevis v. Department of State, 801 F.2d 1386, 1389 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (stating that an agency must \"release all reasonably segregable portions of [the] record\").\r\n\r\nI also remind you that FOIA requires agencies to disclose records even if they have been deleted or improperly redacted. See, e.g., Payne Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 486, 488 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (stating that an agency must \"conduct a reasonable search for records, and cannot limit its search to only those records that it believes to be intact\").\r\n\r\nIf any records responsive to this request have been destroyed, deleted, or otherwise disposed of, I ask that you provide the following information:\r\n\r\nThe date and circumstances of the disposal or destruction;\r\n\r\nThe name, title, and position of the person who authorized the disposal or destruction;\r\n\r\nThe name, title, and position of the person or persons responsible for carrying out the disposal or destruction;\r\n\r\nThe procedures that were followed for disposing of or destroying the records; and\r\n\r\nA description of the records that were destroyed or disposed of.\r\n\r\nFinally, I remind you that FOIA provides for attorney's fees and litigation costs to be awarded to a prevailing plaintiff. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E). Therefore, I urge you to comply fully with this request and to respond within the statutory time frame.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan",

This request includes metadata associated with the records, such as author, date, and time of creation.\r\n\r\nRecent reports have indicated that Governor Newsom has received numerous threats of violence and harm during his time in office. As a concerned citizen and advocate for transparency, I request access to any documents, emails, or other information in the possession of the Governor's Office of California that relate to these threats.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer to the following court cases and legal principles:\r\n\r\nSoucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067 (D.C. Cir. 1971): This case held that the public has a strong interest in obtaining information about government activities, including any threats made against public officials.\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004): This case held that FOIA requires agencies to disclose records unless the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption.\r\n\r\nFOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Pub. L. No. 114-185, 130 Stat. 538 (2016): This law updated and strengthened the Freedom of Information Act, emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in government and requiring agencies to proactively disclose certain records to the public.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in a readable electronic format, such as PDF or Microsoft Word, and include the metadata associated with the records. If any portion of this request is denied or exempt from disclosure, please cite the specific exemption and provide an index of the withheld or redacted records, as required by law.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold or delete responsive documents will be appealed in a court of law. Any such actions may result in legal proceedings to compel the production of the records and any applicable penalties. I also request that any responsive records be provided on a rolling basis, meaning that records should be provided as they become available instead of waiting for all records to be collected before responding to the request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
