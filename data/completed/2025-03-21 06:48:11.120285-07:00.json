Peay for his last year as Superintendent and for Maj. Gen. Wins each of his years as Superintendent to include, without limitation, the most current version.\r\n\r\nAccording to the BOV ByLaws: \"It shall define its expectations and set goals for the Superintendent and annually review the Superintendent\u2019s performance with reference to those expectations and goals.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the BOV Statement of Governance: \" It shall define its expectations and set goals for the Superintendent and annually review the Superintendent\u2019s performance with reference to those expectations and goals.\"\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I am NOT asking for the actual performance appraisals of either Gen. Peay or Maj. Gen. Wins by the BOV as those would contain personal information. This is only for the objective criteria approved by the BOV, with when and how it was approved, that established those performance criteria upon which evaluations, bonuses, etc. were acted on.\r\n\r\nI am willing to take incremental fulfillment of this FOIA so, for example,s the expectations and goals the Superintendent was evaluated on in the recent BOV Special Meeting where the BOV voted not to extend his contract should be available immediately.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll bureau files covering investigations into the Minutemen organization in the following cities: Chicago (105-11643), Los Angeles (62-5101), Miami (105-4921), Phoenix (105-1226), and San Diego (100-12461). The Minutemen were a right-wing paramilitary group founded in June 1960 by businessman Robert Bolivar DePugh and operated in some capacity in cities throughout the United States between 1960 and 1969. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has already made public files on Robert Bolivar DePugh and Minutemen operations in cities like New York City, so I am asking the FBI provide copies of files on these additional cities so the public may have a greater understanding of this organization and its place within the social unrest of the sixties.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media, and I am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I have written for Philly Voice and Atlas Obscura. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $250. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To FOIA Appeals Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information (FOIA) Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am appealing the following:\r\n\r\nOn November 22, 2022, I submitted Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) request number 1510574-000 via MuckRock seeking all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records on the Chicago chapter of paramilitary group the Minutemen. At that time, I included the chapter\u2019s Bureau file number (105-11643) for reference purposes.\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 2022, I received a response letter from the FBI releasing only one page from the chapter\u2019s Bureau file and rejecting the rest of my request. The rejection letter cited FOIA exemptions (b)(3) 50 U.S.C., \u00a7 3024 (i)(1), (b)(6), (b)(7)(c), and (b)(7)(e). I am appealing these exemptions for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n(b)(6) and (b)(7)(c): Exemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(c) are written to protect the rights of individuals against a clear and unwarranted \u201cinvasion of personal privacy,\u201d with (b)(6) specifically covering personnel and medical files. First, I am not requesting personnel or medical files; I am asking for files from investigations into a right-wing paramilitary group. I believe exemption (b)(6) may have been included in error and request a review of this exemption.\r\n\r\nNext, persons and groups may retain privacy rights under some circumstances, but, per the United States Court of Appeals, District Columbia Circuit, in Fund for Constitutional Government v. National Archives & Records Service, these rights yield \u201cwhere exceptional interests militate in favor of disclosure.\u201d Through actions and public statements made by Minuteman founder Robert Bolivar DePugh, the Minutemen and any subsequent chapters have no expectations of privacy because they are figures of exceptional public interest. Mr. DePugh spoke at length with newspapers about the group and participated in an unofficial biography, published in 1968 under the title \"The Minutemen\" (later re-released in 1969 as \"A Private Army\").\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the FBI has already released files on Robert Bolivar DePugh and the Minutemen to researcher John Greenwald, Jr. in 2018, as part of FOIPA request number 1415062-000 (attached under \"1510574-000 Appeal Documents\"). Other files on the New York City chapter were released to researcher Ernie Lazar prior to that (attached under \"1510574-000 Appeal Documents\"). These documents are publicly accessible in a variety of formats as of the writing of this appeal; Mr. Greenwald\u2019s can be found on his site, The Black Vault, while Mr. Lazar\u2019s are collected at the Internet Archive. Privacy concerns cannot be re-extended to figures where they have already been waived or determined no longer applicable.\r\n\r\n(b)(3) 50 U.S.C., \u00a7 3024 (i)(1) and (b)(7)(e): These exemption cover information that disclose \u201cintelligence sources and methods\u201d and \u201ctechniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\" However, these would not apply as the group in question, the Minutemen, ceased operations and disbanded in the 1970s. Although individuals may have claimed to revive the group at various points since then, there are no active chapters of the Minutemen at this time. The group\u2019s founder, Robert Bolivar DePugh, passed away on June 30, 2009 (attached as \"Minuteman outlasted notoriety...\"). In the absence of a functioning body and the death of Mr. DePugh, the release of these files would not risk circumvention of the law by any living parties.\r\n\r\nMany of the intelligence sources for the FBI have also been disclosed elsewhere. These individuals include: Michael Desmond Sadewhite, who served as a Bureau informant from 1966 until 1967 (attached under \"1510574-000 Appeal Documents\"); Henry Edward Warren, who disclosed information on the Minutemen from 1966 to 1968; and Jerry Milton Brooks, who testified against Mr. DePugh in 1966 and later claimed to have worked as an informant for both the FBI and then-Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Unit. These individuals have all been identified publicly in newspaper articles during the 1960s and 1970s or in J. Harry Jones\u2019s book \"The Minutemen\".\r\n\r\nAlso, as previously mentioned, documents containing information about Mr. DePugh and the Minutemen have been released in other FOIPA releases in the past. Any concerns over disclosures with regard to intelligence sources or law enforcement investigation techniques or methods would have been voided upon the release of those documents.\r\n\r\nFinally, I am renewing my request for a fee waiver. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including CovertAction Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response to this appeal. I appreciate the work that the FBI's Information Management Division does in processing FOIA requests and disseminating eligible material. As provided in 5 U.S.C. subsection 552(a)(6)(A)(ii), I anticipate that you will produce responsive documents within twenty (20) working days of receipt of this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Please consider this communication confirmation of my intention to continue with these requests. No circumstances have changed on my end, and I am still very much interested in obtaining these records.\r\n\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to renew my request for a fee waiver. My bylines include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThank you for your guidance through the FOIPA process. I greatly appreciate the work the FBI's Information Management Division does in reviewing and releasing all eligible records.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Your request has been attached to this email.\u00a0In your original request, you were seeking \"Transcript of all captioned media\". \r\n\r\nOn October 9, 2023, in response to a request for clarification, you narrowed your request to the following \"please search your Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) for all captioned media for years between 1979 and 2024\". \r\n\r\nOn November 1, 2023, we asked for further clarification and you responded with the following \"I am seeking transcripts of all captioned media. Your YouTube channel was mentioned as a possible source though I am seeking record that features transcripts for television, music, movies, training videos, etc, an all encompassing manifest of transcription by your agency that has not been fully addressed by the public\". \r\n\r\nBased on your October 9, 2023 communication, we are interpreting your request as all captioned media (television, music, movies, training videos, etc.)\u00a0within Office of Special Education Programs between 1979 and 2024. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this interpretation is accurate. If it is not accurate and you are seeking all Department of Education's captioned media, please refer back to our original request for clarification sent on October 6, 2023. \r\n\r\nI happy to discuss further if you have any questions. \r\nThank you! \r\n\r\nMichael Tobias \r\nGovernment InformationSpecialist \r\nFOIA Service Center \r\nOffice of the Secretary \r\nU.S. Department of Education \r\n(202) 401-8365 FOIA Hotline",

I seek records related to the submissions that the agency chose to \u201credact, or withhold\u2026such as those containing private or proprietary information, inappropriate language, or duplicate/near duplicate examples of a mass-mail campaign.\u201d \r\n\r\nI believe the records that I are located, inter alia, within agency headquarters, in email records, and in third-party platforms used to manage the Agency\u2019s public comments.\r\n\r\nThe I request include but are not limited to: \r\n\r\n1.\tRecords of the public comments submitted to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau, which were NOT posted on Regulations.gov for public viewing. \r\n2.\tRecords related to the decision to redact or withhold certain public comments from the public comment section of Regulations.gov \u2013 as it specifically relates to the proposed rule \u201cApprehension, Processing, Care, and Custody of Alien Minors and Unaccompanied Alien Children.\u201d  \r\na.\tincluding:\r\ni.\tAny correspondence or record of correspondence regarding the redaction or withholding of public comments sent through official government email addresses or messaging services; and\r\nii.\tincluding correspondence sent through private third-party services such as Gmail or Slack; and\r\niii.\tIncluding any messages, notes, or annotations created on a third-party social media management platform.\r\nb.\tDocumentation of the agency\u2019s existing policy regarding the preservation and maintenance of tweets as per the Federal Records Act, and Federal Records Management Bulletin 2014-02 (available at https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2014/2014-02.htm), which stated that \u201c\u2026 A complete Federal record must have content, context, and structure along with associated metadata (e.g., author, date of creation). The complete record must be maintained to ensure reliability and authenticity.\u201d\r\nc.\tAny briefings, reports, memoranda, legal opinions, policy statements, or talking points used or disseminated within the Agency regarding the redaction or withholding of specific or general public comments.\r\n\r\nI urge [Agency] to process this request consistent with \u201ca general philosophy of full agency disclosure [under FOIA] unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language,\u201d United States Dep't of Def. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 510 U.S. 487, 494 (1994), and the Justice Department\u2019s policy directing a presumption of disclosure. See Dep\u2019t of Justice Office of Information Policy, President Obama\u2019s FOIA Memorandum and Attorney General Holder\u2019s FOIA Guidelines: Creating a \u201cNew Era of Open Government\u201d (2009), available at https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-2009-creating-new-era-open-government). \r\n\r\nRequest for Public Interest Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested records is in the public interest. It \u201cis likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the activities or operations of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).\r\n\r\nFirst, the records concern the operations or activities of the government. Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. Specifically, the requested records will reveal substantial new information about how the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau defines and manages public comments. They will allow the public to see what public messages have been rescinded and the process by which these statements were retracted as compared to the processes employed by other agencies.  \r\nFor example, my research on the Twitter account of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base revealed to the public that the account had systematically deleted controversial tweets. See Brady Dale, To What Extent is a Tweet a Federal Record?,  TECHNICAL.LY BROOKLYN (October 24, 2017), (https://technical.ly/brooklyn/2017/10/24/muira-mccammon-talks-gitmo-radical-networks/).\r\n\r\nFinally, the records are not primarily in my own commercial interest. I seek the requested information for newsgathering purposes, and expect to incorporate it into journalistic work product to be disseminated to the public, like those already produced. See Muira Mccammon, Trouble @JTFGTMO, SLATE (April 17, 2018), https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/why-did-the-joint-task-force-of-guantanamo-start-deleting-tweets.html; Muira McCammon, Can They Really Delete That?, SLATE (April 17, 2018), https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/why-did-the-joint-task-force-of-guantanamo-start-deleting-tweets.html.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons above, I respectfully request that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau grant a public interest fee waiver for this request, and that all fees related to the search, review, and duplication of the requested records be waived. If the fees will not be waived, I agree to pay up to $100 for the processing of this request. If the estimated fees will exceed this limit, please inform me before you begin processing.\r\nRequest for \u201cNews Media\u201d Fee Status \r\n\r\nAs a freelance journalist, I am a representative of the news media and do not seek the records requested for commercial use. Therefore, if the agency does not find that my request meets the standards required for a public interest fee waiver, I request that fees associated with the processing of my request be limited to reasonable duplication costs. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).\r\nI am a representative of the news media because I \u201cgather[] information of potential interest to a segment of the public, use[] [my] editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distribute[] that work to an audience.\u201d Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). I can \u201cdemonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication\u2026 by a\u2026 past publication record.\u201d Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). \r\n\r\nMy work has been featured in publications including Slate, VICE, the Massachusetts Review, Kill Screen, and more. I have previously requested documents obtained via FOIA from a range of federal agencies and government officials regarding the deletion of tweets from official Twitter accounts. I used that information to write a series of articles outlining both how individual agencies decided whether or not to delete tweets and more broadly how the government regards Twitter statements. These articles have been published, disseminated, and further reported upon to a broad audience. See Muira Mccammon, Trouble @JTFGTMO, SLATE (April 17, 2018), https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/why-did-the-joint-task-force-of-guantanamo-start-deleting-tweets.html; Muira Mccammon, Can They Really Delete That?, SLATE (April 17, 2018), https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/why-did-the-joint-task-force-of-guantanamo-start-deleting-tweets.html.. \r\nTherefore, if this request is not classified as being in the public interest, I respectfully request to be classified as a \u201cnews media\u201d requester for purposes of fee assessments. \r\n***\r\nI request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format, if possible. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). I further request that you provide an estimated date on which you will finish processing this request. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B).\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. As per 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), I expect your determination on whether to comply with this request within twenty (20) days. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at the email address listed below.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nMuira McCammon",

They will allow the public to see what public messages have\r\nbeen rescinded and the process by which these statements were retracted as\r\ncompared to the processes employed by other agencies.\r\nFor example, my research on the Twitter account of the Guantanamo Bay Naval\r\nBase revealed to the public that the account had systematically deleted\r\ncontroversial tweets. See Brady Dale, To What Extent is a Tweet a Federal\r\nRecord?, TECHNICAL.LY BROOKLYN (October 24, 2017),\r\n(https://technical.ly/brooklyn/2017/10/24/muira-mccammon-talks-gitmo-radical-networks/).\r\n\r\nFinally, the records are not primarily in my own commercial interest.

If the fees will not be waived, I agree to\r\npay up to $100 for the processing of this request.

Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period.

You have requested all agency records, from September 7, 2018 to August 25, 2019, concerning public comments submitted to ICE related to the proposed rule, \u201cApprehension, Processing, Care, and Custody of Alien Minors and Unaccompanied Alien Children\u201d (see request for details). ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nA search of the ICE Office of Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO), ICE Office of Regulatory Affairs and Policy (ORAP) and ICE Office of Management and Administrative Services for records responsive to your request produced 57 pages and 1 Excel Spreadsheet that are responsive to your request.  Portions of 57 pages and 1 Excel Spreadsheet will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.

Bloodworth, 24, crashed her Tesla on her father\u2019s private island while allegedly driving under the influence. Responding Monroe County deputies encountered her inside the wrecked vehicle, where she initially refused to exit, claiming, \u201cMy father owns this island!\u201d Upon being removed, she resisted arrest, kicked and screamed, and was recorded on bodycam crying, \u201cI need my dad here!\u201d Deputies later used an airboat to recover evidence, including open vodka bottles. She was arrested and charged with DUI, resisting arrest, and fleeing law enforcement.\r\n\r\nI am requesting the following records related to this incident:\r\n\r\nAll available body-worn camera footage from all deputies involved in the response, arrest, and transportation of Stephanie Bloodworth, specifically between 9:00 PM and 9:30 PM\r\nAll available dashboard camera dashcam footage from all responding patrol vehicles present at the scene\r\nAll 911 call recordings and dispatch logs related to this incident, including radio communications and CAD reports\r\nThe complete incident and arrest reports, including all officer narratives, supplemental reports, and use-of-force documentation\r\nThe full DUI report, blood alcohol test results, and any toxicology findings associated with this case\r\nAll booking documents, jail intake records, and any recorded statements made by Stephanie Bloodworth following her arrest\r\nAll photographs taken by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office MCSO during or after the arrest, including images of the suspect, the crashed Tesla, the crash site, and recovered evidence such as open vodka bottles\r\nAny video footage from airboat operations or any surveillance footage that may have captured the crash, response, or evidence recovery\r\nAny internal reviews or reports related to this incident, including documents regarding the use of an airboat for evidence retrieval\r\nAny press releases, social media posts, or official statements made by the Monroe County Sheriff\u2019s Office regarding this incident\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this request is to serve the public interest by making these records publicly accessible. While I acknowledge that I may also generate revenue from the dissemination of these materials, the request primarily serves to enhance transparency regarding this law enforcement incident.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees associated with fulfilling this request, as disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding of law enforcement practices and actions. However, if a full fee waiver is not possible, please inform me of the estimated costs in advance. Additionally, if fees can be reduced or eliminated by excluding certain records, please specify which records those would be.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records in an electronic format if available. If any portions of this request are denied, please cite the specific legal exemption(s) and provide a redacted version of the document where applicable.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPolice Cam News",

We do not any photographs, full DUI report, images of the crashed Tesla, the crashed site, and evidence of the open vodka bottles. It will take .5 hours to do the radio transmissions.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords of: \r\n- Officers with authorized access to ALPR systems\r\n- Any audits that include records for the reason of the search, misuse, and how many times the ALPR search was run. \r\n- The number of times other agencies, including federal agencies, with access to the department's ALPR data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nIn a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents your agency has signed under Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) from 2019 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are unnecessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d 2019 to today's date\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords of: \r\n- Officers with authorized access to ALPR systems\r\n- Any audits that include records for the reason of the search, misuse, and how many times the ALPR search was run. \r\n- The number of times other agencies, including federal agencies, with access to the department's ALPR data.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott",

Here is an example of what we are looking for from Etowah County, AL: https://etowahcounty.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/EtowahPrecincts-2023.pdf\r\n\r\nIf no map exists at all, we request 4) a copy of whatever is used to designate areas, and the voters living therein, to precincts (for example, metes and bounds of the exact boundaries, a street address file, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

The most recent public records should be produced first.\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\nEMAIL RECORDS\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\nFEES\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\nEXEMPTION LOGS\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\nGood Luck \n \n South Sound 911 interprets your request to mean you are requesting all records for the type of request selected from the drop down menu when creating your request unless otherwise identified in the details box.

The most recent public records should be produced first. \r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS \r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated. \r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS \r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints. \r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link. \r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service. \r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication. \r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL \r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records. \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\" \r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute. \r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT \r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production. \r\nEMAIL RECORDS \r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format. \r\nFEES \r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) \r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included. \r\nEXEMPTION LOGS \r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld. \r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION \r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL \r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email. \r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public. \r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\nGood Luck Request Status: Pending \r\nYour request listed above requires\u00a0additional time to process. You will be contacted within 30 days about the availability and/or provided with copies of the records in question. Thank you for your patience. \r\nSincerely, \r\nSOUTH SOUND 911 \r\nThis is an auto-generated email and has originated from an unmonitored email account. Please DO NOT REPLY.",

The most recent public records should be produced first. \r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS \r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated. \r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS \r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints. \r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link. \r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service. \r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication. \r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL \r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records. \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\" \r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute. \r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT \r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production. \r\nEMAIL RECORDS \r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format. \r\nFEES \r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) \r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included. \r\nEXEMPTION LOGS \r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld. \r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION \r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever.

As such, the requested documents are in the public interest and not being made for commercial purposes. Therefore, I ask that all fees are waived in the processing of my request. If fees associated with this request will be in excess of $25, kindly notify me in advance of fulfilling this request. As I am making this request as a journalist and this information is timely, I would appreciate your communicating with me if you have questions regarding this request.\r\n\r\nThanks again, and I look forward to your reply within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires and an even more prompt reply if you can make a determination without having to review the records in question.\r\n\r\n-Daniel Boguslaw",

Specifically:  \r\n\r\nThese reports are completed by the athletic department for the National Collegiate Athletic Association for the fiscal years listed above. This report is a multi-page document that had to be submitted to the NCAA in January. It contains 40+ revenue and expense categories, followed by specific breakdowns of each of those categories, by sport and gender. I am requesting the full report, including the detail tables, the \u201cOther Reporting Items\u201d list and the \u201cStatement of Revenues and Expenses\u201d that appears at the end of the report. PLEASE NOTE: The NCAA report is different than the equity report that is sent to the U.S. Department of Education for Title IX compliance.\r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the records electronically as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) on which you rely.  Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSonny Albarado, a citizen of Arkansas, in coordination with Stacey Brook.",

Your request states:\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nFind the request for proposal, statement of work, award notice, and all documents related to the contract award to Deloitte for Illinois Department of Early Childhood CCWIS System Integrator RFP B16539/B17047; Notice of Award made Dec 2021.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nDue to the size of the response, the response is being provided by SharePoint.  You will shortly receive an invitation to open the SharePoint file.\r\n\r\nYour response was redacted.  The Freedom of Information Act allows redaction of exempt information contained within an otherwise public record.  5 ILCS 140/7(1).  When a request is made to inspect or copy a public record that contains information that is exempt from disclosure under Section 7, but also contains information that is not exempt from disclosure, the public body may elect to redact the information that is exempt. The public body shall make the remaining information available for inspection and copying. 5 ILCS 140/7(1).\r\n\r\nRedactions may include, among other exemptions, private information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law, or a court order (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b)); and personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information (5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c)).  The redacted information in your response includes information exempt from disclosure as private information and personal information constituting a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.  Such information includes Social Security numbers, signatures, information protected by other statutes such as identities of children, home addresses, home telephone numbers and personal electronic mail addresses.  Other statutory exemptions and privacy protections may also apply.\r\n\r\nYou have the right to have your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your request for review with the PAC at:\r\n\r\nPublic Access Counselor\r\nOffice of the Attorney General\r\n500 South 2nd Street\r\nSpringfield, Illinois 62706\r\nFax: 217-782-1396\r\nE-mail: public.access@ilag.gov .\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).

McElwee, \r\n\r\nWe are in receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) requesting CBP maintained records. Specifically, you requested To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nRecords of travel (including any border crossings, records of referral to secondary screening, etc.) as well as any and Customs declarations for the individual named below (with identifying information) \r\n\r\nFull name: Henry Alfred Kissinger \r\nDOB: May 27, 1923 \r\nPOB: F\u00fcrth, Germany \r\n\r\nPlease note that it is likely that Kissinger had multiple passports. All records concerning the individual with the date of birth listed above should be considered responsive. \r\n\r\nMr. Kissinger is deceased. Please find proof of death attached. Privacy interests for dead persons are diminished. Records should be released in the overwhelming public interest as Kissinger was a highly influential diplomat, political scientist and geopolitical consultant who served as United States secretary of state and national security advisor under the presidential administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nT.

        "communication": "To whom it may concern:\r\n\r\nI hereby APPEAL the agency's response to the FOIA given tracking number CBP-FO-2024-027280, on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n1) The agency failed to acknowledge the request within the 20 business days. This constitutes an illegal constructive denial. \r\n\r\n2) The agency has failed to actually read the request and has sent a form letter illegally demanding that I provide identification as though I were requesting my own records. \r\n\r\nHad the agency read the request, it would see that I have requested \"Records of travel (including any border crossings, records of referral to secondary screening, etc.) as well as any and Customs declarations for the individual named below (with identifying information)\" for an individual named  Henry Alfred Kissinger, DOB: May 27, 1923, POB: F\u00fcrth, Germany.\r\n\r\nI am not Henry Alfred Kissinger; nor would I ever want to be. Upon information and belief, the agency has sent a form letter that does not even apply to this type of request. \r\n\r\n3) The agency was provided adequate evidence that Henry Alfred Kissinger is dead; to wit, a 4 page PDF of an obituary published by Associated Press. This obituary is attached, yet again. It is also available at a link: https://apnews.com/article/henry-kissinger-obit-secretary-of-state-d7d289c3a0b911ed9b863c219cee77e8\r\n\r\nOroof of death is proof enough that the requested records have diminished privacy concerns. \r\n\r\nMy prayer for relief is for CBP to provide the records as originally stated in the original FOIA request, provided to the agency on November 30, 2023. Additionally, I demand that this request be answered in the order it was received, as all delays have been on the part of the agency.\r\n\r\nThe agency shall be noticed that its response to this appeal shall exhaust administrative remedies, and failure to produce records in line with the Freedom of Information Act may be addressed with a legal action for which the agency will assume the costs of litigation to force its compliance. \r\n\r\nT.

McElwee: \n\nA search of CBP databases produced records responsive to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request CBP-FO-2024-027280, requesting records maintained by CBP. \n\nCBP has considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s guidance. CBP has determined that the responsive records are partially releasable, pursuant to Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 and have applied the appropriate exemptions notated below: \n\nSection 552 (FOIA) \n___ (b)(1) ___ (b)(2) ___ (b)(3) ___ (b)(4) ___ (b)(5) _X__ (b)(6) \n___ (b)(7)(A) ___ (b)(7)(B) __X_ (b)(7)(C) ___ (b)(7)(D) _X__ (b)(7)(E) ___ (b)(7)(F) \n___ (b)(3) Statute 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(s) \n\nPursuant to DHS Instruction 262-11-004, FOIA Officers at DHS have been instructed to withhold personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) of DHS personnel unless a determination is made that the disclosure does not raise security or privacy concerns, or if those concerns are outweighed by any public interest in that information. This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2024-027280 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \n\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \nSincerely, \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n",

According to a document released to me by the Marines through FOIA (see attached), the Marines provided support to this production. I therefore request any and all documents pertaining to Marine Corps support for \"Ronin 3.\" Such documents may include but should not be not limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the Marines and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Ronin 3,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nReference is made to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request # 1362506-000 for FBI records concerning Rafael Villaverde.  The FBI has located approximately 3,263 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-100 page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing.  Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nWe contact requesters with requests of this size to see if there might be a way to possibly narrow the scope.  Is this something you might be willing to consider?  If so, please contact me and we can discuss this possibility.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\nMs. Wilson\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nRecords Management Division\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n540-868-4894",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nATTENTION:\r\n\r\nThe Government Spying Transparency Project (GSTP) submit this expedited Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request for records of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI') pertaining to the investigation and surveillance of Muslim communities in Washington. The GSTP submit this request pursuant to the FOIA, 5 U.S.C.  \u00a7 552, implementing regulations 8 C.F.R.  \u00a7 103.10 and 6 C.F.R.  \u00a7 5 and any other applicable regulations.\r\n\r\nCommunity members, civil rights organizations, and mainstream media have reported that the FBI is surveilling and infiltrating Muslim American communities and building a dragnet that is detrimentally affecting the lives of innocent Americans. We have seen FBI spying exposed in communities in Northern California, New York and Minnesota. Muslims in Oregon routinely report being harassed and followed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We\u2019ve seen the leaks of former FBI Agent Terry Albury who exposed wide-spread unwarranted and unconstitutional surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation across the country and a culture of Islamophobia within the bureau. Former FBI Agent Terry Albury said the Federal Bureau of Investigation routinely targeted innocent and vulnerable Muslim Americans and said the Federal Bureau of Investigation ruined lives.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR INFORMATION:\r\n\r\nWe are seeking disclosure of agency records in your possession that fall within the following areas:\r\n\r\n(1)  Individual records related to FBI activities in Washington from September 11, 2001, to the present pertaining to:\r\n       \r\n      a.  FBI investigations and assessments of mosques; Islamic centers; Muslim community centers; Muslim organizations; members of mosques, Islamic centers, or Muslim community centers based on their membership or affiliation with such centers; Muslim leaders; and imams;\r\n      b.  Domain management, including but not limited to maps or other records relating to or describing \"domains;\" and records of\"concentrated ethnic communities,\" \"ethnic-oriented businesses or nonprofits\" and any other records related to \"community race and ethnicity\" analyses or assessments in the FBI \"domains\" of Washington. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\n\r\nTitle 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) provides for expedited processing of requests for information in cases in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need. By statute, for requests made by persons primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal government activity constitutes a \"compelling need.\"\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(Il). In addition, Department of Justice regulations states that FOIA requests are entitled to expedited processing when the information requested involves \"(a] matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.S(d)(l)(iv). Here, the requesters of this information are primarily engaged in disseminating information and, for reasons made clear below, there is an urgency to inform the public concerning federal government activity in connection with the FBl's investigation of Muslim communities.8 FBI activities that the instant FOIA request is intended to reveal have been widely reported, caused widespread anxiety, and raised widespread concerns about the federal government's misconduct, including racial and religious profiling and violations of the constitutional rights of United States residents, both aliens and citizens. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR WAIVER OF PROCESSING FEES UNDER FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT BECAUSE DISCLOSURE OF THE REQUESTED INFORMATION IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.\r\n\r\nWe also request a fee waiver for duplication costs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(ii)(ll)-(iii). Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. It will further public understanding of government conduct, in particular the FBl's policies, practices, and methods of surveillance including the use of informants, the use of informants in terrorism-related prosecutions, the rate at which investigations and assessments of Muslim communities result in criminal and other prosecutions. We are well situated to disseminate information gained through this request to the public, to affected communities, to organizations that protect immigrants' rights, and to political and religious organizations. If the fee waivers are denied, the requesters are prepared to pay fees up to $25, and request to be informed of further fees that may be charged, but reserve the right to appeal a denial of fee waivers. If this request for information is denied in whole or in part, we ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. We expect you to release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. We reserve the right to appeal a decision to withhold any information.\r\n\r\nBROAD INTERPRETATION OF REQUEST.\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request should be interpreted to include records maintained by FBI headquarters or any field office or task force including the Seattle FBI Field Office, Washington Joint Terrorism Task Forces, and U.S. / National Joint Terrorism Task Force but not limited to such.\r\n\r\nI affirm that the information provided supporting the request for expedited processing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJustin Acta",
