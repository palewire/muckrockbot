Duplicates from each year do not need to be completed. At a minimum, photos for 2023 - 2024 should be included. \r\n\r\nPrecedent: Santa Ana Police Department and LAPD have released their photos. A reminder that nothing in California Penal Code 832.7 mentions photographs in personnel records are kept confidential. Not only that, but videos and pictures of officers are regularly shared on social media. \r\nhttps://www.courthousenews.com/judge-tosses-las-second-lawsuit-against-journalist-over-police-headshots/\r\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-13/city-of-la-officers-city\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoey Scott",
