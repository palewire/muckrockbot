Further, \"A CIA official said the agency takes \u201cany claim of coercion, or perceived coercion, extremely seriously and fully cooperated with NIH\u2019s review of this matter, and have offered access to any information requested.\u201d Link to the CNN Article: https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/30/health/nih-havana-syndrome-study/index.html\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nI am filing this request in my role as a Board Member for Targeted Justice, Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, and a news organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLeonid Ber",

This request is submitted to both the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure a full and accurate compilation of records related to the Medicaid ABI Waiver providers.\r\nScope of Request\r\n1.\tProvider Information for Medicaid ABI Waiver Program:\r\no\tA complete list of NPI numbers, along with corresponding provider names and addresses, for all entities authorized under Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid ABI Waiver Program. This includes all providers in the Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury Approved Provider Registry managed by DSS and recognized by CMS.\r\n2.\tProvider Registry Documentation:\r\no\tAny official registries, directories, or databases maintained by CMS or DSS that list the approved ABI Waiver providers and their associated NPI numbers.\r\n\r\nPurpose and Public Interest Justification\r\nThe requested information is essential to support transparency, public accountability, and accessibility in Medicaid-funded services. Access to these records will enable stakeholders and beneficiaries to verify approved providers, ensuring that taxpayer-funded services are administered equitably and with oversight. This request serves the public interest by facilitating oversight of Medicaid resources and supporting beneficiaries in making informed provider choices.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for Request\r\nThis request is supported by state and federal laws governing public access to records and ensuring Medicaid program transparency:\r\n\u2022\tConnecticut Freedom of Information Act (C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 to 1-242): Provides public access to state-held records, including Medicaid-related data.\r\n\u2022\tConnecticut Public Records Law (Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210): Requires prompt access to public agency records, ensuring transparency for taxpayer-funded programs.\r\n\u2022\tFreedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552): Governs access to federal records, ensuring transparency and accountability for CMS-administered programs.\r\n\u2022\tSocial Security Act \u2013 Title XIX (Medicaid) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.): Mandates federal and state oversight of Medicaid-funded programs.\r\n\u2022\tConnecticut Non-Discrimination Law (Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 46a-58(a)), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794): Require that individuals with disabilities receive accommodations for full access to information, ensuring compliance in FOIA processes.\r\n\r\nDisability and Accessibility Accommodations\r\nIn accordance with ADA and Section 504 requirements, please apply the following accommodations to ensure my full access to these records:\r\n1.\tEmail-Only Communication:\r\no\tAll responses, updates, and records should be sent exclusively via email to AabiWR@live.com. No physical mail, phone calls, portal-based communications, external links, or alternative platforms are permitted.\r\n2.\tElectronic and Accessible Format:\r\no\tProvide all documents in accessible electronic formats (e.g., PDFs compatible with screen readers).\r\n3.\tComplete Documentation:\r\no\tProvide all records without redactions unless legally required. For any necessary redactions, cite the specific legal exemption applied and include a summary.\r\n4.\tDetailed Explanations for Any Denials:\r\no\tIf any portion of this request is denied, provide a clear and detailed explanation for each denied item, citing relevant statutes or exemptions.\r\n5.\tGuidance for Complex Records:\r\no\tFor records containing complex financial, legal, or procedural language, please include summaries or simplified explanations to ensure comprehension.\r\n6.\tIdentification of FOIA Officer Handling This Request:\r\no\tProvide the full name, title, and direct contact information of the FOIA officer assigned to my request. This information is necessary for transparency and documentation.\r\n7.\tConfirmation of Accommodations:\r\no\tConfirm receipt of this request and explicitly acknowledge that each accommodation listed will be fully applied in all responses and communications.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\nDue to the pressing public interest in transparency and accountability in Medicaid-funded services for vulnerable populations, I request expedited processing under Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210(a), which mandates prompt availability of public records, and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), which allows expedited FOIA processing when there is an urgent need to inform the public.\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nI request a waiver of all associated fees under Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), as this request is in the public interest and not for commercial use. The disclosure of the requested information will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of Medicaid operations and beneficiary access to services under the ABI Waiver Program.\r\nTimeline Expectation\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request within four business days as required by Connecticut FOIA laws. Additionally, I request an estimated timeline for fulfillment.\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter and for upholding transparency and accountability in Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid system.\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain.
