This request includes any emails sent to, received from, or copied (cc or bcc) to Marjorie Taylor Greene.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer to the following case laws:\r\n\r\nAtlanta Journal & Constitution v. City of Atlanta, 259 Ga. App. 818 (2003): This case held that public records requests must be granted in a reasonable amount of time under the Georgia Open Records Act.\r\n\r\nHarris v. Cox Enterprises, Inc., 256 Ga. 299 (1986): This case held that records in the possession of a public officer or agency are subject to the Open Records Act, and any exceptions to disclosure must be narrowly construed.\r\n\r\nHardaway Co. v. Rives, 262 Ga. 631 (1993): This case established that when a record is subject to disclosure, the custodian of the record must allow the requester to inspect the record without delay.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in a readable electronic format, such as PDF, and include all email attachments and metadata associated with the requested email communications.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is denied or exempt from disclosure, please cite the specific exemption and provide an index of the withheld or redacted records, as required by law.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold or delete responsive documents will be appealed in a court of law. I also request that any responsive records be provided on a rolling basis, meaning that records should be provided as they become available instead of waiting for all records to be collected before responding to the request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan",
