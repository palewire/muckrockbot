        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am writing to request access to any and all records and documents pertaining to the designers of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), specifically Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. I request that these documents be made available to me in their entirety.\r\n\r\nAs you are aware, the AES is a widely used encryption algorithm that has been adopted as a standard by the United States government and is used extensively in the private sector. Given the importance of encryption in today's society, it is imperative that the public has a better understanding of the origins and design of the AES.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to cite case law that has upheld the public's right to access government records under FOIA. Specifically, in United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), the Supreme Court held that FOIA should be interpreted liberally to promote transparency and accountability in government. Additionally, in ACLU v. U.S. Department of Defense, 628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011), the D.C. Circuit held that the public has a right to access information about the government's use of encryption technologies.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that all relevant documents are provided, I request access to any records that mention or relate to Joan Daemen, Vincent Rijmen, or the AES. This would include, but is not limited to, any communications, memoranda, reports, or other documents related to the design or development of the AES. I also request access to any metadata or other information related to the NSA's XKEYSCORE program or any other program that may be relevant to this request.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to draw your attention to the attached article entitled \"The extended Rijndael-like block ciphers\". This article provides important context and background information on the AES and its designers. I request that this article be considered as a part of my FOIA request, and that any relevant documents referenced in the article be included in my request.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I request that a keystring search be conducted for any records related to Joan Daemen, Vincent Rijmen, or the AES. Furthermore, I would like to request any records related to the NSA's Enterprise Secure Logon User Repository (ESLUR) that may pertain to the AES or its designers.\r\n\r\nFinally, I request that the NSA not withhold or redact any responsive documents, even if they have been deleted. Any redactions or withholdings must be justified under FOIA's exemptions, and I reserve the right to challenge such redactions or withholdings in court.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",

It is important to understand how the NSA may be monitoring or analyzing these memes in order to protect privacy and civil liberties.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the NSA's monitoring or analysis of internet memes, including any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to this monitoring or analysis. Additionally, I am interested in any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the NSA's use of internet memes for any purpose, including propaganda or disinformation campaigns.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting any records related to the ELSUR program, XKeyscore program, metadata collection, or any other related programs that may be used for monitoring internet traffic and communications.\r\n\r\nI want to emphasize that I do not consent to the withholding, deletion, or redaction of any responsive records or documents, except in cases where the NSA can provide a specific justification for why the records are exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Please provide me with any non-exempt records or documents in their entirety, including any segregable portions that may be released.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I hereby provide notice that any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records or documents without providing a specific justification for why they are exempt from disclosure will be met with a complaint and legal action to compel the NSA to provide access to the requested records in accordance with the FOIA.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to reference case law that affirms the public's right to access government records related to surveillance and monitoring. One key case is United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), which held that the FOIA reflects a \"general philosophy of full agency disclosure\" and that any exemptions to the FOIA must be narrowly construed. Another important case is Electronic Privacy Information Center v. National Security Agency, 678 F.3d 926 (D.C.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am requesting access to documents held by the Miami-Dade Department of Education related to books that have been banned or removed from schools due to their connection to Critical Race Theory (CRT) or their depiction of LGBTQ+ characters or themes.\r\n\r\nI want to emphasize that I do not consent to the withholding, deletion, or redaction of any responsive records or documents, except in cases where the Miami-Dade Department of Education can provide a specific justification for why the records are exempt from disclosure under the Florida Sunshine Law. Please provide me with any non-exempt records or documents in their entirety, including any segregable portions that may be released.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I hereby provide notice that any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records or documents without providing a specific justification for why they are exempt from disclosure will be met with a complaint and legal action to compel the Miami-Dade Department of Education to provide access to the requested records in accordance with the Florida Sunshine Law.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to reference case law that affirms the public's right to access government records under the Florida Sunshine Law. One key case is Times Publishing Co. v. Williams, 222 So. 2d 470 (Fla. 2d DCA 1969), which held that the public has a right to access government records and that any exemptions to the FOIA must be narrowly construed. Another important case is Board of County Commissioners of Palm Beach County v. Dain, 719 So. 2d 1063 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998), which held that a government agency must provide a specific justification for withholding or redacting information under an exemption to the FOIA.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the decision-making process behind the banning or removal of books from schools due to their connection to CRT or their depiction of LGBTQ+ characters or themes. This may include but is not limited to any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to this decision-making process.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am interested in any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to any complaints or challenges made against books due to their connection to CRT or their depiction of LGBTQ+ characters or themes. This may include but is not limited to any correspondence or communication between the Miami-Dade Department of Education and individuals or groups involved in such challenges or complaints.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am requesting a list of all books that have been banned or removed from schools in Florida due to their connection to CRT or their depiction of LGBTQ+ characters or themes. Please provide the title, author, and reason for the banning or removal of each book.\r\n\r\nIf any responsive records or documents are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide me with a justification for each exemption relied upon.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",

Mizell was a founding member of the hip-hop group Run-DMC and a pioneer in the music industry. He was tragically killed on October 30, 2002, at his recording studio in Queens, New York. I am referencing an article from Rolling Stone magazine, published on March 4, 2021, titled \"Jam Master Jay Alleged Killer Goes to Trial,\" which provides some background on the investigation into his death and the subsequent trial of his alleged killer.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), I request that all records be released to me, including any documents, memos, emails, or other materials that reference or relate to Jason William Mizell or his death. Additionally, I request that a key string search be conducted to ensure that all relevant records are provided to me. Specifically, I would like to request that the following key strings be used in the search:\r\n\r\nJam Master Jay\r\nJason Mizell\r\nRun-DMC\r\nMurder\r\nHomicide\r\nInvestigation\r\nSuspect\r\nArrest\r\nTrial\r\nEvidence\r\nWitness\r\nStatement\r\nInterview\r\nAutopsy\r\nForensic\r\nBallistics\r\nGang\r\nDrug\r\nCriminal\r\nViolence\r\nNew York City\r\nI also request any records that may be responsive to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) program.\r\n\r\nI would like to remind you that the FOIA reflects a strong presumption in favor of disclosure, and that any exemptions to the Act must be narrowly construed. The Supreme Court has held that the FOIA promotes transparency and accountability in government, and that any exemptions to the Act must be based on specific and narrowly defined grounds. See United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989); John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146 (1989); and Nat'l Archives & Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), among other cases.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would like to give notice that I do not consent to any withholding, redaction, or deletion of records that may be responsive to my request, except in cases where the documents are clearly exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please provide me with any non-exempt records or documents in their entirety, including any segregable portions that may be released.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I hereby provide notice that any attempt to withhold, redact, or delete responsive records or documents without providing a specific justification for why they are exempt from disclosure will be met with a complaint and legal action to compel the Atlanta Police Department to provide access to the requested records in accordance with the Georgia Open Records Act.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to reference the court case Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia v. Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 310 Ga. App. 613 (2011), which affirms the public's right to access government records under the Georgia Open Records Act.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am seeking any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the Atlanta Police Department's surveillance or investigation of Black Lives Matter, including any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to this surveillance or investigation. I am also requesting any communications between the Atlanta Police Department and other law enforcement agencies or government entities related to the surveillance or investigation of Black Lives Matter.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am interested in any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other documents related to the Atlanta Police Department's surveillance or investigation of any groups or individuals associated with Black Lives Matter or involved in activism related to racial justice, police reform, or other related issues. This may include but is not limited to groups such as the Movement for Black Lives, Campaign Zero, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\r\n\r\nIf any responsive records or documents are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide me with a justification for each exemption relied upon.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",

This may include complaints related to securities fraud, insider trading, or any other area over which the SEC has jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nI would like to request information on any companies owned or controlled by Donald J Trump, including but not limited to the Trump Organization, Trump Foundation, and Trump International Hotels. Please include any and all relevant communications, documents, or other materials related to complaints filed against these entities or their representatives.\r\n\r\nTo support my request, I would like to cite several relevant court cases, including SEC v. Trump, 279 F. Supp. 2d 340 (S.D.N.Y. 2003), SEC v. Trump, 2020 WL 4044162 (S.D.N.Y. July 17, 2020), and SEC v. Trump, 2021 WL 1520177 (S.D.N.Y. April 19, 2021). These cases demonstrate the importance of transparency and accountability in the securities industry, and underscore the need for disclosure of relevant complaints and information.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to provide notice that any withholding or deletion of responsive records without a lawful basis will result in my pursuit of legal action and complaint to the appropriate authorities. As you are aware, FOIA requires agencies to disclose all non-exempt records in response to a request within a reasonable time frame, and any failure to do so would constitute a violation of the law.\r\n\r\nPlease provide any responsive records to this request on a rolling basis, as they become available.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Additionally, I would like to request any emails sent to or from the domain polksheriff.org, including any recipients in the \"To,\" \"From,\" \"CC,\" or \"BCC\" fields.\r\n\r\nPlease provide any responsive records for the last 5 years, dating from April 5, 2018 to April 5, 2023.\r\n\r\nAs per Florida Public Records Law, agencies are required to provide access to public records unless the records are exempted by law. If any responsive documents contain exempt information, please provide me with the remaining non-exempt portions of the records, and redact or withhold the exempt information.\r\n\r\nI would like to remind you that under Florida law, agencies have an obligation to disclose records and not to withhold or redact information that can be reasonably segregated and not subject to exemption. If you withhold or redact any information that should have been released or provide an inadequate response, I will be forced to take legal action and file a complaint in court.\r\n\r\nI would like to point out some relevant local court cases to support my request. The Florida Supreme Court in Times Publishing Co. v. City of St. Petersburg, 558 So. 2d 487, 493 (Fla. 1990) held that the Public Records Law must be construed liberally in favor of open access to public records, and that exemptions must be strictly construed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal in State v. City of Deerfield Beach, 426 So. 2d 1332, 1336 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983) emphasized that agencies have a duty to search all of their files for responsive records, and cannot limit their search to only certain files or categories.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",

Mayor Adams served with the department from 1984 to 2006. I am requesting the following records under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL):\r\n\r\nAll records related to disciplinary actions taken against Eric Adams during his time with the New York City Police Department, including disciplinary files and logs.\r\n\r\nAny and all records related to changes, edits, and copies of the responsive documents identified in item 1 above.\r\n\r\nA list of all individuals who had access to the records identified in items 1 and 2 above during Eric Adams' tenure with the New York City Police Department.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the public, I have a right to access these records to gain a better understanding of the professional conduct and performance of now Mayor Eric Adams during his time with the New York City Police Department.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold, redact, or destroy information related to this request will result in legal action and complaint. The failure to comply with FOIL is a serious matter and can result in both criminal and civil penalties. Therefore, I strongly urge you to comply with this request in a timely and complete manner.\r\n\r\nLast, I would like to bring to your attention the case law supporting my request:\r\n\r\nNew York City Administrative Code Section 14-151 (a) requires the New York Police Department to maintain records of all complaints and allegations of police misconduct, including records of investigations and findings.\r\n\r\nNew York State Committee on Open Government, Advisory Opinion #2016-4 (2016) states that police body-worn camera footage is presumptively available under FOIL.\r\n\r\nMatter of Fappiano v.

Garcia, Timothy J. Burke, and Patrick L.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am writing to request any and all records related to threats made against Senator Dianne Feinstein and her husband, including but not limited to the following:\r\n\r\nDocuments, memos, or reports related to threats made against Senator Feinstein and her husband, including those obtained through the use of electronic surveillance (ELSUR) and keystring searches;\r\n\r\nSocial media posts, comments, or messages related to threats made against Senator Feinstein and her husband;\r\n\r\nFollow-up investigations conducted by the FBI or any other law enforcement agency in relation to these threats, including any interagency searches.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the search for these records, I suggest using the following keystring search terms:\r\n\r\nDianne Feinstein\r\nRichard Blum\r\nThreats\r\nHarassment\r\nIntimidation\r\nViolence\r\nAssault\r\n\r\nGiven the potentially large scope of this request, I respectfully request that the FBI provide any responsive records on a rolling basis, as they become available. This will help ensure that I receive responsive records in a timely manner and allow me to more effectively manage and prioritize the review of the records.To the extent that records are withheld or redacted, I ask that you provide the specific legal basis for the withholding or redaction, and that you provide any segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. In addition, I remind you that FOIA requires agencies to produce records in their entirety, even if portions of the records are exempt from disclosure. See, e.g., Bevis v. Department of State, 801 F.2d 1386, 1389 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (stating that an agency must \"release all reasonably segregable portions of [the] record\").\r\n\r\nI also remind you that FOIA requires agencies to disclose records even if they have been deleted or improperly redacted. See, e.g., Payne Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 486, 488 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (stating that an agency must \"conduct a reasonable search for records, and cannot limit its search to only those records that it believes to be intact\").\r\n\r\nIf any records responsive to this request have been destroyed, deleted, or otherwise disposed of, I ask that you provide the following information:\r\n\r\nThe date and circumstances of the disposal or destruction;\r\n\r\nThe name, title, and position of the person who authorized the disposal or destruction;\r\n\r\nThe name, title, and position of the person or persons responsible for carrying out the disposal or destruction;\r\n\r\nThe procedures that were followed for disposing of or destroying the records; and\r\n\r\nA description of the records that were destroyed or disposed of.\r\n\r\nFinally, I remind you that FOIA provides for attorney's fees and litigation costs to be awarded to a prevailing plaintiff. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E). Therefore, I urge you to comply fully with this request and to respond within the statutory time frame.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am writing to request access to and copies of all documents, emails, and any other information in the possession of the New York State Police and their Counter Terrorism Unit related to threats made against Governor Kathy Hochul, including emails and tips received by the police, electronic surveillance, and any documents or memos related to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), from her Inauguration on August 24, 2021 to the present. This request includes metadata associated with the records, such as author, date, and time of creation.\r\n\r\nAs a requester, I would like to bring to your attention that it is crucial to read this request carefully and provide the requested information in a complete and accurate manner. Failure to do so may result in legal action, including filing a complaint with the New York State Committee on Open Government or a court of law, in order to compel the production of the requested records.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that this request is properly processed, I ask that you carefully review the details of this request, including the scope of documents and information being requested, the timeframe for the requested records, and the specific key string searches to be conducted. If any clarification is needed, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent reports have indicated that Governor Hochul has received numerous threats of violence and harm since taking office, including on social media platforms such as Twitter. As a concerned citizen and advocate for transparency, I request access to any documents, emails, or other information in the possession of the New York State Police and their Counter Terrorism Unit that relate to these threats, including any information gathered through electronic surveillance or other investigative methods.\r\n\r\nTo assist in the search for responsive records, I request that the following keystring searches be conducted:\r\n\r\n\"Kathy Hochul\"\r\n\"Governor Hochul\"\r\n\"threats\"\r\n\"violence\"\r\n\"harm\"\r\n\"social media\"\r\n\"Twitter\"\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that this request includes not only records related to direct threats against Governor Hochul, but also any records related to the New York State Police's response to such threats, including any investigations, protective measures, or communications with other law enforcement agencies or government entities. The Counter Terrorism Unit is included in this request due to their expertise in responding to threats against public officials.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is denied or exempt from disclosure, please cite the specific exemption and provide an index of the withheld or redacted records, as required by law.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold or delete responsive documents will be appealed in a court of law. Any such actions may result in legal proceedings to compel the production of the records and any applicable penalties. I also request that any responsive records be provided on a rolling basis, meaning that records should be provided as they become available instead of waiting for all records to be collected before responding to the request.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer to the following court cases and legal principles:\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Law (FOIL), Public Officers Law Article 6: This law requires the government to provide access to records maintained by government entities.\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004): This case held that FOIA requires agencies to disclose records unless the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption.\r\n\r\nNewsday LLC v. Empire State Development Corporation, 98 A.D.3d 36, 944 N.Y.S.2d 78 (2d Dept. 2012): This case held that \"an agency must identify which exemption(s) it asserts to justify withholding the requested information, and state in a conclusory fashion how the exemption applies to the particular documents or parts thereof.\"\r\n\r\nMatter of Johnson v. N.Y. State Police, 196 A.D.2d 794, 601 N.Y.S.2d 64 (3d Dept. 1993): This case held that \"an agency cannot simply deny access to documents or information sought under FOIL by invoking a statutory exemption; rather, the agency has the burden of demonstrating that the exemption applies to the material in question.\"\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan",

The request was for \"Threats made against Gov Kathy Hochul\".\r\nYour request has been forwarded to the appropriate program area(s) to identify documents that are responsive to your request, and which may be made available pursuant to all applicable provisions of the Freedom of Information Law.\r\nA determination as to whether your request is granted or denied will be reached on or before June 7, 2023, or we will notify you in writing if the responsible program area(s) should require additional time to locate, assemble and review documents that may be responsive to your request.\r\nPlease note that, pursuant to Article 6 of the Public Officers Law, a charge may be applied to your request, including the actual cost of the medium used to respond to your Freedom of Information Law request and/or other related costs.  When responsive records have been identified, you will be informed of any cost and how payment should be made.\r\nPLEASE NOTE: **\r\nAs we have acknowledged your request, please refrain from submitting duplicate requests for the same records through Open FOIL.  Submitting a duplicate request takes time away from processing the hundreds of requests received each month.
