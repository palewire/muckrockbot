I am aware of prior requests, including those in *Roman v. Dep't of the Air Force, No. 12-1381 (EGS) (D.D.C. 2013)*, which sought locations of HAARP devices and test dates. To avoid duplication, I seek only records created, declassified, or otherwise made available after July 9, 2013, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Documents related to the transfer of HAARP facilities or operations to the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2015 or later, including agreements, environmental impact assessments, and declassification reviews.\r\n2. Reports, memoranda, emails, or cables concerning HAARP's goals, scope, testing dates, or additional facilities (beyond the known Gakona, Alaska site) from 2013 to the present, including any segregable portions of classified records.\r\n3. Records referenced in the George W. Bush Presidential Library finding aid for FOIA 2014-0038-F, such as drafts of the U.S. Arctic Research Plan Biennial Revision: 2004\u20132008, or electronic records (e.g., TS emails from 2001-2008) that have been declassified and transferred to Air Force custody.\r\n4. Any indexes, Vaughn lists, or descriptions of records withheld in the *Roman* case, including updates on their classification status post-2013.\r\n5. Communications between the Air Force and other agencies (e.g., DARPA, Navy, NSF) regarding HAARP operations, funding, or research after 2013.\r\n\r\nIf responsive records are classified or otherwise exempt from disclosure, please: (1) conduct a declassification review under Executive Order 13526; (2) release any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions; and (3) provide a detailed explanation, including applicable FOIA exemptions (e.g., 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)), along with a Vaughn index describing each withheld document.\r\n\r\nI request a fee waiver, as disclosure is in the public interest, contributing to understanding government research programs and transparency in ionospheric studies. If fees apply, please notify me in advance if they exceed $25.\r\n\r\nPlease provide records in electronic format (PDF) via email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
