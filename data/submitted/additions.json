Iowa Department of Corrections had helped to provide a list of all offenders on probation and parole. I would like to be able to cross reference that list with the current Iowa SOR to pull the data I am seeking. I would like to request that the Division provide the list of offenders on the SOR currently. \r\n\r\nIf that request is not possible, I wonder if the Division has: the exact number of people who are 1) on both the sex offender registry and probation; and 2) on both the sex offender registry and parole; as per the latest available data is requested.\r\n\r\nIf another agency has this data, I request the name of that agency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nWendy Sawyer",
