Also all device serial numbers, device services providers, device ip addresses, device MAC addresses, device telephone numbers, device email addresses, and any other device specific identifying and device specific location information.\r\n\r\nAlso include any usage logs for the devices, device audit logs, as well as any reports of any theft of or misuse of the access devices including complaints or allegations of online/internet misconduct, hacking, or harassment/bullying of any kind in association with the use of any of these internet access devices provided by your agency in 2020.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Musgrave:\r\n\r\nThis responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for a copy\r\nof DODIG-2016-098, Evaluation of Foreign Officer Involvement at the United\r\nStates Special Operations Command.  We received your request on May 16, 2017\r\nand assigned it case number DODOIG-2017-000595.\r\n\r\n\tThe Evaluations component conducted a search and located records\r\nresponsive to your request.  In coordination with U.S. Special Operations\r\nCommand (USSOCOM) and the Office of Secretary of Defense/Joint Staff, we\r\ndetermined that the attached report, totaling 144 pages, is appropriate for\r\nrelease in part pursuant to the following FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) exemptions: \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(1), which pertains to information that is currently and properly\r\nclassified pursuant to Executive Order 13526, sections: \r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(a), military plans, weapon systems, or operations; \r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(d), foreign relations or foreign activities of the\r\nUnited States, including confidential sources;\r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(g), vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems,\r\ninstallations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services\r\nrelating to the national security; and\r\n\r\n\to\t1.7(e), compilations of items of information that are\r\nindividually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information\r\nreveals an additional association or relationship that: (1) meets the\r\nstandards for classification under this order; and (2) is not otherwise\r\nrevealed in the individual items of information. \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(3), which pertains to information exempted from release by\r\nstatute, in this instance, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130(b) \u0096 Personally identifiable\r\ninformation pertaining to members of the armed forces assigned to \"routinely\r\ndeployable unit[s]\" and certain employees of DOD and DHS. \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(5), which protects privileged communications within or between\r\nagencies, including those protected by the deliberative process privilege.\r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(6), which pertains to information, the release of which would\r\nconstitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. \r\n\r\nOur review included consideration of the foreseeable harm standard, as\r\nstated in DoDM 5400.07.  Under this standard, the content of a particular\r\nrecord should be reviewed and a determination made as to whether the DoD\r\nComponent reasonably foresees that disclosing it, given its age, content,\r\nand character, would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this an adverse determination, you may submit an appeal.\r\nYour appeal, if any, must be postmarked within 90 days of the date of this\r\nletter, clearly identify the determination that you would like to appeal,\r\nand reference to the FOIA case number above.  Send your appeal to the\r\nDepartment of Defense, Office of Inspector General, ATTN: FOIA Appellate\r\nAuthority, Suite 10B24, 4800 Mark Center Drive, Alexandria, VA 22350-1500,\r\nor via facsimile to 571-372-7498.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Musgrave:\r\n\r\nThis responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for a copy\r\nof DODIG-2016-098, Evaluation of Foreign Officer Involvement at the United\r\nStates Special Operations Command.  We received your request on June 24,\r\n2016, and assigned it case number FOIA-2016-00787.\r\n\r\n\tThe Evaluations component conducted a search and located records\r\nresponsive to your request.  In coordination with U.S. Special Operations\r\nCommand (USSOCOM) and the Office of Secretary of Defense/Joint Staff, we\r\ndetermined that the attached report, totaling 144 pages, is appropriate for\r\nrelease in part pursuant to the following FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) exemptions: \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(1), which pertains to information that is currently and properly\r\nclassified pursuant to Executive Order 13526, sections: \r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(a), military plans, weapon systems, or operations; \r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(d), foreign relations or foreign activities of the\r\nUnited States, including confidential sources;\r\n\r\n\to\t1.4(g), vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems,\r\ninstallations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services\r\nrelating to the national security; and\r\n\r\n\to\t1.7(e), compilations of items of information that are\r\nindividually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information\r\nreveals an additional association or relationship that: (1) meets the\r\nstandards for classification under this order; and (2) is not otherwise\r\nrevealed in the individual items of information. \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(3), which pertains to information exempted from release by\r\nstatute, in this instance, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130(b) \u0096 Personally identifiable\r\ninformation pertaining to members of the armed forces assigned to \"routinely\r\ndeployable unit[s]\" and certain employees of DOD and DHS. \r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(5), which protects privileged communications within or between\r\nagencies, including those protected by the deliberative process privilege.\r\n\r\n\u0095\t(b)(6), which pertains to information, the release of which would\r\nconstitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. \r\n\r\nOur review included consideration of the foreseeable harm standard, as\r\nstated in DoDM 5400.07.  Under this standard, the content of a particular\r\nrecord should be reviewed and a determination made as to whether the DoD\r\nComponent reasonably foresees that disclosing it, given its age, content,\r\nand character, would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this an adverse determination, you may submit an appeal.\r\nYour appeal, if any, must be postmarked within 90 days of the date of this\r\nletter, clearly identify the determination that you would like to appeal,\r\nand reference to the FOIA case number above.  Send your appeal to the\r\nDepartment of Defense, Office of Inspector General, ATTN: FOIA Appellate\r\nAuthority, Suite 10B24, 4800 Mark Center Drive, Alexandria, VA 22350-1500,\r\nor via facsimile to 571-372-7498.

These are listed as subject to FOIL under OCA's list of FOILable subject material accessible at https://www.nycourts.gov/LegacyPDFS/Foil/Foil-subjectMatter-List.pdf\r\nPlease be advised that judicial training materials fall within the intra/inter agency exemption (Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g)). The training materials are utilized within the Unified Court System only, by an account and password for personnel. They generally consist of materials drafted by Judges, legal staff of Judges, agencies, institutions, and private organizations and fall within the intra/inter agency exemption to FOIL, where they consist of subjective materials, research, opinions, advice, and analysis of the personnel, staff, agencies, institutions, and private organizations presented for discussion purposes. The discussion materials do not reflect final policy decisions, nor constitute final instructions to staff. Rather they reflect the subjective views, analysis, research, opinions, and recommendations of the author/presenter, to assist in a discussion and deliberation of the topics.\r\n\r\nTo the extent the materials also may provide insight into the deliberative and analytical processes of the Judges, the materials would be privileged.  See \u00a7 87(2)(a); CPLR \u00a7 3101(b).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, they may reflect protecting privileged communications or work product of attorneys and would be exempt under Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(a); CPLR \u00a7 3101(b), (c); CPLR \u00a7 4503.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, please note that the Subject Matter List is a current list of records, by subject matter, that are maintained by this agency. Some of the listed records may be exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Law.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(4)(a), you have thirty (30) days to take a written appeal of this determination.

Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format.

If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nErin Stewart \r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice \r\n(617) 338-1050 \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

See A Guide to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, p. 32, n.115.\u00a0 It is expected that a custodian of records must use her superior knowledge of her records with respect to responses to public records requests.\u00a0 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u00a0 Specifically, you stated: \r\nTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken.

This is an opportunity to\r\nreview the project goals and ask any questions about the RFP. \r\n\r\nThe pre-proposal meeting will be held remotely over Zoom. Please follow\r\nthis Link\r\n\r\nto join the Zoom meeting.

This grant will help the\r\nCity to:\r\n\r\n* Develop regulations or procedures to expedite approvals for a\r\nsignificant portion of development proposals. This includes a separate,\r\nnon-discretionary permit review of projects that are consistent with the\r\nCity of Oakland's General Plan and Planning Code.\r\n\r\n* Prepare Objective Design Standards to streamline processing for a\r\nvariety of proposals, especially affordable housing and projects near\r\nBART and along major transit corridors.\r\n\r\nThe objective design standards will be applied broadly to projects\r\nconsisting of a wide array of building types throughout the City of\r\nOakland. Creation of the objective design standards for\r\nnon-housing-related projects will come from a separate funding source.\r\n\r\nThe desired consultant team will include one or more multi-disciplinary\r\nplanning and design firm(s) with expertise in the following areas:\r\ndeveloping objective design standards in ethnically, linguistically and\r\nculturally diverse communities; creating programs and processes that\r\nexpedite project review; practicing historic preservation planning; and\r\nengaging the local community and stakeholders in a participatory\r\nplanning process. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease visit Objective Design Standards website\r\nfor more\r\ninformation about the RFP and the project.\r\n\r\nDEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS:\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0Friday, November 19, 2021 by 2:00 pm PST via iSupplier\r\n\r\nNOTE: Interested consultants must Register with iSupplier\r\n(the City\r\nof Oakland's procurement portal) to submit a proposal. \r\n\r\nInterested in partnership opportunities?\r\nFill out our Expression of Interest form\r\n\r\nto be identified as a firm interested in collaborating with other\r\nfirm(s) and to download the RFP.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3.

See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

A search of District records using the reference terms \"building\r\nambassadors and/or building-level ambassadors and/or Quality Remote\r\nTraining and/or QRT\" within the requested 18 month time period yielded\r\nthousands of results.

Should the requestor continue to be interested in\r\npursuing this information, the FOIL request should be updated to narrow the\r\nfield of inquiry.\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n\r\nJohn P.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Good Afternoon,\r\n\r\nPlease see Kent School District's clarifying questions to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following financial records for all schools under the authority of the school district:\r\n- Acquaintance Roll (or salary and employment information by any other name)\r\n\r\nKSD Comment:  \"Acquaintance Roll\" is not a term we are familiar with.  We can help present salary information, as we have access to that.  Clarification would be good:\r\n\r\n  *   Would they require amounts in aggregate for the year, or individual monthly pay?\r\n     *   What is the objective?  If simply overall pay, we might suggest information in the aggregate.\r\n     *   Does the information need to be broken down by person?\r\n     *   Payroll information can be quite nebulous, with many different categories of pay, deductions, and expenses.  Are they needing that much detail?\r\n  *   What time periods are they requesting?\r\n\r\n- The Cash Book (or record of all financial transactions by any other name, specifically including COVID relief funds accounting)\r\n\r\nKSD Comment:  \"Cash Book\" is not a term we are familiar with.  We could provide information on all cash we have received, if this is what is being requested, but this can be very detailed.  Also, is money going out a part of this request?  Clarification would be good:\r\n\r\n  *   For money in -- Do they require the information by each party paying us or would they like to see the information by types of cash received (revenue types in the aggregate)?\r\n  *   Revenue in the aggregate would take much less time than information by individuals.\r\n  *   For money out - are they looking for more than just an aggregation?  If detailed transactions were needed, this data would be voluminous.  One can imagine if $450 million is spent each year, how voluminous this might be; i.e., millions of transactions, possibly.\r\n  *   What time periods are they requesting?\r\n  *   COVID relief fund accounting is not too much of a burden, but do they want that down to the transaction level, or in the aggregate?\r\n\r\n- Contingencies Register\r\n\r\nAre you looking for what obligations we may have in the future to pay, we could interpret this as what we call \"encumbrances\" or are you looking for what we call \"accounts payable\".  Accounts payable information is what is owed to vendors and can be provided by vendor name, or in the aggregate, by the type of payment.  Further clarification is definitely needed here.\r\n\r\n  *   What time period is being requested?\r\n\r\n- Fee Collection Register\r\n\r\nWe would surmise this would be a published list of what fees we are charging our students for education, is this interpretation correct? Additionally, what time period is being requested?\r\n\r\n- Register of Donations Received\r\n\r\nDo you want this by person and individual instance, or in the aggregate?  In addition, this could be considered part of the \"Cash Book\" request.\r\n\r\n  *   What time period is being requested?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Register of Scholarships\r\n\r\nAre you interested in what activity there has been for scholarships we manage; i.e., money received and disbursed?\r\n\r\n  *   What time period is being requested?\r\n\r\n- Budget records for the last 5 years\r\n\r\nThis is very nebulous and further clarification is needed,  Literally, every record generated from a finance standpoint has to do with budget. Please clarify why type of  budget records you are seeking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D8C778.DE4AB2F0]<https://us-east-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=kent.k12.wa.us&u=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZW50LmsxMi53YS51cy8=&e=bGJyYXppbGVAa3Vvdy5vcmc=&h=d6ef8f34c41045f7a123e0f865a2f995&t=bnZCSVU5eEZ0Uy9VSlJ3eG5kU3VUdFBSN3NqWFl3MXBHQ2ZYWVBRMUhVRT0=>\r\nTyler Inboden (She/Her)\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nSuperintendent's Office | Kent School District<https://us-east-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=kent.k12.wa.us&u=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZW50LmsxMi53YS51cy8=&e=bGJyYXppbGVAa3Vvdy5vcmc=&h=d6ef8f34c41045f7a123e0f865a2f995&t=bnZCSVU5eEZ0Uy9VSlJ3eG5kU3VUdFBSN3NqWFl3MXBHQ2ZYWVBRMUhVRT0=>\r\n12033 SE 256th Street, A-100, Kent, WA 98030-6503\r\nO: (253) 373-7218 | Tyler.Inboden@kent.k12.wa.us<mailto:Tyler.Inboden@kent.k12.wa.us>\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

The black box may be small or large depending on the amount of information that is redacted. There may also be multiple redactions on one page. Within the redaction is a \"tag\" - for example: \"03-SSN/DLN.\" That tag designates the statutory exemption applicable to the redacted information. \r\nAlso provided with these records is an Exemption Key to these tags. This key identifies the basis for the exemption as well as a brief explanation for why the exemption applies to the redacted information. As you review these responsive documents, you can refer to the key to identify the exemption and its applicability. We've attempted to apply clear explanations for the redactions made. In the event you locate documents that contain redactions that you would like further explanation about, please let us know. \r\nAt this time, the Kirkland Police Records Unit believes it has fulfilled your request and it has now been closed. \r\nIf staff has misinterpreted any part of your request, please advise as soon as possible, as it is the intent of staff to fully comply with RCW 42.56 in a timely manner.\u00a0 We refer you to Kirkland Public Records Act (PRA) Rule 160 and RCW 42.56.550 concerning your rights to petition the City to internally review its decision to apply any and all exemptions.\u00a0 Additionally, you may also submit a new request for these records at a later date at which point the cited exemption may no longer be applicable. \r\nShould you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact Police Records at (425) 587-3481 or by responding to this email. \u00a0Respectfully, \r\n\r\nKirkland Police Records Staff \r\n\r\n11750 NE 118th Street\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 Kirkland, Washington 98034-7114\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 425.587.3481\u00a0 \u2022 www.kirklandwa.gov (www.kirklandwa.gov)",

Specifically, responsive records regarding your request for \"all problem gaming plans submitted by mobile sports wagering operators\" are included online within the publicly available application materials submitted by Operators to the Commission<https://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Procurement/RFA%20Mobile%20Sports%20Wagering%20Application%20Licensee2.pdf>. This includes materials from Applicants who were ultimately selected for licensure as well as those entities that applied but were not selected. For your convenience, we have uploaded 32 responsive records from the applications that include language addressing the issue of responsible gaming/problem gambling via the Muckrock online portal.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

I am freelance writer who has previously written about the government and its activities for MuckRock, Motherboard, Unicorn Riot, AND Magazine and Glomar Disclosure. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. My work has been further discussed in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. My primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above regarding the subject and how I will apply the information), a fee waiver is warranted.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

Producing over 5,500+ complaints would put an undue burden on the agency.  You can also reduce the date range of the complaints you are requesting and reduce the scope of your request (by reducing some of the companies you are seeking complaints about).\r\n\r\nComplaints are categorized by various issues (i.e. billing, availability, equipment, unwanted calls, indecency, interference, closed captioning, etc.).    Maybe you can also further reduce the scope of your request by narrowing it to one of the various issues.\r\n\r\nPlease give me a call on 202 418 2869 if you would like to discuss your request for clarification via telephone.  If we don't hear back from you by December 5, 2022, we will assume you are no longer interested in pursuing your FOIA request, therefore, it will be closed.  You may file a new request at any.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMike Hennigan\r\nConsumer Policy Division\r\nConsumer & Governmental Affairs Bureau\r\n202-418-2869",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have completed our review of your request to the Los Angeles Police Department (\u201cLAPD\u201d or \u201cDepartment\u201d) under the California Public Records Act (Cal. Govt. Code section 6250, et seq., hereinafter the \u201cCPRA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) seeking the following:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"Information on all hate crimes occuring in the city of jurisdiction from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2020. The information should include (although not be restricted to) the following: date-of-occurrence (YYYY-MM-DD), time-of-occurrence (HH:MM), description of crime committed, location information at the finest geographic level available (street address or block), beat, district, weapon used, bias motivation (e.g., Anti-Black/Anti-Gay/Anti-Transgender), number of suspect(s), number of victim(s), injuries incurred, suspect(s) race, victim(s) race, victim(s) sex, suspect(s) sex, victim(s) age, suspect(s) age.\"\u00a0[sic]\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 6254(b); 6254(c); 6254(f); 6254(k); and 6255.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA responsive document has been provided to you, pertaining to hate crime data from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2020, including column fields for date and time of occurrence, report number (\"DR_NBR\"), area, reporting district, description of crime committed, bias motivation, weapon used, party (suspect, victim, arrestee, or involved party), party sequence (the ordinal number of suspect(s) and victim(s) for each incident), and the suspects' and victims' sex, descent (which includes race), and ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the requested location information, you may cross-reference the provided report numbers (\"DR_NBR\") in Column D of the responsive document with the crime data publicly available on the City's Open Data portal. By doing so, this eliminates the need to review each individual incident location for confidentiality and privacy exemptions; therefore, no redactions were necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen Data may be accessed at the following links:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCity of LA Crime Data from 2010 to 2019:\r\n\r\nhttps://click.pstmrk.it/2tsm/data.lacity.org%2FPublic-Safety%2FCrime-Data-from-2010-to-2019%2F63jg-8b9z/BslxBDYN/DbEk/nT4J0d7bs9/cmVxdWVzdGVyX3JlcXVlc3RfY2xvc2Vk\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCity of LA Crime Data from 2020 to Present:\r\n\r\nhttps://click.pstmrk.it/2tsm/data.lacity.org%2FPublic-Safety%2FCrime-Data-from-2020-to-Present%2F2nrs-mtv8/B8lxBDYN/DbEk/HaDrkNE_bk/cmVxdWVzdGVyX3JlcXVlc3RfY2xvc2Vk\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe location information in Open Data has already been reviewed for public release.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWithin each link above, data can be viewed by clicking \"View Data.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWithin each Dataset, the\u00a0Filter\u00a0function can be used to filter for\u00a0the reporting number (DR_NO) and MO Codes (Mocodes).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor example, the following filter may be used to ascertain location information from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2019:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdd a New Filter Condition, from the drop-down select:\r\n\r\nDR_NO\u00a0-&gt; contains\r\n\r\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[DR_NBR]\u00a0from the responsive document provided (Column D).\r\n\r\nConfirm the small box to the left of the search term box is checked.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the alternative, you may also filter by MO Code (0903 &amp; 0921):\r\n\r\nAdd a New Filter Condition, from the drop-down select:\r\n\r\nMocodes\u00a0-&gt; contains\r\n\r\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[0903]\u00a0or\r\n\r\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[0921]\r\n\r\nConfirm the small box to the left of the search term box is checked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may download the datasets via the \"Export\" function for easier cross-referencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA manual for deciphering codes used in the dataset has been provided to you, titled \"CCADMANUAL2019_121819.pdf.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",
