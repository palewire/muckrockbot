While I appreciate the provided documents, the response falls short of the specific information I requested.\r\n\r\nIn my original request, I specifically asked for a complete list of all employees, their job titles, and their annual salaries for the last three years (2020 to 2023), as well as training documents. The documents I received only included general job titles and salaries and did not include the requested training documents. Specific employee names and their respective salaries were omitted. \r\n\r\nThis absence of information does not satisfy the requirements of my original request. As per the Freedom of Information Law (Article 6, Sections 84-90, of the Public Officers Law), I am entitled to access this public information.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as stated in NY Committee on Open Government Advisory Opinion, FOIL-AO-19074, \"[...] records identifying public employees, their public employment history, and the salaries they receive are generally available to the public, for they are required to be maintained by an agency pursuant to law.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request that you reconsider your decision and provide the complete and specific information I originally requested. If the decision is upheld, I request an explanation for the reasons behind the decision, specifically detailing the FOIA exemptions applied to withhold this information.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response to this appeal within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(ii)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\nPhone: 1-845-748-0329",

        "communication": "Dear Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nThis request covers every Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc., that has a Chief FOIA Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, or substantially equivalent position. See \"# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\" below.\r\n\r\nAt your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7). \r\n \r\nIn particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is part of an all-agency FOIA audit. Your performance will be tracked, analyzed, and published.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful patterns or practices discovered in the course of this audit will be highlighted for public shaming, and will likely be litigated for permanent injunctions.\r\n\r\nAny particularly good performance will, by the same token, be highlighted for public praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Primary request\r\n\r\nA. FOIA case log in electronic system\r\n\r\nI hereby request:\r\n\r\n1. The entire FOIA case log, for the entire period covered by the FOIA office's current electronic FOIA case tracking system.\r\n\r\n### \r\nFiat Fiendum FOIA template \r\nVersion 5.1\r\n###\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n5.1: Updated 508 provisions to refer to Access Board's final rule, 82 FR 5790, and reference https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov .\r\n\r\n# FOIA template structure\r\n\r\nAll content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, \u00a7 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  \r\n\r\nPlease read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Template version updates\r\n\r\nIf you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional FOIA requests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\"All parts of the record\" means that the \"record\" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:\r\na) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);\r\nb) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;\r\nc) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;\r\nd) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; \r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Related database records\" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 2\", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"[Alice's cell #]\". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1. See https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov/ .\r\n\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\n\u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",

If that request of years is to complicated please reduce it a reasonable timeframe to the current date. \r\n\r\nI request a copy of any records/data held on all the identifiable sex offenders for years 2012 through 2023 on record for life sentences  to report at the Ohio Electronic Sex Offender Registration and Notification Database and/or at the Ohio Attorney General  and/or the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation. If the request for the records/data has an  extensive timeframe you may narrow the search of the records/data of the sex offenders with life sentences to the years feasible to complete the request of FOIA and/or Privacy Act of 1974.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Ohio Supervisor of Public Record laws.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B2 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your agency provided substantially similar data in 2022. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

These are reports where personnel have reached out to Shotspotter for support, because the system failed to detect a shooting or misclassified an incident.  According to ShotSpotter, their best practices include steps to ensure that if police officers conclude the ShotSpotter alert was indeed a \u201cfalse positive,\u201d they report that the company to \"keep track and take remedial steps to minimize false positives in the future\".  I am looking for any such feedback given to ShotSpotter. \r\n\r\n- Any emails between department staff with the words \"false positive\" and \"Shotspotter\" or \"shot spotter\" or \"sound thinking\". Responsive records should be from 2018 until the date this request is processed.\r\n\r\n-  Copies of all SoundThinking (Shotspotter) responses to aforementioned notification reports,  Responsive records should be from 2018 until the date this request is processed.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print.

IF we could get the first part of the request accomplished, the second one is fine to take more than three days, particularly during the holiday period we are entering. \r\n\r\n1. Call 23017731 - Please provide details and records on any other calls, investigations, reports, logs, notes, bookings or contact reports, complaints or other data for Police Department or Sheriff's Office to the Carpenter Wilderness trailhead area, the addresses adjacent to or bordering 1050 Lebanon, or responses that were made within 400 yards either side on or around that date and time. -- this one is important, and yes I would like a copy of the audio and if there was any officer camera footage, please archive that and let me know the cost. \r\n\r\n2, This call may have occurred the same day from multiple parties, or there may have been other complaints filed nonemergency which is why I wanted other information about the vicinity geographically about the park. Because there is a potential for Carpenter Trails to be considered an 'attractive nuisance' I was curious about establishing a baseline of complaints and complaint types for the vicinity of the trailhead, the park, and also the 1050 Lebanon Rd. address. I am familiar with geofencing and use of ArcGIS / QGIS for establishing a query based on geography so I requested a buffer around the park of 400 yards for the calls. It's perfectly okay for this part of the FOIA / CORA to take longer than three days, and in fact, I would say that I expect to hear \"The Cortez Police Department is extending the time to respond to this request due to the extenuating circumstances of searching for the data requested through a geographical reference method across several years in time...\" with an estimate if possible to set expectations.\r\n\r\n So, for part 2 no issues with it taking a reasonable amount of time to research. With part 1, if we could expedite the audio recording of the initial call in from Rachael Marchbanks on April 29, 2023,  Call 23017731, I would be ever so grateful because it would expedite my research and query into the matter. It's okay to provide updates as they come in rather than simply await it all to be aggregated, in fact I would appreciate it being provided via digital as you obtain it. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter",

If this has nothing to do with an accident report, would the policy preclude omitting the requestor's personal identifiers such as DOB and Driver's License? Please check on this to ensure that there is no statute that precludes release of information to media without personally identifiable information also being released of the requestor. \r\n\r\nIf we are able to eliminate this requirement, I can get MuckRock to finish the form fillout and we can proceed. \r\n\r\nThanks, Merry Christmas, \r\n\r\nCharles",

After that time, the link will automatically be disabled.\r\n\r\nYour request is now fulfilled and is closed, please do not hesitate to reach-out to me if you have any issues accessing your responsive records or have any questions for the Records Office.\r\n\r\nI hope you have a great weekend and a happy new year!\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D9D75C.0B691760]\r\n\r\nNicole Peterson (She/Her)\r\nProgram Specialist 3\r\n1111 Israel Rd.

Thank you, Andrew Free #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative Al Otro Lado.
