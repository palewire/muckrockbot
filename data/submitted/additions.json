        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Department of State (DOS) records, documents, and communications responsive to Project Brain Wave, aka Operation Brain Wave. This was a program proposed and implemented by the DOS between 1950 and 1955. An undated memorandum sent by someone within the DOS to the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council states: \"10. 'Project Brain Wave'. The Department of State is developing and has reported to the Board a project designed to stimulate display of indigenous anti-Communist sentiment in the countries of Western Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThis memorandum is number 57 in a group of memos declassified by the DOS and can be found on page 109 of a document made accessible at: https://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/96783.pdf.\r\n\r\nAfter this memorandum was sent, someone associated with the Office of International Information and Educational Exchange Programs, Bureau of Public Affairs sent or received an undated draft memorandum, written at some point between January 1, 1951 and December 31, 1952, titled \"Implementation of Operation Brain Wave\".  This document, attached, states as follows: \"I recommend that steps be taken to form a private foundation or organization with an appropriate title, which would in effect be usable as a direct arm of the State Department, which could be used to channel ideas to, and which would on its own initiative promote projects consistent with our objectives in a given country; an organization so eminently respectable that, in the conduct of projects, even though supported financially by the Department of State, the hand of the Department need not appear at all. Such organization could recruit and send people to Europe for example to get Operation Brain Wave underway.\"\r\n\r\nThis draft memorandum can be found at the National Archives and Record Administration, Archives II, College Park, Maryland, and its catalog information can be found at: https://catalog.archives.gov/id/3857396.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Information about Project/Operation Brain Wave has been declassified previously, as shown in the two examples provided above, and additional information about this program might help clarify the role of the DOS in managing tensions during the Cold War. The attached draft memo which references the creation of a \"private foundation or organization\" later identifies this entity as a \"front organization.\" During the Cold War, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) established such an organization, the Congress for Cultural Freedom, and it carried out many of the same functions described in the draft memo. Clarifying any overlap between DOS and CIA activities can help historians, journalists, and lay scholars in better contextualizing the Cold War for the public.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to Pieter van der Hurk, aka Peter Hurkos (May 21, 1911 \u2013 June 1, 1988). Mr. Hurkos was a Dutch immigrant and psychic who maintained a public profile between the years of 1956 and 1988. During this period, he claimed to have extrasensory perception and that he used this ability to assist law enforcement on cases ranging from the arrest of Albert DeSalvo, aka the Boston Strangler, to Charles Manson. Mr. Hurkos was himself arrested by the FBI on February 9, 1964, for impersonation of an FBI agent; he was found guilty and fined $1,000.\r\n\r\nProof of death is not required as Mr. Hurkos's date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request.

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to CONBRIBE (58-5205). \r\n\r\nAt least two prior requests have been made for these records: on July 11, 2011, the FBI opened FOIPA request number 1169380-000, for \"CONBRIBE (1963 & PRIOR)\",  and on August 22, 2020, it opened FOIPA request number 1292493-000, for \"CONBRIBE - Nationalities Intelligence\". The CONBRIBE records deal with Congressional bribery investigations handled by the FBI. CONBRIBE was assigned a Bureau file number of 58-5205.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media.

In addition to the prior FOIPA requests, which demonstrate a continuing public interest in the subject, the CONBRIBE records involve investigations into public corruption targeting members of Congress by foreign agents. These investigations, and their outcomes, would contribute greatly to public understanding of how, historically, the FBI has handled investigations into public officials, especially with regard to the involvement of foreign nations and their agents, along with providing insight into attempts by foreign nationals to influence American officials. There should be no concerns for public privacy or ongoing investigations, as most, if not all of the subjects are now deceased; CONBRIBE investigations occurred during the 1950s and 1960s.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100.
