The letter is referenced in this press release: https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-sends-letters-60-universities-under-investigation-antisemitic-discrimination-and-harassment. Under the Wisconsin Public Records Laws, records custodians must carefully weigh the competing public interests involved when deciding to release any record in their possession.\u00a0 Custodians begin with a presumption of complete public access to such records.\u00a0 However, custodians must consider whether inspection of the record could result in harm to the public interest that would outweigh the benefits of such inspection.\u00a0 When such harm substantially outweighs the benefits of public inspection, such records or portions thereof, must remain confidential. I have interpreted your request to be for a letter received by UW Madison on March 10 th from the U.S. Department of Education. Your request for the U.S. Department of Education letter is denied at this time as the letter warns of potential enforcement action and that action is ongoing. You may request these records at a later date. Please reach out if you have any questions. Ongoing investigation materials: Ongoing investigations are by definition a work in progress. Since the potential enforcement action is ongoing in this instance, when balancing the public\u2019s interest in the release of these records with the interests of the university and the U.S. Department of Education, I am making the determination that the public interest in withholding these records is greater than the public interest in release. The public has an interest in the effective enforcement action by the Office for Civil Rights under Title VI. The premature release of records related to such a potential enforcement could impede the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s thorough investigation, and therefore, impact the rights of both the agency and the university. It is in the public\u2019s interest to allow the university to respond to this letter and to allow the U.S. Department of Education to conduct its investigation without interruption or prejudice following the established federal process for Title VI complaints. As stated above, you may request this record at a later date, but this request is denied at this time and closed. The university is required to inform you that to the extent this amounts to a denial of your request it is subject to review by mandamus under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1)(a) or by application to the attorney general or district attorney pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1)(b). The university has responded to your request and it is now closed. Sincerely, Julie Laundrie Public Records Custodian Office of Compliance University of Wisconsin-Madison   \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Access the Public Records Center to View the Request",
