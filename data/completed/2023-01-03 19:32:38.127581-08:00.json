        "communication": "Good Afternoon,\r\n\r\nPlease see Kent School District's clarifying questions to your request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following financial records for all schools under the authority of the school district:\r\n- Acquaintance Roll (or salary and employment information by any other name)\r\n\r\nKSD Comment:  \"Acquaintance Roll\" is not a term we are familiar with.  We can help present salary information, as we have access to that.  Clarification would be good:\r\n\r\n  *   Would they require amounts in aggregate for the year, or individual monthly pay?\r\n     *   What is the objective?  If simply overall pay, we might suggest information in the aggregate.\r\n     *   Does the information need to be broken down by person?\r\n     *   Payroll information can be quite nebulous, with many different categories of pay, deductions, and expenses.  Are they needing that much detail?\r\n  *   What time periods are they requesting?\r\n\r\n- The Cash Book (or record of all financial transactions by any other name, specifically including COVID relief funds accounting)\r\n\r\nKSD Comment:  \"Cash Book\" is not a term we are familiar with.  We could provide information on all cash we have received, if this is what is being requested, but this can be very detailed.  Also, is money going out a part of this request?  Clarification would be good:\r\n\r\n  *   For money in -- Do they require the information by each party paying us or would they like to see the information by types of cash received (revenue types in the aggregate)?\r\n  *   Revenue in the aggregate would take much less time than information by individuals.\r\n  *   For money out - are they looking for more than just an aggregation?  If detailed transactions were needed, this data would be voluminous.  One can imagine if $450 million is spent each year, how voluminous this might be; i.e., millions of transactions, possibly.\r\n  *   What time periods are they requesting?\r\n  *   COVID relief fund accounting is not too much of a burden, but do they want that down to the transaction level, or in the aggregate?\r\n\r\n- Contingencies Register\r\n\r\nAre you looking for what obligations we may have in the future to pay, we could interpret this as what we call \"encumbrances\" or are you looking for what we call \"accounts payable\".  Accounts payable information is what is owed to vendors and can be provided by vendor name, or in the aggregate, by the type of payment.  Further clarification is definitely needed here.\r\n\r\n  *   What time period is being requested?\r\n\r\n- Fee Collection Register\r\n\r\nWe would surmise this would be a published list of what fees we are charging our students for education, is this interpretation correct? Additionally, what time period is being requested?\r\n\r\n- Register of Donations Received\r\n\r\nDo you want this by person and individual instance, or in the aggregate?  In addition, this could be considered part of the \"Cash Book\" request.\r\n\r\n  *   What time period is being requested?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Register of Scholarships\r\n\r\nAre you interested in what activity there has been for scholarships we manage; i.e., money received and disbursed?\r\n\r\n  *   What time period is being requested?\r\n\r\n- Budget records for the last 5 years\r\n\r\nThis is very nebulous and further clarification is needed,  Literally, every record generated from a finance standpoint has to do with budget. Please clarify why type of  budget records you are seeking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D8C778.DE4AB2F0]<https://us-east-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=kent.k12.wa.us&u=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZW50LmsxMi53YS51cy8=&e=bGJyYXppbGVAa3Vvdy5vcmc=&h=d6ef8f34c41045f7a123e0f865a2f995&t=bnZCSVU5eEZ0Uy9VSlJ3eG5kU3VUdFBSN3NqWFl3MXBHQ2ZYWVBRMUhVRT0=>\r\nTyler Inboden (She/Her)\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nSuperintendent's Office | Kent School District<https://us-east-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=kent.k12.wa.us&u=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZW50LmsxMi53YS51cy8=&e=bGJyYXppbGVAa3Vvdy5vcmc=&h=d6ef8f34c41045f7a123e0f865a2f995&t=bnZCSVU5eEZ0Uy9VSlJ3eG5kU3VUdFBSN3NqWFl3MXBHQ2ZYWVBRMUhVRT0=>\r\n12033 SE 256th Street, A-100, Kent, WA 98030-6503\r\nO: (253) 373-7218 | Tyler.Inboden@kent.k12.wa.us<mailto:Tyler.Inboden@kent.k12.wa.us>\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

Therefore, we are denying this item of your request.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Department estimates that it will provide you with the responsive, redacted record by or before January 2, 2023.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Requester:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have completed our review of your request to the Los Angeles Police Department (\u201cLAPD\u201d or \u201cDepartment\u201d) under the California Public Records Act (Cal. Govt. Code section 6250, et seq., hereinafter the \u201cCPRA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) seeking the following:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"Information on all hate crimes occuring in the city of jurisdiction from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2020. The information should include (although not be restricted to) the following: date-of-occurrence (YYYY-MM-DD), time-of-occurrence (HH:MM), description of crime committed, location information at the finest geographic level available (street address or block), beat, district, weapon used, bias motivation (e.g., Anti-Black/Anti-Gay/Anti-Transgender), number of suspect(s), number of victim(s), injuries incurred, suspect(s) race, victim(s) race, victim(s) sex, suspect(s) sex, victim(s) age, suspect(s) age.\"\u00a0[sic]\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 6254(b); 6254(c); 6254(f); 6254(k); and 6255.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA responsive document has been provided to you, pertaining to hate crime data from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2020, including column fields for date and time of occurrence, report number (\"DR_NBR\"), area, reporting district, description of crime committed, bias motivation, weapon used, party (suspect, victim, arrestee, or involved party), party sequence (the ordinal number of suspect(s) and victim(s) for each incident), and the suspects' and victims' sex, descent (which includes race), and ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the requested location information, you may cross-reference the provided report numbers (\"DR_NBR\") in Column D of the responsive document with the crime data publicly available on the City's Open Data portal. By doing so, this eliminates the need to review each individual incident location for confidentiality and privacy exemptions; therefore, no redactions were necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen Data may be accessed at the following links:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCity of LA Crime Data from 2010 to 2019:\r\n\r\nhttps://click.pstmrk.it/2tsm/data.lacity.org%2FPublic-Safety%2FCrime-Data-from-2010-to-2019%2F63jg-8b9z/BslxBDYN/DbEk/nT4J0d7bs9/cmVxdWVzdGVyX3JlcXVlc3RfY2xvc2Vk\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCity of LA Crime Data from 2020 to Present:\r\n\r\nhttps://click.pstmrk.it/2tsm/data.lacity.org%2FPublic-Safety%2FCrime-Data-from-2020-to-Present%2F2nrs-mtv8/B8lxBDYN/DbEk/HaDrkNE_bk/cmVxdWVzdGVyX3JlcXVlc3RfY2xvc2Vk\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe location information in Open Data has already been reviewed for public release.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWithin each link above, data can be viewed by clicking \"View Data.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWithin each Dataset, the\u00a0Filter\u00a0function can be used to filter for\u00a0the reporting number (DR_NO) and MO Codes (Mocodes).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor example, the following filter may be used to ascertain location information from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2019:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdd a New Filter Condition, from the drop-down select:\r\n\r\nDR_NO\u00a0-&gt; contains\r\n\r\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[DR_NBR]\u00a0from the responsive document provided (Column D).\r\n\r\nConfirm the small box to the left of the search term box is checked.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the alternative, you may also filter by MO Code (0903 &amp; 0921):\r\n\r\nAdd a New Filter Condition, from the drop-down select:\r\n\r\nMocodes\u00a0-&gt; contains\r\n\r\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[0903]\u00a0or\r\n\r\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[0921]\r\n\r\nConfirm the small box to the left of the search term box is checked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may download the datasets via the \"Export\" function for easier cross-referencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA manual for deciphering codes used in the dataset has been provided to you, titled \"CCADMANUAL2019_121819.pdf.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

For instance, if Shotspotter was implemented in the city on January 1, 2008, I would like all Shotspotter data from this date to December 31st, 2020. The list/database should include, where possible, the date, time, location (address or latitude+longitude coordinates), single or multiple shot distinction, whether the shots were confirmed, police district located, and associated case number for each alert. Please note that previous requests for this infomration have been made and have not redacted the latitude/longitude component. Please do not redact this information.\r\n2) Any document that provides information on the procedure for how the police department should respond to Shotspotter alerts. In particular, I am looking for a document that describes how the police will react to a Shotspotter alert. For instance, if an alert is created, are police dispatched?\r\n3) Shotspotter rollout dates. If the police department rolled out the Shotspotter data by police district, please include the implementation dates attached to each police district.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with these public records in a machine-readable ASCII format, such as a CSV, SQL, TXT, or similar raw file. CSV or SQL files are preferred when available. Please email the responsive records to my email address: michaeltopper@ucsb.edu.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Topper",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

        "communication": "\"Good Afternoon:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Richland School District has received several public records request from your organization (muckrock) in the last couple of weeks.  Further, the District has been working to answer your original request since November 2021.  On November 4, 2021 the Richland School District received your first records request. Your request was sent from the e-mail address 120953-42737343@requests.muckrock.com.  Your request sought the following records:\r\n\r\n\u2026all Public Records Requests received by Richland School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 8th and 9th, the District sent you two requests for clarification.  Then on November 15, the District e-mailed you.  The body of the District\u2019s e-mail is as follows:\r\n\r\nThis District has assigned your request with the number 1142021MR for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when corresponding about this request.\r\n\r\nSince receiving your request, I have sent at least two requests for clarification to your group and have not heard back.  I corresponded using the portal specific to the Richland School District and assigned by your group. I have not heard back from you.\r\n\r\nI am seeking clarification of your very large records request so that the District can provide you with an adequate response.  Is there a staff member that I can speak to for this clarification?  Understanding that you are on the other side of the country, is there a good day and time for me to call?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso on November 15th, you provided an initial clarification.  That same day the District acknowledged your clarification.  The District\u2019s response is as follows:\r\n\r\nI understand your request to be for a complete electronic copy of all public records requests received by the Richland School District #400 including the District\u2019s responses for the years 2021-2021.\r\n\r\nWhat I need clarification on is are you requesting all correspondence not just the initial request and the District\u2019s response as there are time like this, that the District asks for clarification.  Further, there are requests that are abandoned.  By that I mean, the Requestor does not clarify or does not come to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, are you including requests for video in your request?  If so, the District will need to give third parties adequate notice of your request and the opportunity to seek an injunction.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to speak over the phone with the member from your team who is making this request so that we can use our time more efficiently in responding to your request.  Please feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou responded on November 16th by stating that your request was for copies of any public records requests received by the District and any responses to these requests by the District, including abandoned requests and requests for video. You also acknowledged the District\u2019s need to give third-party notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 22, the District informed you that it was in the process of compiling a list of individuals who the District would need to provide third-party notice to and their contact information.  The District notified you that it was beginning the process of reviewing the responsive records to determine if there were any other necessary redactions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on the complexity of your request, the need to provide third party notice, and the need to carefully review the records for redactions, the District informed you it estimated it would take fourteen months to fully respond to your request. The District informed you that it would be providing the responsive records to you in installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District also noted that it was in the process of updating its public records policy.  Part of that policy update related to fees associated with processing and answering records request. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStarting on November 23rd, the District began received a large number of phone calls and e-mails from the individuals who had received the third-party notices.  Most individuals were concerned with who had requested the information and how the records would be used.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a letter to you on December 1st the District asked that you complete a commercial purposes declaration.  This declaration clearly states that you are not seeking lists of employees and their disclosable information for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn December 6th, the District received notice from you that you were neither seeking records for commercial purposes nor were you requesting any production of responsive documents that required a commercial purposes declaration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District continued to receive considerable communications from third parties it had provided notice to regarding your request. Also, the District was reviewing the responsive records to make sure they included all necessary redactions and contained a redaction log.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District e-mailed you installments to your records request by e-mail on the following dates:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 2022\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, the District notified you that it was migrating to the GovQA platform to received, process and release all public records requests.  One of the many reasons for this migration is that the District can release responsive files that are significantly larger than what the District\u2019s e-mail system can accommodate.  This allows for records to be release quicker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, you notified the District that while the District was free to use the GovQA platform, you as a Requestor were under no obligation to use the platform. Further you started, \u201c\u2026 as such I respectfully refuse.\u201d  Further you wrote e-mailed the District:\r\n\r\nThe District is directed to provide the requested public records via email or direct no-password, no registration, internet file sharing link. If this is not possible, then responsive records my be provided via US MAIL.\r\n\r\nUS MAIL ADDRESS:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District e-mailed you the following response:\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has begun using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The downside to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou acknowledged the District\u2019s e-mail. You again said you would accept response records via US mail and again provided your mailing address in Sumerville, MA.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District provided you with the following correspondence:\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nRichland School District received a public information request from you on November 04, 2021 and it is being processed in accordance with Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThe District assigned your request with the reference number R000001-020722 for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when communicating about your request.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following records:\r\n\r\n\u201call public records requests received by the District from November 14, 2011 through November 14, 2021. This includes the initial request, all responsive records from the District, and any redaction logs. Further your request also includes abandoned requests and requests for video records. Excluding list of names seeming for commercial purposes\u201d\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has began using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The down side to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please reply to this email. Thank you for your attention.\r\n\r\nApril 1st, 2022 \u2013 the District mailed you a thumb drive that contained 240 files of responsive records.  It also contained a bill for $36.95. This was sent to your mailing address.  The address the District used was:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn May 4th the District communicated to you the following:\r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of November 04, 2021, Reference # R000001-020722.\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nWe have not received your payment on invoice number INV22-R000001-1 for Public Records requested by you on November 04, 2021 with Request Number R000001-020722.  \r\n\r\nPlease see attached or login to the Public Records Request Center to view details.\r\n\r\nYou can make a check or money order payable to: Richland School District and mail to:\r\n\r\nAttn: Nayomi Munguia\r\n6972 Keene Road\r\nWest Richland WA 99353\r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nGalt Pettett\r\nCertified Public Records Officer\r\nLegal\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2022, the District sent to you a thumb drive to replace the two that you reported that you had not received.  There was no charge or fee for this as the last two that we have sent to you, have not been received by your organization.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nToday, the District placed into the United States Postal Service a priority mail envelope containing a thumb drive with another installment of responsive records. We were told by the Post Office that the envelope would be delivered to your Boston address on Monday, December 5th.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOver the past few weeks, the District has received several new requests from you.  On November 14, 2022, the District received the following public records request from you:\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2021. Note: this identifiable record should be an exact copy of the answers submitted to the JLARC Public Records Request Reporting System.\r\n\r\n2. Provide complete copies of any and all worksheets, drafts, estimates, notes, and emails related to the completion of your agency\u2019s final 2021 JLARC report and answers to the JLARC website questionnaire submitted for the year 2021.\r\n\r\n3.

        "communication": "\"RE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of December 02, 2022, Reference # R000178-120222\r\n\r\nGood Afternoon:\r\n\r\nThe Richland School District has received several public records request from your organization (muckrock) in the last couple of weeks.  Further, the District has been working to answer your original request since November 2021.  On November 4, 2021 the Richland School District received your first records request. Your request was sent from the e-mail address 120953-42737343@requests.muckrock.com.  Your request sought the following records:\r\n\r\n\u2026all Public Records Requests received by Richland School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nOn November 8th and 9th, the District sent you two requests for clarification.  Then on November 15, the District e-mailed you.  The body of the District\u2019s e-mail is as follows:\r\n\r\nThis District has assigned your request with the number 1142021MR for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when corresponding about this request.\r\n\r\nSince receiving your request, I have sent at least two requests for clarification to your group and have not heard back.  I corresponded using the portal specific to the Richland School District and assigned by your group. I have not heard back from you.\r\n\r\nI am seeking clarification of your very large records request so that the District can provide you with an adequate response.  Is there a staff member that I can speak to for this clarification?  Understanding that you are on the other side of the country, is there a good day and time for me to call?\r\n\r\nAlso on November 15th, you provided an initial clarification.  That same day the District acknowledged your clarification.  The District\u2019s response is as follows:\r\n\r\nI understand your request to be for a complete electronic copy of all public records requests received by the Richland School District #400 including the District\u2019s responses for the years 2021-2021.\r\n\r\nWhat I need clarification on is are you requesting all correspondence not just the initial request and the District\u2019s response as there are time like this, that the District asks for clarification.  Further, there are requests that are abandoned.  By that I mean, the Requestor does not clarify or does not come to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, are you including requests for video in your request?  If so, the District will need to give third parties adequate notice of your request and the opportunity to seek an injunction.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to speak over the phone with the member from your team who is making this request so that we can use our time more efficiently in responding to your request.  Please feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\nYou responded on November 16th by stating that your request was for copies of any public records requests received by the District and any responses to these requests by the District, including abandoned requests and requests for video. You also acknowledged the District\u2019s need to give third-party notice.\r\n\r\nOn November 22, the District informed you that it was in the process of compiling a list of individuals who the District would need to provide third-party notice to and their contact information.  The District notified you that it was beginning the process of reviewing the responsive records to determine if there were any other necessary redactions. \r\n\r\nBased on the complexity of your request, the need to provide third party notice, and the need to carefully review the records for redactions, the District informed you it estimated it would take fourteen months to fully respond to your request. The District informed you that it would be providing the responsive records to you in installments.\r\n\r\nThe District also noted that it was in the process of updating its public records policy.  Part of that policy update related to fees associated with processing and answering records request. \r\n\r\nStarting on November 23rd, the District began received a large number of phone calls and e-mails from the individuals who had received the third-party notices.  Most individuals were concerned with who had requested the information and how the records would be used.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to you on December 1st the District asked that you complete a commercial purposes declaration.  This declaration clearly states that you are not seeking lists of employees and their disclosable information for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nOn December 6th, the District received notice from you that you were neither seeking records for commercial purposes nor were you requesting any production of responsive documents that required a commercial purposes declaration. \r\n\r\nThe District continued to receive considerable communications from third parties it had provided notice to regarding your request. Also, the District was reviewing the responsive records to make sure they included all necessary redactions and contained a redaction log.\r\n\r\nThe District e-mailed you installments to your records request by e-mail on the following dates:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 2022\r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, the District notified you that it was migrating to the GovQA platform to received, process and release all public records requests.  One of the many reasons for this migration is that the District can release responsive files that are significantly larger than what the District\u2019s e-mail system can accommodate.  This allows for records to be release quicker.\r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, you notified the District that while the District was free to use the GovQA platform, you as a Requestor were under no obligation to use the platform. Further you started, \u201c\u2026 as such I respectfully refuse.\u201d  Further you wrote e-mailed the District:\r\n\r\nThe District is directed to provide the requested public records via email or direct no-password, no registration, internet file sharing link. If this is not possible, then responsive records my be provided via US MAIL.\r\n\r\nUS MAIL ADDRESS:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District e-mailed you the following response:\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has begun using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The downside to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\nYou acknowledged the District\u2019s e-mail. You again said you would accept response records via US mail and again provided your mailing address in Sumerville, MA.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District provided you with the following correspondence:\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nRichland School District received a public information request from you on November 04, 2021 and it is being processed in accordance with Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThe District assigned your request with the reference number R000001-020722 for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when communicating about your request.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following records:\r\n\r\n\u201call public records requests received by the District from November 14, 2011 through November 14, 2021. This includes the initial request, all responsive records from the District, and any redaction logs. Further your request also includes abandoned requests and requests for video records. Excluding list of names seeming for commercial purposes\u201d\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.

The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please reply to this email. Thank you for your attention.\r\n\r\nApril 1st, 2022 \u2013 the District mailed you a thumb drive that contained 240 files of responsive records.  It also contained a bill for $36.95. This was sent to your mailing address.  The address the District used was:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn May 4th the District communicated to you the following:\r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of November 04, 2021, Reference # R000001-020722.\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nWe have not received your payment on invoice number INV22-R000001-1 for Public Records requested by you on November 04, 2021 with Request Number R000001-020722.  \r\n\r\nPlease see attached or login to the Public Records Request Center to view details.\r\n\r\nYou can make a check or money order payable to: Richland School District and mail to:\r\n\r\nAttn: Nayomi Munguia\r\n6972 Keene Road\r\nWest Richland WA 99353\r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nGalt Pettett\r\nCertified Public Records Officer\r\nLegal\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2022, the District sent to you a thumb drive to replace the two that you reported that you had not received.

I take great pride in providing excellent services to Requestors. I am in no way trying to frustrate you or not comply with the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, the Richland School District received a records request from an e-mail address containing \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  In that request, the Requestor sought several years of records requests and the District\u2019s response to those records request.  The District has been answering this original request by sending installments to the Boston address below.\r\n\r\nThen in November, your request and others were received by the District from an e-mail address with \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  Since these requests were all from \u201cmuckrock\u201d, the District presumed they were all from the same organization.\r\n\r\nAre there different employees of Muckrock making different requests?  Again, I truly want to provide you with the records you want and do not want to frustrate you, but maybe I don\u2019t understand the Muckrock organization.\r\n\r\nAny insight you can provide would be appreciated.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nGalt L.

You requested the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2020 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2020.\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2020 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nRichland School District has identified and located records responsive to your request.  Another installment to your public records request is now available. Pursuant to your request not to use the District's GovQA portal, they are being attached to this e-mail.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the District's administration building and all of its schools are closed in observance of the winter break. Regardless, the District is providing you with another installment. I estimate your next installment will be sent out in the next ten working days.\r\n\r\nSome of the records requests from 2020 were for video footage. Due to the size of the video files and your request to have all of the responsive records sent to you by e-mail and not use the District's GovQA portal, the District may need break these files into smaller files.\r\n\r\nBeginning December 1, 2022 the District will be charging for all public records requests.  Please see our policy and procedures for our fee schedule https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820578  and  https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820577\r\n\r\nIf I have misunderstood your request in any way or you have any questions, please reply to this email.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nGalt L. Pettett\r\nCertified Public Records Officer and Records Custodian\r\nRichland School District #400\r\n6972 Keene Road\r\nWest Richland, WA  99353\r\ngalt.pettett@rsd.edu<mailto:galt.pettett@rsd.edu>\r\n(509)967-6009\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------- NOTICE OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE: This Richland School District e-mail account is public domain.

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Current policies, rules and practices related to access to make outgoing and receive incoming telephone calls that apply to youth at DYS Middleton - Northeast Regional Youth Service Center and for other facilities and programs in the DYS Northeast region, including sub-contractors, including Strive and Bright Futures.  This includes youth access to facility phones and to personal cell phones. It also includes who they can call and how that is determined, and frequency and duration of calls allowed.\r\n\r\n2. Current policies, rules and practices related to in-person visits, both frequency and duration, that apply to youth at DYS Middleton - Northeast Regional Youth Service Center and other facilities and programs in the DYS Northeast region, including sub-contractors, including Strive and Bright Futures. This includes who can visit and how that is determined. This also includes any access to video visits.\r\n\r\n3. Any additional information relevant to assessing whether DYS Northeast Region phone and visiting policies are in fact significantly more limiting and restrictive than all Massachusetts jails and prisons and the impact this has on teenagers trying to maintain and build strong relationships with family and loved ones.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBetsey Chace",

Such assessments, findings, investigation, or studies may have been completed between the time period of January 1, 2011, and November 1, 2021, and involve petroleum or fuel leaks. \r\n\r\nUpon information and belief, assessments, findings, investigations, or studies may have been in response to citations by the Hawaii Department of Health for violations related to operation and maintenance of the facility. They could involve plans to prevent fines and violations stemming from routine inspections and may also be a response to Notices of Violation and Order, or NOVOs, involving the Red Hill Fuel Storage Facility (RHBFSF). \r\n\r\nOn December 5, 2021, CNN reported, \"Records show a history of fuel leaks plaguing Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in the past decade, with the most recent leak occurring 11 days before the Navy announced it had discovered contamination in the Red Hill well on Oahu.\" (The media organization was referring to a leak in late November when they mentioned the \"most recent leak.\") \r\n\r\n\"The deputy commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Rear Adm. Blake Converse, confirmed a petroleum leak is the cause of the latest breach,\" according to the CNN report. \r\n\r\nIn October 2021, the Hawaii Department of Health released a copy of a NOVO from the Solid and Hazardous Waste Branch. It listed violations that stemmed from failures and mismanagement at the underground storage tank system located at Red Hill/Pearl Harbor-Hickam on Oahu. This is also referred to as the fuel storage facility. \r\n\r\nThe Hawaii Department of Health previously responded to fuel contamination in January 2014. According to CNN, \"During the refueling of a tank, the Navy identified an estimated fuel release of up to 27,000 gallons of JP-8 jet fuel.\" \r\n\r\n\"U.S. Navy subsequently drained the tank and collected samples from existing monitoring wells. Results taken in and around Tank 5 indicated increases of hydrocarbons in soil vapor and groundwater,\" the Hawaii Health Department stated. \r\n\r\nAs a professional reporter who has a track record of coverage of the United States Defense Department and its military branches, I assert that I should be designated as a media requester for the purpose of assessing fees. \r\n\r\nGiven the amount of public interest from news media including ABC News, the Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Honolulu Civil Beat, Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Stars and Stripes, etc, I additionally ask that any and all fees be waived. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of any and all charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to July 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nFor each month, I\u2019m seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, date of birth or age, title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status, and gross annual salary. If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Goehring",

Under the RTKL, a written response to your request was due on or before November 22, 2022.  On November 22, 2022, I wrote to you indicating OA required an additional thirty (30) days to provide a response.  This is OA\u2019s final response. \r\n\r\nYou requested:\r\n\r\nMonthly electronic listings of all employees of the Pennsylvania Executive Branch from January 1, 2019 to July 31, 2022. Specifically,\u2026electronic listings of all individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 1, 2019 to July 31, 2022\u2026with the following fields for each employee: full legal name, unique employee identification code, date of birth or age, title, department or agency, race, gender, full-time/part-time status, location, hire date, termination date, civil service status, and gross annual salary.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour request is attached.  Your request is granted in part and denied in part. You can access the responsive records through the following link:   CWOPA Emps by Quarter 2019-2022.xlsx The spreadsheet has tabs in quarterly intervals containing the public data points you requested for employees under the Governor\u2019s jurisdiction, with the exception of those employees whose information is exempt in whole or in part for security reasons and as set forth in more detail below.  This link will only be available for a period of thirty days after December 21, 2022, after which you will no longer have access to the link.  In addition, please note, all employee work locations are reflected through the headquarter addresses for the agency.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour request is denied in part due to several requested items being exempt from disclosure under the RTKL.  The portion of your request seeking employees\u2019 date of birth, age, gender, race and middle names are denied pursuant to the Pennsylvania constitutional right to privacy.  See Rusty Brown and the Freedom Foundation v. Pennsylvania Office of Administration, OOR Dkt. No.: AP 2021-1707 (finding that birth years and middle names were exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Pennsylvania constitutional right to privacy).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, several employees\u2019 information is exempt, either in whole or in part, from disclosure due to the following exemptions:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSection 708(b)(1)(ii), which exempts disclosure if disclosing the information \u201cwould be reasonably likely to result in a substantial and demonstrable risk of physical harm to or the personal security of an individual.\u201d  65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(1)(ii);\r\n \r\n\r\nSection 708(b)(2), which exempts disclosure if disclosure of the information jeopardizes or threatens public safety or preparedness or public protection activity and the information is maintained in connection with the military, homeland security, national defense, law enforcement or other public safety activity.   65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(2);\r\n \r\n\r\nSection 708(b)(3), which exempts disclosure if disclosure of the information \u201ccreates a reasonable likelihood of endangering the safety or the physical security of a building, public utility resources, infrastructure, facility or information storage system\u2026.\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(3); and\r\n \r\n\r\nSection 708(b)(6)(iii), which exempts from disclosure \u201cthe name or other identifying information relating to an individual performing an undercover or covert law enforcement activity.\u201d  65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(6)(iii).  \r\n \r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the denial of access to records. Any appeal to this response must be made in writing to the Office of Open Records (OOR), 333 Market Street, 16th Floor, Harrisburg, PA 17101-2234.

A\r\nconfidential complaint becomes public record after a probable cause\r\ndetermination.  See s. 106.25(7), F.S.\r\n\r\nBefore I can release the records, I am required to review the documents and\r\napply required redactions to any confidential and exempt information that\r\nmay be included in the complaints.  I will notify you the number of pages\r\nand any costs involved, if any, prior to completion of the request.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDonna Ann Malphurs\r\nAgency Clerk/Public Information Officer",

A copy of the Request is attached to this Letter as \"Appendix A\".\r\n\r\nOn 10/20/2022, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Acknowledged receiving my FOIA Request on 10/18/2022 and reported the following Tracking Numbers for it: 23-00135-F, 23-00499-F, 23-00566-F, 23-00567-F, 23-00568-F, 23-00569-F, 23-00570-F.  Veterans Health Administration stated in that Acknowledgement that the Requested Records, if they exist, will be maintained by Veterans Health Administration; as well as other divisions of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, including the VA Office of the Inspector General, all of which VHA is coordinating with to satisfy the Request.  A copy of VHA's 10/20/2022 Acknowledgement is attached to this Letter within \"Appendix A\".\r\n\r\nOn 11/17/2022, I received an \"Agency Final Response\" to my FOIA Request from Government Information Specialist Barya Offer, on behalf of the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  The sum of Offer's purported \"Agency Final Response\" is, \"please see the Agency Final Response regarding your request\"; with an attached PDF file named \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial.pdf\".  Said file is a letter from Supervisory Government Information Specialist Ruthhee G. Bellamy of the VA OIG Release Information Office - notifying me that VA OIG assigned Tracking Number 23-00006-FOIA to my Request, among other things.  A copy of VHA's 11/17/2022 \"Agency Final Response\" is included in the \"Appendix A\" attachment to this Letter.\r\n\r\nThe \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial\" letter from VA OIG on 11/17/2022 is attached to this Letter as \"Appendix B\"; and declares \"we were unable to locate any responsive records pertaining to your request\"; yet only as the Request pertains to Inspector General Michael J. Missal in VA OIG Records.  Unfortunately, VA OIG's Response to my Request is a false statement of fact; provable by one of many Records in my possession which would have to be included in any satisfactory Response to my Request, notwithstanding whether that Response is from VA OIG, VHA or otherwise applicable officse / divisions of US DVA.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned Record in my possession is an e-mail I sent to Inspector General Missal and others on 05/27/2022 regarding VCOEB, that a simple search for the text \"VCOEB\" will produce upon querying Inspector General Missal's e-mail correspondence between 05/01/2022 and Present.  Given that e-mail was not returned to sender and Inspector General Missal directly corresponded with me several times in the recent past from the same e-mail address; and because information about a Federal Advisory Committee that holds Public Meetings in Open Session on Public land for Public attendance (as Publicly Noticed in the Federal Register), is not qualified to be suppressed due limited National Security provisions under 5 U.S.C. Statutes governing FOIA - apparently the minimum effort to satisfactorily Respond to my Request is beyond some U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Officials' intent to perform...  Despite VA OIG's purported \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial\" Letter probably cost Federal Taxpayer's far more to produce than performing the simple searches to lawfully satisfy and Respond to my Request will; presuming Public Records required to satisfy my Request were not unlawfully tampered with. Even in that hypothetical scenario though, the Records are obtainable from one of many archives US DVA is Mandated to retain as National Security against the tampering or loss of such Records.  A copy of my aforementioned 05/27/2022 e-mail to Inspector General Missal and one of many e-mails Inspector General Missal sent me from the same address he received my 05/27/2020 e-mail at, are attached to this Letter as \"Appendix C\".\r\nNotwithstanding the validity or lack thereof in VA OIG's Response to a portion of my Request through VHA, the partial Response is not a legitimate, full Response to my Request; despite it being uncannily misrepresented as such by false statements of fact.\r\n\r\nThe Agency is at least procedurally failing to Respond to my Request on time in accordance with Federal Public Law.  I reassure you the Requested Records regarding a Federal Advisory Committee with a Public Law Mandate and Charter to improve outcomes for Veterans via Public Meetings held in Open Session here in Our Nation's Capital of Veteran Homelessness - are delays of Public Records offering a direct positive impact on disabled homeless Veterans' probability of survival and General Welfare of U.S. Taxpayers  Contrarily, the ongoing and baseless delays Responding to my Request are negatively impacting disabled homeless Veterans and Federal Taxpayers, until and unless the Request is fully and legitimately Responded to.\r\n\r\nGiven my maintained Good Faith in the majority of Our U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Staff's Public Integrity and capacity to ethically perform their duties in accordance with the Department's true Mission - I expect nothing less than the People of the United States of America do in this matter; a swift, comprehensive, accurate and satisfactory Response to my Request in accordance with Our Rights, Public Laws and increasing expenditures to expect no less of Our U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' performance in respect thereof.\r\n\r\nI declare under under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

        "communication": "That Sherre Johnston is in jail with a case pending is a great excuse when the real problem is HOW many times Sherre's been \"handled\", and let go because she is the Sheriff's girlfriend AND because of the events of september 2, 2015 when Mike McNamara, the Sheriff's brother died in her arms. THIS has gotten her off of DWI's, burglary of the Sheriff's shed, harassing a tv reporter and other people, and most recently burglary of another habitation. The City of Robinson's legal representative, Lawyer Dixon, is used to protecting his other client, Sheriff McNamara from all things Sherre Johnston so it is no wonder that this request has gone on this long.  It is also why the Sheriff's department is the only Department in the State of Texas that does not have body cameras. NO body cams keep the Sheriff's people from recording Sherre screaming for Parnell. Unfortunately, Robinson, like everyone else, HAS body cams. These will prove as has been proven over and over again, that the woman has a get out of jail free cards because she's the Sheriff's girlfriend. Ask them.",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "Dear Records Custodian,\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (MCL 15.231 et. seq.) for documents that detail how your community\u2019s water system functions, including details on utility terminations, restorations, and rates.\r\n\r\nAs context for this request, I am requesting these records on behalf of the People\u2019s Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization that advocates for equitable access, protection, and affordability of utility services, and water conservation. We are filing similar requests for information with many other Michigan water utilities in collaboration with residents, community leaders, and local officials to better support the needs of low-income customers. If any of this information is publicly available and accessible, please send a link to the webpage where it is located. Please reply to this request via email. If you have any question or concern about this request, please call Cass Charrette at 248-980-1191.\r\n\r\nWhen possible, please provide the requested quantitative data in an Excel spreadsheet or other native digital format (such as CSV files). \r\n\r\n1. A copy of any data and documents that list the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service terminated starting January 1, 2019 to date of the submission of the FOIA, the reason for the termination, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this data is produced in another format, such as written logs or summary reports, please provide a copy of that instead. If your agency has a policy that home address information is exempt from FOIA, please provide this data at the street level. \r\n\r\n2. Any documents describing and listing the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service restored starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, following a disconnection. If this data is included in the same data set as Item 6, you may provide that full data set in lieu of processing this element separately.\r\n\r\n3. A copy of any existing, regularly generated reports that include the total amount of water and wastewater customer arrearages, number of customers in arrears, and median amount of arrearages per customer, and number of customers subject to potential service disconnection due to arrears by customer class (e.g., residential, non-profit, commercial, industrial) starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA. \r\n\r\n4. A copy of a list of referrals the utility/water system/municipality sent to the tax assessor to place a tax lien on properties due to non-payment of any water or sewer bill, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this information is stored in a summary database, you may provide that database.\r\n\r\n5. Any documents describing or listing the addresses of residential customer accounts that have been enrolled in and have been discharged from the Great Lakes Water Authority\u2019s Water Residential Assistance Program, and the reason for such removal or discharge, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA. \r\n\r\nAs I am requesting these records as a representative of People\u2019s Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization, and am doing so in the public interest, I request a waiver of fees. The analysis and release of these materials will contribute significantly to public understanding of water affordability issues in the tri-county area. \r\n\r\nI will expect a response within 5 business days as provided by law. If my request is denied in whole or in part, I expect a detailed justification for withholding the records. I also request any segregable portions that are not exempt to be disclosed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for reducing the burden of my request, please reach out and we are happy to discuss.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPeople\u2019s Water Board Coalition",

Shift length/times of all Student Resource Officers (SROs) employed by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department dating from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. In particular the data should include (although not restricted to): officer badge number, date of shift, hours of shift (e.g. 9:00-17:00), race of officer, age of officer, experience of officer, and school assigned to.\r\n\r\n2. Of the officers in item (1) above, shift length/times of every shift the officer has worked within the department regardless of assignment. For instance, if an officer was assigned as an SRO in 2017, I am looking for all of their completed shift data from January 1, 2010 - December 31, 2019 including: officer badge number, date of shift, hours of shift (same as above in (1)).\r\n\r\n3. For each officer in item (1), all use-of-force reports and complaints filed by/against each officer.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Topper",

        "communication": "Mr. Topper:\r\n\r\nThank you for your questions pertaining to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) School Resource Officers dating from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019.  As background, the CMPD's School Resource Officers Unit (SRO) was not centralized until the summer of 2016.  As a result, the information provided in this response reflects SROs assigned during fiscal years 2016-2017 and 2018-2019.\r\n\r\nPlease find below and attached responses to your questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.            Shift length/times of all Student Resource Officers (SROs) employed by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department dating from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. In particular the data should include (although not restricted to): officer badge number, date of shift, hours of shift (e.g. 9:00-17:00), race of officer, age of officer, experience of officer, and school assigned to.\r\n\r\nSROs have a standard weekly schedule of 42.5 hours and each school has a different schedule that is subject to change from year to year.\r\n\r\nPersonnel records of City employees are confidential pursuant to North Carolina General Statute (NCGS) 160A-168. Furthermore, pursuant to NCGS 160A-168(b)(11), the City is only allowed to release the \"[d]ate type of each dismissal, suspension, or demotion for disciplinary reasons taken by the municipality. Attached please find copies of the Public Information Reports of CMPD Police Officers assigned as School Resource Officers during the fiscal years 2016-2017 and 2018-2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.            Of the officers in item (1) above, shift length/times of every shift the officer has worked within the department regardless of assignment. For instance, if an officer was assigned as an SRO in 2017, I am looking for all of their completed shift data from January 1, 2010 - December 31, 2019 including: officer badge number, date of shift, hours of shift (same as above in (1)).\r\n\r\nSROs have a standard weekly schedule of 42.5 hours and each school has a different schedule that is subject to change from year to year.\r\n\r\n3.       For each officer in item (1), all use-of-force reports and complaints filed by/against each officer\r\n\r\nPersonnel records of City employees are confidential pursuant to North Carolina General Statute (NCGS) 160A-168. Furthermore, pursuant to NCGS 160A-168(b)(11), the City is only allowed to release the \"[d]ate type of each dismissal, suspension, or demotion for disciplinary reasons taken by the municipality.  Attached please find copies of the Public Information Reports of CMPD Police Officers assigned as School Resource Officers during the fiscal years 2016-2017 and 2018-2019.\r\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department\r\nPublic Records Request Unit\r\nOffice of the Chief\r\n601 East Trade Street\r\nCharlotte, NC 28202\r\nwww.cmpd.org<http://www.cmpd.org/>\r\nSecurity Information/Law Enforcement Sensitive\r\nFor Official Use Only\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D8E9E6.01058B00]",
