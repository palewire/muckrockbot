We previously submitted a similar request and in hopes of narrowing it down a bit, a case index would be extremely hepful.\r\n\r\nHere, misconduct includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\nExcessive (unreasonable) force \u2013 beatings, manhandling of people in handcuffs, improper use of Tasers, injuries inflicted by police dogs, improper use of deadly force, and other police brutality or disregard for the safety of suspects. It also includes, but is not limited to: physical and verbal abuse, restraints happening unreasonably, coerced or forced confessions, and sexual abuse and assault.\r\n\r\nFalse arrests \u2013 pulling over, detention, questioning and searches conducted without any probable cause whatsoever, including cases of planted evidence, racial profiling and trumped-up charges of resisting arrest.\r\n\r\nLouisiana's Public Records Act does not exclude police disciplinary records from release, even if it violates the officer\u2019s constitutional right to privacy, as ruled by the Louisiana Court of Appeals in its 2008 case of City of Baton Rouge v. Capital City Press.\r\n\r\nAny person who has been denied the right to inspect or copy a record under the provisions of this Chapter, either by a final determination of the custodian or by the passage of five days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays, from the date of his request without receiving a final determination in writing by the custodian, may institute proceedings for the issuance of a writ of mandamus, injunctive or declaratory relief, together with attorney's fees, costs and damages as provided for by this Section, in the district court for the parish in which the office of the custodian is located.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDilcia Mercedes",

Due to a recent high volume of request received by our office, please allow at least thirty days for production of any records that may be available.\u00a0\u00a0Your request was received in this office on\u00a02/13/2023 and assigned the reference number\u00a0P002104-021323 for tracking purposes. \r\n \r\n Records Requested: To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Louisiana Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nUnder the Louisiana Public Records Act \u00a7 44:1 et seq., I am requesting copies of records related to cases of sustained findings of police misconduct at the Baton Rouge Police Department\u2019s Internal Affairs, between 2017 and 2022.\r\nMy organization is specifically interested in a case index for any cases that meet the criteria of the last sentence. We previously submitted a similar request and in hopes of narrowing it down a bit, a case index would be extremely hepful.\r\n\r\nHere, misconduct includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\nExcessive (unreasonable) force \u2013 beatings, manhandling of people in handcuffs, improper use of Tasers, injuries inflicted by police dogs, improper use of deadly force, and other police brutality or disregard for the safety of suspects. It also includes, but is not limited to: physical and verbal abuse, restraints happening unreasonably, coerced or forced confessions, and sexual abuse and assault.\r\n\r\nFalse arrests \u2013 pulling over, detention, questioning and searches conducted without any probable cause whatsoever, including cases of planted evidence, racial profiling and trumped-up charges of resisting arrest.\r\n\r\nLouisiana's Public Records Act does not exclude police disciplinary records from release, even if it violates the officer\u2019s constitutional right to privacy, as ruled by the Louisiana Court of Appeals in its 2008 case of City of Baton Rouge v. Capital City Press.\r\n\r\nAny person who has been denied the right to inspect or copy a record under the provisions of this Chapter, either by a final determination of the custodian or by the passage of five days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays, from the date of his request without receiving a final determination in writing by the custodian, may institute proceedings for the issuance of a writ of mandamus, injunctive or declaratory relief, together with attorney's fees, costs and damages as provided for by this Section, in the district court for the parish in which the office of the custodian is located.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDilcia Mercedes\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fbaton-rouge-police-department-5230%252Flouisiana-public-records-law-request-sustained-findings-since-2017-140492%252F%253Femail%253Dbrla%252540govqa.us&url_auth_token=AAAbwP3wXyfDUJSF6YykvNBj8wI%3A1pRmn6%3A0swuxjap_jKSRl9SvbgKhMdUQ-sGagTG_4fshUCTuW8 \r\nTo the extent the records pertain to an ongoing criminal or administrative investigation/prosecution, the relevant records will not be subject to disclosure pursuant to LSA-R.S. 44:3, unless otherwise deemed releasable pursuant to the BRPD Public Release of Critical Incident Recording Policy. \r\nMonitoring the progress of your request is available by using the link below.\u00a0 Again, thank you for using the City of\u00a0Baton Rouge Public Records Center. \r\n \r\nPLEASE NOTE:\u00a0 Louisiana Public Records Law does not require a governmental body to create a new document in response to a request for public records.",

The email, sent on or about December 4, 2020, from an @icemiller.com email address, to COTA, addressed to Joanna Pinkerton, the subject of which is \"Fare-Free Transit Analysis\" or a variation thereof. I am asking for one specific email (\"the report email\"), not a broad category of records.\r\n2. All attachments included with the report email when it was sent, to iclude cover letters, presentations, images, appendices, PDFs, Word documents, or other files that were included in the report email. This is not a request for a broad or ill-defined category of records, but a request for a specific set of files which are necessary to create a complete copy of a single record.\r\n3. Any replies to the report email that were sent or received by COTA employees within the month after the report email was received. This includes emails in reply thanking the sender for the document, emails forwarding the document to other people \"for your information\", emails assessing whether this report is actionable, and any other email within the one-month time window that has a subject line or envelope metadata indicating that it was a reply or forward. The easiest way for you to find these emails, once you have located the original report email, is to search for the report email's subject field in other emails. This request is not for \"all records containing particular words\", \"all records having to do with a particular topic\", \"all records of a particular type\", \"all emails sent or received by a particular email address with no subject or time limitation\", \"all documents which document any and all instances of a particular topic\", or \"discovery-style requests that seek all records relating to or reflecting certain types of information\" as this request is limited by the type of record, date range, subject matter, chain of causation, and concerns only a specific report.\r\n\r\nCOTA's records retention schedule for all email is 7 years. The responsive emails are less than seven years old, and therefore should be retained by COTA.\r\n\r\nIf this information is insufficient to identify the responsive records, then pursuant to ORC 149.43(B)(2) I request information on the manner in which records are retained by COTA and its Office of the President and accessed in the ordinary course of the office's duties.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBenjamin Keith",
