        "communication": "Good day,\r\n\r\nThis is in regards to your TSA FOIA request, 2021-TSFO-00418 (see attached). To search for records for this request, it would take a combined search time of 162 hours. We estimate costs of $4,536 for the continued processing of your request. In accordance with the DHS implementing regulations, 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11, fee estimates that exceed $250 may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. If you agree to this fee assessment, we are requesting an advance payment of fifty percent (50%) of the entire current anticipated fee which is $4,536.\r\n\r\nFee Estimate Breakdown:\r\nSearch time at $28 per hour (first two hours are free): $4,536\r\nProfessional review time at $28 per hour: no cost estimate at this time\r\nDuplication is .10 per page: no charge for electronic records\r\n\r\nThis is just an estimate. The final invoice will reflect the actual time expended which could be less than the estimate. If we expect the estimate amount to increase, we will contact you directly before incurring any additional fees. We will provide you with the final invoice with our final release of records.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, you may:\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Provide us with written assurance of your willingness to pay $4,536 for the processing of your request, or\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Agree in writing to pay some additional amount that is lower than our estimate of $4,536 for the processing of your request, and/or\r\n\r\n\u00b7         Reduce the scope of your request, so as to limit the amount of time that would be required to process your request, such that your fee does not exceed the amount that you have agreed to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive your fee agreement within 30 business days of the date of this email, which is June 28, 2021, we will administratively close out your requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like help reformulating your request, please contact me directly at Michael.tobias@tsa.dhs.gov<mailto:Michael.tobias@tsa.dhs.gov>. I am also available for phone meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response regarding your fee agreement by March 24, 2021.\r\n\r\nThank you and have a great day!\r\n\nMichael Tobias\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\r\nTransportation Security Administration (TSA)\r\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) Branch\r\nCRL/OTE/TED",

When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.   You reference \u201canother FOIA request,\u201d and I am advising you that The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (FOIA) applies only to federal agencies and does not create a right of access to records held by local government agencies.  The City is processing your records request pursuant to the Colorado Open Records Act, C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-200.1, et seq. (CORA).  Please note that pursuant to C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-205(3), the City may charge a fee not in excess of the original fee charged to a previous person requesting the same or similar records.  The City\u2019s fees are set by a resolution approved by the City Council and all CORA requests are charged the same fee rate.\r\n\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.  The City\u2019s fees are set by a resolution approved by the City Council and all CORA requests are charged the same fee rate.  The City Council policy does not provide staff with discretion to charge a different fee for different requesting parties.  Electronic copies of records are not charged per page or per record, but rather the fee is based upon the time it takes the staff to research and retrieve the record, which fee is standard and is determined by the City Council by resolution.\r\n\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.  Neither CORA nor the City CORA policy require the City to consider the economic circumstances of the requesting party, and the City does not consider the use to which the requesting party will make of the requested records.\r\n\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified. As stated previously, FOIA is not applicable to the City of Cortez.  The City does not consider the use to which the requesting party will make of the requested records.\r\n\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into considideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.  The City CORA policy and the fees charged are specified by resolution of the City Council, and the staff does not have the discretion to deviate from the fees required in the resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinda L.

Request:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached PDF document labeled: 24.04.10 Jeter 11a Request Text.pdf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.                                         Response:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City processed this request pursuant to the Colorado Open Records Act, C.R.S. 24-72-200.1, et seq. (\u201cCORA\u201d).  Pursuant to CORA, there is no charge for the first hour of time spent by the City retrieving and reviewing records, and all time thereafter is charged at $33.58 per hour.  This response required 10.08 hours of staff time, so minus the first hour, for which there is no charge, the total amount owed is $304.91.  You paid a deposit of $134.32, so the remaining balance owed is $170.59.  The total number of email records produced is 103, and the total number of attachment records produced is 45.  Please provide payment to the Cortez City Clerk in the amount of $170.59, and I will send you digital copies of all of the requested records.\r\n\r\n\r\nLinda L.

As stated in the Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance Factsheet,  \u201cFusion Centers are owned and operated by state and local entities with support from federal partners\u2026\u201d Given that Fusion Centers are intelligence hubs that gather, analyze and share sensitive information about citizens throughout the state and regions of Missouri, it is essential that the public can see accountability and transparency are prioritized in the day-to-day functions of organizations such as the St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group. \r\n\r\nRequested Documents/Records:\r\n\r\nI request that you provide me access to, or copies of: \r\n\r\n1.\tDocuments/records sufficient to show the name and location of the most current appointed custodian of records for the St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group. Please include the custodian\u2019s first/last name, title, physical location with room, street address, city, state, email address and direct phone number with extension.  \r\n\r\n2.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group\u2019s manual of all policies and procedures for processing Missouri Sunshine Law requests. If no manual exists, please provide all other guiding documentation/protocols for the processing of Missouri Sunshine Law requests.  \r\n\r\n3.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group\u2019s reasonably written policies (in compliance with sections 610.010 to 610.030, RSMo, commonly referred to as the Missouri Sunshine Law) that instructs members of the public on how to request access to public records that are held by the St. Louis Fusion Center: Terrorism Early Warning Group.    \r\n\r\n4.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show why and how Missouri Sunshine Law public records requests that are addressed to the St Louis Fusion Center: Early Terrorism Early Warning Group, and clearly intended to be received and processed by the St Louis Fusion Center: Early Terrorism Early Warning Group are being diverted to the St Louis County Police Department and/or \u201cSt Louis County.\u201d    \r\n\r\n5.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show why and how Missouri Sunshine Law public records requests that are addressed to the St Louis Fusion Center: Early Terrorism Early Warning Group, and clearly intended to be received and processed by the St Louis Fusion Center: Early Terrorism Early Warning Group are being denied and closed by the St Louis County Police Department and/or \u201cSt Louis County\u201d for reasons of \u201cno documents responsive\u201d to the requests, when initial requests are not addressed to, sent to, or seeking documents from the St Louis County Police Department or \u201cSt Louis County.\u201d     \r\n\r\nRequested Format\r\n\r\nI am respectfully seeking all documents/records through MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply. \r\n\r\nI am requesting that documents/records be sent electronically, preferably as a PDF file attachment. I also request that documents/records be sent in any digital format in which they exist (such as PDF or Excel). If unable to fill the request electronically, please advise me of other alternatives.  \r\n\r\nPer Section 610.024, RSMo, \u201cIf a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the public governmental body shall separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for examination and copying.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf portions of the requested documents/records are closed due to exemption, please segregate the closed portions and provide me with all segregable portions of the documents/records. I also request that you please provide a detailed justification for each redaction or omission, and cite the specific exemption used for each redacted or omitted portion of the original document/records.   \r\n\r\nFee Waiver/Public Interest/Public Release\r\n\r\nAs the records sought detail the operations and activities of local and state government bodies, I also request that fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public\u2019s interest. I am seeking the records to analyze, inform and freely release to members of the public as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com. \r\n\r\nAs stated in Section 610.022, RSMo, \u201cpublic records shall be presumed to be open\u2026documents may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThe subject of the requested documents/records will provide significant increased insight about local and state governmental body\u2019s operations and/or activities around access to public records/documents. The requested records are not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nIf fees cannot be waived, I am willing to pay all reasonable duplication expenses incurred in the processing this Missouri Sunshine Law request. However, as I am a member of the public and requesting documents specifically for the purpose of increasing the public\u2019s knowledge of governmental functioning, I will administratively appeal any denial of my request for a fee waiver. If fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Hawkins",

Your request was received in this office on 5/12/2023.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.If you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Fernando Pineiro Jr. at the address above or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-25796.

You are seeking all agency FOIA logs for the period from October 1, 2021 through May 11, 2023, in native format. \r\n\r\nThese documents are on the ICE website at www.ice.gov/foia/library. \r\n\r\nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \r\n\r\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nICE FOIA",

They also said:\r\n\r\n\"You may wish to direct your search to the New York City Office of Technology and Innovation\".\r\n\r\nHence, I am expecting relevant records from this agency.\r\n\r\nNow that more than two years have passed since I began this effort, I have considerably less patience for illegal delays. I wish to be as clear as I can be about this: I have no ill will whatsoever for the likely-overworked records access employees, but for the agencies which make it difficult to do your jobs in a timely manner. You may expect me to appeal on grounds of constructive denial should the request be illegally delayed.\r\n\r\nThe request for records, which I am now directing to this agency is:\r\nRecords relating to the total number of restaurants inspected for compliance with state pandemic air filtration and ventilating guidance.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed portable filtration or UVGI instead of MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that were operating the installed filtration or UVGI systems when inspected. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have other mitigation measures in place, when MERV 13 filtration, UVGI, and portable filtration, was not in place. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the number restaurants that have been found to be or are currently out of compliance with air filtration and ventilating guidance. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould no such records exist, I request information on what records and/or statistics are collected regarding air filtration and ventilating guidance enforcement.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, should they be available, records of the actual inspections and results.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER RICCIO",

        "communication": "Your request FOIL-2023-858-00359 has been successfully submitted to the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI).\r\n                                The details of your request are shown below. \r\n \r\nRequest Title: Air filtration and ventilation guidance enforcement \r\n \r\nRequest Description: To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nIn September 2021, during discussions of fulfilling DOHMH FOIL Control #: 2021FR01203, the records access officer said \"the Mayor's Office of Operations and the Mayor's Office of Data Analytics would have more comprehensive data on this and the remaining items of your request\".\r\n\r\nIn October 2023, after more than two years and a breached deadline set by their own appeals officer, the Office Of The Mayor responded to FOIL 2021-002-00656 and FOIL 2021-002, with a shockingly short list of about 60 inspections. They also said:\r\n\r\n\"You may wish to direct your search to the New York City Office of Technology and Innovation\".\r\n\r\nHence, I am expecting relevant records from this agency.\r\n\r\nNow that more than two years have passed since I began this effort, I have considerably less patience for illegal delays. I wish to be as clear as I can be about this: I have no ill will whatsoever for the likely-overworked records access employees, but for the agencies which make it difficult to do your jobs in a timely manner. You may expect me to appeal on grounds of constructive denial should the request be illegally delayed.\r\n\r\nThe request for records, which I am now directing to this agency is:\r\nRecords relating to the total number of restaurants inspected for compliance with state pandemic air filtration and ventilating guidance.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed portable filtration or UVGI instead of MERV 13 filters. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that were operating the installed filtration or UVGI systems when inspected. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have other mitigation measures in place, when MERV 13 filtration, UVGI, and portable filtration, was not in place. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to the number restaurants that have been found to be or are currently out of compliance with air filtration and ventilating guidance. Also include summary statistics of the results and descriptions of the data/columns.\r\n\r\nShould no such records exist, I request information on what records and/or statistics are collected regarding air filtration and ventilating guidance enforcement.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, should they be available, records of the actual inspections and results.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nALEXANDER RICCIO\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Finformation-technology-new-york-14842%252Fair-filtration-and-ventilation-guidance-enforcement-154432%252F%253Femail%253Dnoreply%252540nyc.gov&url_auth_token=AABCUuV-4IYMaBThH4C3bwri3dk%3A1r1I7M%3As746NmxyqA5uebm7VT6APEjGG1lm71f57UVkOfWb3lw \r\n \r\n \r\nRequester's Contact Information \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Name: \r\n Alexander Riccio \r\n \r\n Title: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Organization: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Email: \r\n  154432-69389349@requests.muckrock.com (mailto:154432-69389349@requests.muckrock.com) \r\n \r\n Phone Number: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Fax Number: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Street Address (line 1): \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Street Address (line 2): \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n City: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n State: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\n Zip Code: \r\n Not provided \r\n \r\nYou can view the request and take any necessary action at the following webpage: https://a860-openrecords.nyc.gov/request/view/FOIL-2023-858-00359.

Can you tell me what's been redacted?\r\n\r\nAre there any descriptions or notes available in city records for the columns?\r\n\r\nWho was the records holder/owner for this dataset? Who was responsible for maintaining it.\r\n\r\nThere are easily tens of thousands of establishments for which many fields are empty. Is data missing? Have those fields been withheld?\r\n\r\nOne local establishment, the Beach Cafe on 2nd, has yes entries for symptom screening, soap, and many related surface sanitation checks, but empty fields for ventilation and filtration checks. I don't see a yes or no - just blank.\r\n\r\nSome establishments that should be in this dataset appear to be missing. I'm using my my favorite pizza place as a sanity check, pizza park on 1233 first avenue, and am struggling to find it. Is there any reason it would be missing or withheld?",

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact FOIA/PA Unit representative Fantasia L. Hogan-Bassey-Graham at (571) 776-2210 or via e-mail at Fantasia.L.Hogan-Bassey-Graham@dea.gov, our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public.\u00a0 You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

        "communication": "Dear William Fernandes:\r\n\u200b\r\n            This e-mail responds to your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) request dated April 2, 2022, received by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), FOIA/PA Unit, seeking access to DEA records.  Your request has been opened and assigned the following case number: 23-00303-F.  Please include this case number when communicating with this office.\r\n\r\nYour request as written does not meet the requirements of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(3)(A), since they do not reasonably describe records.  The Department of Justice rules, contained at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.3, provide that \u201cyou must describe the records in enough detail to enable department personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort\u201d and when possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought such as the date, title or name, author and subject matter of the record.  These specifics are important to determine the extent and scope of the search, and to determine the records that are responsive.  DEA can make certain presumptions to overcome some of the deficiencies in your request, but not all of them.\r\n\r\nTo retrieve the information that you may be seeking requires more specificity.  Under the FOIA, an agency is not required to conduct research.  DEA maintains several types of records and records systems (i.e., regulatory, personnel, investigative, etc.).  For example, in your letter, you are requesting Any and all expense records for travel into the State of Nevada for the period 2020.,\u201d yet you have not specified a particular DEA office that you wish searched; or the type of record that would be responsive to your request.  Be advised that DEA has 239 Domestic Offices in 23 Divisions throughout the United States, and 92 foreign offices in 69 countries, and more than 150 Headquarters Offices.  Since your description did not limit the search to a specific office or area, a vast majority of DEA offices would be tasked to conduct a search of their respective offices for any responsive records pertaining to the subject of your request.  As such, your request is overly broad and burdensome.\r\n\r\nPlease specify the following:\r\n\r\n  1.  Clarify the type of travel (TDY and/or Extended TDY travel)\r\n  2.  Verify the timeframe for \u201c2020\u201d (calendar year Jan-December or fiscal year Oct 2019 \u2013 Sept 2020)\r\n  3.  Do you also want the information to include the PCS travel when core employees move?\r\n\r\nTo this end, no further action will be initiated on this request until we are in receipt of the above documentation.  Upon receipt, we will conduct a query of the Investigative Reporting and Filing System (IRFS).  IRFS is the system of records that contains all administrative, general and investigative files compiled by DEA for law enforcement purposes.  If this office does not receive your response within 30 business days, DEA will assume that you do not wish to pursue this matter and your request will be administratively closed.  Please e-mail your response to fantasia.l.hogan-bassey-graham@dea.gov<mailto:fantasia.l.hogan-bassey-graham@dea.gov>.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with DEA\u2019s determination in response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website:  https://www.justice.gov/oip/submit-and-track-request-or-appeal.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request.  If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal.\"\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this email, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300.

The FBI and OIG both made FOIA productions about their spending for travel into the Silver State of Nevada.  The DEA offices continues to refuse to produce records in relation to spending and this was during the COVID peak.  \r\n\r\nAt this time the DEA was pandering to other law enforcement agencies (in CA) offering assistance to locate people, which is an advertisement that it did not have enough of its own work to do.  \r\n\r\nThe DOJ OIP refuses to govern the DEA about this which generally is a corruption indicator. Something in the expenses to be inspected. \r\n\r\nI also requested the OIP Background report, which the agency DEA obstructed and only, sent back a portion which was the appeal submitted.\r\n\r\nI think this agency should be defunded and its duties passed to DHS, CBO, FBI, HHS. \r\n\r\nRecords are available publicly here:\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/expenses-127054/\r\n",

It should noted that case sensitive searches are not possible, so the term \"Anonymous\" returns both references to the group \"Anonymous\" as well as any reference to anonymous tips, informants, etc. As we can't segregate between the two meanings of the word, USMS would have to manually review every single document just to identify the possibly responsive files. To that end, USMS would like to request that you narrow the scope of the request so that we can continue to process your request. One suggestion would be to remove the term \"Anonymous\" from the search terms and just proceed with variations of \"hack\" (which would include variations of hacker, hacktivist, hacktivism), but we are open to suggestions. \n\nYour request in currently being placed in a pending yourresponse. Please note, if your response is not received Hold Status, , it will be administratively closed. within 30 days Thank you, \n\nERT for \nUSMSFOIA Administrative Team Freedom of Information/Privacy Act Office \nOffice of General Counsel\n",

As stated in the Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance Factsheet, \u201cFusion Centers are owned and operated by state and local entities with support from federal partners\u2026\u201d \r\n\r\nPer the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) website, \u201cThe Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) is recognized by the U. S. Department of Homeland Security as the Primary Fusion Center for the state of Missouri.\u201d \r\n\r\nGiven that Fusion Centers are intelligence hubs that gather, analyze and share sensitive information about citizens throughout the state and regions of Missouri, it is essential that the public can see accountability and transparency are prioritized in the day-to-day functions of organizations such as the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC).\r\n\r\nRequested Documents/Records:\r\n\r\nI request that you provide me access to, or copies of: \r\n\r\n1.\tDocuments/records sufficient to show the name and location of the most current appointed custodian of records for the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC). Please include the custodian\u2019s first/last name, title, physical location with room, street address, city, state, email address and direct phone number with extension.  \r\n\r\n2.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show the Missouri Information Analysis Center\u2019s manual of all policies and procedures for processing Missouri Sunshine Law requests. If no manual exists, please provide all other guiding documentation/protocols for the processing of Missouri Sunshine Law requests.  \r\n\r\n3.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show the Missouri Information Analysis Center\u2019s reasonably written policies (in compliance with sections 610.010 to 610.030, RSMo, commonly referred to as the Missouri Sunshine Law) that instructs members of the public on how to request access to public records that are held by the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC).\r\n\r\n4.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show why and how Missouri Sunshine Law public records requests that are addressed to the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), and clearly intended to be received and processed by the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), are being diverted to the Missouri State Highway Patrol.     \r\n\r\n5.\tAll documents/records sufficient to show why and how Missouri Sunshine Law public records requests that are addressed to the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), and clearly intended to be received and processed by the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), are being denied and closed by the Missouri State Highway Patrol for reasons of \u201cno documents responsive\u201d to the requests, when initial requests are not addressed to, sent to, or seeking documents from the Missouri State Highway Patrol. \r\n\r\nRequested Format\r\n\r\nI am respectfully seeking all documents/records through MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply. \r\n\r\nI am requesting that documents/records be sent electronically, preferably as a PDF file attachment. I also request that documents/records be sent in any digital format in which they exist (such as PDF or Excel). If unable to fill the request electronically, please advise me of other alternatives.  \r\n\r\nPer Section 610.024, RSMo, \u201cIf a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure as well as material which is exempt from disclosure, the public governmental body shall separate the exempt and nonexempt material and make the nonexempt material available for examination and copying.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf portions of the requested documents/records are closed due to exemption, please segregate the closed portions and provide me with all segregable portions of the documents/records. I also request that you please provide a detailed justification for each redaction or omission, and cite the specific exemption used for each redacted or omitted portion of the original document/records.   \r\n\r\nFee Waiver/Public Interest/Public Release\r\n\r\nAs the records sought detail the operations and activities of local and state government bodies, I also request that fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public\u2019s interest. I am seeking the records to analyze, inform and freely release to members of the public as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com. \r\n\r\nAs stated in Section 610.022, RSMo, \u201cpublic records shall be presumed to be open\u2026documents may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThe subject of the requested documents/records will provide significant increased insight about local and state governmental body\u2019s operations and/or activities around access to public records/documents. The requested records are not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nIf fees cannot be waived, I am willing to pay all reasonable duplication expenses incurred in the processing this Missouri Sunshine Law request. However, as I am a member of the public and requesting documents specifically for the purpose of increasing the public\u2019s knowledge of governmental functioning, I will administratively appeal any denial of my request for a fee waiver. If fees cannot be waived, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Hawkins",

        "communication": "Dear Kevin Hawkins: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P050008-060524.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G.

I request any and all documents pertaining to DoD involvement with the production of the \"Legacy\"-John Williams documentary. Such documents may include but should not be limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of DoD and members of the cast, crew, and production company of the documentary, including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nAttached is a list, released to me through FOIA by DoD, of TV and movie productions supported by DoD in 2023; \"John Williams LEGACY documentary\" is included on that list.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Galante,\r\n\r\nReference is made to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request #1412777-000 for FBI records concerning File 062-HQ-62736, Postal Censorship.  The FBI has located approximately 83,000 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-100 page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing.  Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 134 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 523 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,335 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 1,875 days for processing.  \r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request large processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is June 2025.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  If you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please respond to this email.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n540-868-4894\r\nStatus check?

I am appealing all applied exemptions in the records provided, particularly the application of b7e to records that are, at the time of my receiving them, eighty-three years old. The Bureau has previously disclosed law enforcement and intelligence techniques of this era, to include the interception of privileged diplomatic communications and collaboration with allied foreign intelligence services, methods that at the time would be highly damaging if disclosed but currently hold no value by remaining secret. The exemptions as applied in this release strain credulity and are prima facie absurd. I appreciate your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPaul Galante",

Such documents may include but should not be limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of DoD and the cast, crew, and production company of the \"American Dreamer\" music video, including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nAttached is a list, released to me through FOIA by DoD, of TV and movie productions supported by DoD in 2023; \"Matt Tucker - American Dreamer\" is included on that list.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

Your request was received by the Reference Branch\r\n(RR2RR) on December 15, 2023 with the assigned tracking number 24-13240.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have searched our holdings in Record Group 24: Records of the Bureau of\r\nNaval Personnel, Record Group 38: Records of the Chief of Naval Operations,\r\nRecord Group 218: Records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Record Group\r\n457: Records of the National Security Agency and we have located some\r\nmaterials that are relevant to your topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn RG 24, we were able to locate the June 1967\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/215475147> deck log of the USS *Liberty*\r\n(AGTR 5) on the National Archives Catalog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn RG 38, we were able to locate files on the *Liberty* Incident in Entry P\r\n25: Records on Attacks, Accidents, and Other Topics of the Office of the\r\nChief of Information (CHINFO) in Box 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn RG 457, we were able to locate a report on the *Liberty* Incident in\r\nEntry A1 9002: Studies on Cryptology in SRH-256: Attack on the *Liberty*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are forwarding your request to the National Declassification Center for\r\na report in RG 218 in Chairman General Earl G.

We would recommend that you or a representative\r\nworking on your behalf make an appointment to visit our facility to review\r\nthese records in person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords in our custody contain a number of files that include information\r\non your topic. We regret that we are not staffed to conduct the extensive\r\nresearch necessary to identify all pertinent records relating to your\r\nrequest within the suggested record groups and their record series.  We\r\nwould be happy to make them available to you or your representative in our\r\nresearch room.  Should you be unable to come to the National Archives you\r\nmay wish to hire a professional researcher.  We are attaching a link to a\r\nlist of some of these researchers.\r\nhttps://www.archives.gov/research/hire-help\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make an appointment to visit the National Archives, please visit the Textual\r\nResearch Room Appointments\r\n<https://www.eventbrite.com/cc/textual-research-room-appointments-487599>\r\npage if you are interested in accessing textual records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll researchers must register for a NARA Researcher Card. Researchers are\r\nfurther encouraged to pre-register in advance of a visit. This process\r\nconsists of two parts, including completing the Online Researcher\r\nOrientation\r\n<https://rise.articulate.com/share/uK5NGkSpg74JHLTOcGPmM4e94MJyxQgD#/>\r\nand Online\r\nKiosk Registration\r\n<https://researchercommunity.force.com/securitycentral/s/kiosk-registration>\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou asked for a waiver of the fees normally charged for providing\r\nresearchers with copies of archival records. The fee and fee waiver\r\nprovisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), however, do not apply\r\nto archival records. The FOIA fee section states that \"Nothing in this\r\nsubparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable under a statute specifically\r\nproviding for setting the level of fees for particular types of records.\"\r\n[5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(vi)]. Accordingly, the NARA fee statute, 44 U.S.C.\r\n2116(c), and implementing regulations at 36 C.F.R. Part 1258, apply\r\nexclusively to your request, under which the National Archives does not\r\nwaive reproduction charges for individual requesters. Our inability to\r\ngrant you the requested fee waiver does not constitute a denial for the\r\npurposes of the FOIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this a denial of your FOIA request.  However, if you are\r\nnot satisfied with our action on this request, your options for appeal and\r\ndispute resolution are outlined in the attached enclosure.  If you have any\r\nquestions, you may reach us at archives2reference@nara.gov.

However, I have since received correspondence from David Fort, Deputy Director of the FOIA/MDR Division at the National Archives and Records Administration, indicating that the case was closed based on previous communication.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, I kindly request an update on the status of my FOIA request.

        "communication": "Dear U.S. Navy:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. \r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\nI am seeking records related to the Navy and Marine Corps energy conservation mascot, a light bulb named Brite. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Please produce all records related to the conception, development, creation, and design of the Brite mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to the military's decision to create an energy conservation mascot in the first place. \r\n\r\nNote: According to the attached records, Brite was developed by members of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Northwest, Public Works Department in Kitsap, Washington. So please be sure to search there.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Brite-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, photographs, videos, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any life-size Brite costume (pictured in the attached records). Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Brite.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all correspondence related to Brite (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. U.S. Senator Jodi Ernst (R-IA) may have sent some responsive records. \r\n\r\n6. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision by the Navy or Marine Corps to stop using Brite as part of its public outreach.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

Please produce all records related to the conception, development, creation, and design of the Brite mascot. Please include any contracts or design concepts (e.g. sketches) in your production, as well as any records related to the military's decision to create an energy conservation mascot in the first place.\r\n\r\nNote: According to the attached records, Brite was developed by members of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Northwest, Public Works Department in Kitsap, Washington. So please be sure to search there.\r\n\r\n2. Please produce all Brite-related promotional items, educational items, or tchotchkes, past or present, that took the form of records, such as trading cards, posters, photographs, videos, or books (including but not limited to coloring books, activity books, or comic books).\r\n\r\n3. Please produce all records related to the conception, creation, design, and use of any life-size Brite costume (pictured in the attached records). Responsive records would include contracts for the design or production of such a costume; design proposals or sketches; correspondence with the designer or manufacturer; and any guidelines related to the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n4. Please produce all communications related to Brite.\r\n\r\n5. Please produce all correspondence related to Brite (or to mascots in general) sent to or from any member of Congress, their office, or their staff. U.S. Senator Jodi Ernst (R-IA) may have sent some responsive records.\r\n\r\n6. Please produce all records related to any proposal or decision by the Navy or Marine Corps to stop using Brite as part of its public outreach.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

A recent news report by Volkskrant (https://volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/aivd-speelde-cruciale-rol-bij-sabotage-kernprogramma-iran~ba24df9f/) named him as a Dutch intelligence asset.\r\n\r\nVan Sabben's death was widely reported (https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/engineer-who-helped-build-the-maqta-bridge-1.553285). As such, privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 are voided, as are any concerns under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nIf any part of these documents are exempt from disclosure, please be sure to review and release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of responsive documents, as the FOIA requires.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Petti",

After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, CBP has determined that they are approved for release in their entirety, no deletions or exemptions have been applied. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 90 K St, NE MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2024-070821 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

This response applies only to records that exist and are in the custody of the City. See A Guide to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, p. 32, n.115.\u00a0 It is expected that a custodian of records must use her superior knowledge of her records concerning responses to public records requests.\u00a0 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u00a0 Specifically, you stated: To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\n1. Any recordings (including video and audio captured by body cameras, vehicle-mounted devices, or handheld devices) concerning interactions with demonstrators at or near Emerson College on April 24 and/or 25, 2024. \r\n\r\n2. Any incident reports or after-incident reports resulting from the demonstrations at or near Emerson College on April 24 and/or 25, 2024. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage. \r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fboston-police-department-174%252Femerson-college-protest-arrests-april-24-2024-162648%252F%253Femail%253Dshawn.williams%252540boston.gov&url_auth_token=AAAj3ZlQ8Z6owDLMtztfSTxotfQ%3A1s0AUG%3ApT69OJ66wmWpp2i4VBcrexOuhr69ndl_9Bin5jGkllA The Department located records that are responsive to your request. Two incident reports have been uploaded. There are redactions to these reports of personally identifiable information for specifically identified persons, including date of birth, Social Security Numbers, home addresses, and phone numbers.\u00a0 Also, the name and identifying information of a juvenile are redacted under Exemption (a) of the Public Records Law in order to protect the identity of juveniles.\u00a0 Exemption (a) applies to records that are specifically or by necessary implication exempted from disclosure by statute.\u00a0 G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a). \u00a0 A government entity may use the statutory exemption as a basis for withholding requested materials where the exempting statute expressly states or necessarily implies that the public\u2019s right to inspect records under the Public Records Law is restricted.\u00a0 Att\u2019y Gen. v. Collector of Lynn, 377 Mass. 151, 154 (1979); Ottaway Newspapers, Inc. v. Appeals Court, 372 Mass. 539, 545-46 (1977).\u00a0 This exemption establishes two categories of exempted records.\u00a0 The first category consists of records that are expressly exempt from disclosure by statute where the language of the statute will provide that such record \"shall not be a public record\" or have similar language referring to the confidentiality of the record.\u00a0 The second category under the exemption includes records deemed exempt under statute by necessary implication.\u00a0 G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a). \r\nThe Department redacted the name of the juvenile under the second category where records are exempted by necessary implication pursuant to G.L. c. 41 \u00a7 98F which expressly provides that entries on police logs concerning arrests of a person under the age of 18 shall be kept separately, shall not be a public record nor shall such entry be disclosed to the public.\u00a0 See G.L. c. 41 ss.98F.\u00a0 While the record you are seeking is not an entry in the daily police log, it does relate to an arrest of a juvenile; therefore, by necessary implication, this information is not public and the Department redacted information relating to the juvenile. The Department located body-worn camera videos from 1:34 AM to 2:26 AM, totaling 228 hours.\u00a0 However, the Department is denying this portion of your request pursuant to the investigatory exemption to the public records law because the records you seek are related to an ongoing open investigation, and their release at this time will prejudice effective law enforcement. \u00a0 A records custodian may withhold records concerning investigatory materials necessarily compiled out of public view by law enforcement officials where the disclosure of such materials would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that releasing the records is not in the public interest. See G. L.\u00a0 c.4,\u00a0 \u00a7 7(26) (f). \r\nThe Department recognizes that exemption (f) does not create a blanket exemption of all investigative materials created and maintained by police departments. See Dist. Attorney for the Norfolk Dist. v. Flatley, 419 Mass. 507, 512 (1995) ; WBZ-TV4 v. Dist. Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., 408 Mass. 595, 603 (1990) .\u00a0 Exemption (f) does not exempt all investigatory materials but rather requires a case-by-case analysis of whether disclosure would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that releasing the records is not in the public interest. See Reinstein v. Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, 378 Mass. 281, 289-90 (1979) . \r\nUnder the public records law, there is a presumption that the record sought is public, and the burden is on the custodian to prove with specificity how the exemption applies.\u00a0 G. L.\u00a0 c. 66\u00a0 \u00a710 (c).\u00a0 Records custodians may withhold records relating to an ongoing investigation if the release of such records would disclose confidential investigative techniques, procedures or sources of information. See Bougas v. Chief of Police of Lexington, 371 Mass. 59, 354 N.E.2d 872 (1976) .\u00a0 An essential part of the investigatory process includes a dialogue between police departments, individual citizens, and potential witnesses.\u00a0 Exemption (f) contemplates that individual citizens should be encouraged to come forward and speak freely with police concerning matters under investigation and the creation of initiative that police officers might be completely candid in recording their observations, hypotheses, and interim conclusions. Id . \r\nThe Department denies your request because the records are part of open Internal Affairs Department (IAD) investigations and criminal proceedings; disclosure will prejudice future law enforcement efforts for the reasons stated below.\u00a0 Disclosure of the requested records would interfere with enforcement proceedings.\u00a0 The body-worn camera videos are part of the investigation of this incident. Disclosure would prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that such disclosure is not in the public interest.\u00a0 Disclosure would prejudice effective law enforcement because officers and other prospective witnesses have not been interviewed. Disclosure would disclose confidential investigative techniques, procedures, or sources of information.\u00a0 Disclosure could inhibit the investigatory process by discouraging potential witnesses from coming forward or influencing witness statements. \u00a0 Encouraging citizens and prospective witnesses to come forward and speak with police and allowing the police department to establish trust with the community are essential elements of the investigatory process and effective law enforcement.\u00a0 Without this collaborative component, investigations will become more difficult.\u00a0 The collaboration between the public and the police and encouraging the public to cooperate with police investigations are reasons contemplated by the investigatory exemption.\u00a0 The investigatory process will be hampered if prospective witnesses do not come forward.\u00a0 Such a result will prejudice future law enforcement efforts and the possibility of effective law enforcement, which is not in the public interest.\u00a0 Further, releasing this record at this time may influence potential witnesses, thereby compromising the investigatory process.\u00a0 The Department is denying your request to protect the integrity of the investigative process and information relating to confidential investigative techniques, procedures, and sources and to maintain the ability to foster cooperation with the public.\u00a0 These records are part of an ongoing investigation, and their disclosure would prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement; therefore, disclosure of the requested record is not in the public interest.\u00a0 Disclosure of this record would also have a chilling effect on future law enforcement efforts. \r\nA records custodian is obligated to provide segregable portions of records where possible. See Globe Newspaper Co. v. Exec. Office of Admin. and Fin. , Suffolk Sup. No. 11-01184- A (June 14, 2013).\u00a0 However, providing segregable portions of the requested records is impossible without revealing confidential investigative techniques, procedures, or sources of information . Withholding this record is necessary to prevent interference with enforcement proceedings.\u00a0 The disclosure would prejudice effective law enforcement and not be in the public interest.\u00a0 Once the IAD investigation and criminal investigations are concluded, the Department may reevaluate its position if you wish to make another public records request. \r\nYou may appeal this response to the Supervisor of Records in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10A (c); G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(b)(ix); 950 CMR 32.08; 950 CMR 32.08(1)(h) (in petitioning the Supervisor, the requester shall provide a copy of such petition to the records access officer associated with such petition). You may also appeal to the Superior Court. 950 CMR 32.06(3)(c).  Sincerely, \r\nChristine O\u2019Donnell Assistant Corporation Counsel Office of the Legal Advisor Boston Police Department",

Four-hundred twenty-four responsive emails are redacted to omit personally identifiable information for specifically identified persons, including names, date of birth, Social Security Numbers, home addresses, and phone numbers.\u00a0 Such portions are deemed intimate details of a highly personal nature.\u00a0 The public interest in disclosure does not outweigh the privacy interest these individuals hold.\u00a0 The information is not available from another public source. G. L.\u00a0 c.4,\u00a0 \u00a7 7(26) (c). Fifteen responsive email records consist of attorney-client privileged communications. Suffolk Const. Co., Inc. v. Division of Capital Asset Management , 449 Mass. 444 (2007). These records shall be withheld entirely.\u00a0 A records custodian must satisfy a three-part test in establishing the attorney-client privilege. See  Suffolk Constr. Co. v. Div. of Capital Asset Mgmt. , 449 Mass. 444 (2007); see also SPR18/423 Determination of the Supervisor of Records (April 11, 2018).\u00a0 The Suffolk Court\u2019s holding imposes a burden on a records custodian of \u201cnot only proving the existence of an attorney-client relationship but also (1) that the communications were received from a client during the client\u2019s search for legal advice from the attorney in his capacity as such; (2) that the communications were made in confidence; and (3) that the privilege as to these communications has not been waived.\u201d See SPR18/423 (April 11, 2018), p2.\u00a0 The withheld records consist solely of communications between City employees and their attorneys. Such records contain information between an attorney and client related to \u201cthe client\u2019s search for legal advice from the attorney in his capacity as such.\u201d All of these communications \u201cwere made in confidence.\u201d\u00a0 In all cases \u201cthe privilege as to these communications has not been waived.\u201d\u00a0 The Client is the City of Boston. Forty-five responsive emails consist of information associated with open Boston Police Department Internal Affairs Department (IAD) investigations and criminal proceedings.\u00a0 These records shall be withheld entirely.\u00a0\u00a0The release will prejudice effective law enforcement. Records custodians may withhold records under the investigatory exemption relating to an ongoing investigation if the release of such records would disclose confidential investigative techniques, procedures, or sources of information. See G. L.\u00a0 c.4,\u00a0 \u00a7 7(26) (f); Bougas v. Chief of Police of Lexington, 371 Mass. 59, 354 N.E.2d 872 (1976) .\u00a0 An essential part of the investigatory process includes a dialogue between police departments, individual citizens, and potential witnesses.\u00a0 Exemption (f) contemplates that individual citizens should be encouraged to come forward and speak freely with police concerning matters under investigation and the creation of an initiative that police officers might be completely candid in recording their observations, hypotheses, and interim conclusions. Id Two incident reports have been uploaded. There are redactions to these reports of personally identifiable information for specifically identified persons, including date of birth, Social Security Numbers, home addresses, and phone numbers.\u00a0 Also, the name and identifying information of a juvenile are redacted under Exemption (a) of the Public Records Law in order to protect the identity of juveniles.\u00a0 Exemption (a) applies to records that are specifically or by necessary implication exempted from disclosure by statute.\u00a0 G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a). \u00a0 A government entity may use the statutory exemption as a basis for withholding requested materials where the exempting statute expressly states or necessarily implies that the public\u2019s right to inspect records under the Public Records Law is restricted.\u00a0 Att\u2019y Gen. v. Collector of Lynn, 377 Mass. 151, 154 (1979); Ottaway Newspapers, Inc. v. Appeals Court, 372 Mass. 539, 545-46 (1977).\u00a0 This exemption establishes two categories of exempted records.\u00a0 The first category consists of records that are expressly exempt from disclosure by statute where the language of the statute will provide that such record \"shall not be a public record\" or have similar language referring to the confidentiality of the record.\u00a0 The second category under the exemption includes records deemed exempt under statute by necessary implication.\u00a0 G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a). \r\nThe Department redacted the name of the juvenile under the second category where records are exempted by necessary implication pursuant to G.L. c. 41 \u00a7 98F which expressly provides that entries on police logs concerning arrests of a person under the age of 18 shall be kept separately, shall not be a public record nor shall such entry be disclosed to the public.\u00a0 See G.L. c. 41 ss.98F.\u00a0 While the record you are seeking is not an entry in the daily police log, it does relate to an arrest of a juvenile; therefore, by necessary implication, this information is not public and the Department redacted information relating to the juvenile. \r\nThe Department located body-worn camera videos from 1:34 AM to 2:26 AM, totaling 228 hours.\u00a0 However, the Department is denying your request pursuant to the investigatory exemption to the public records law because the records you seek are related to an ongoing open investigation, and their release at this time will prejudice effective law enforcement. \u00a0 A records custodian may withhold records concerning investigatory materials necessarily compiled out of public view by law enforcement officials where the disclosure of such materials would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that releasing the records is not in the public interest. See G. L.\u00a0 c.4,\u00a0 \u00a7 7(26) (f). \r\nThe Department recognizes that exemption (f) does not create a blanket exemption of all investigative materials created and maintained by police departments. See Dist. Attorney for the Norfolk Dist. v. Flatley, 419 Mass. 507, 512 (1995) ; WBZ-TV4 v. Dist. Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., 408 Mass. 595, 603 (1990) .\u00a0 Exemption (f) does not exempt all investigatory materials but rather requires a case-by-case analysis of whether disclosure would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that releasing the records is not in the public interest. See Reinstein v. Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, 378 Mass. 281, 289-90 (1979) . \r\nUnder the public records law, there is a presumption that the record sought is public, and the burden is on the custodian to prove with specificity how the exemption applies.\u00a0 G. L.\u00a0 c. 66\u00a0 \u00a710 (c).\u00a0 Records custodians may withhold records relating to an ongoing investigation if the release of such records would disclose confidential investigative techniques, procedures or sources of information. See Bougas v. Chief of Police of Lexington, 371 Mass. 59, 354 N.E.2d 872 (1976) .\u00a0 An essential part of the investigatory process includes a dialogue between police departments, individual citizens, and potential witnesses.\u00a0 Exemption (f) contemplates that individual citizens should be encouraged to come forward and speak freely with police concerning matters under investigation and the creation of initiative that police officers might be completely candid in recording their observations, hypotheses, and interim conclusions. Id . \r\nThe Department denies this portion of your request because the records are part of open Internal Affairs Department (IAD) investigations and criminal proceedings; disclosure will prejudice future law enforcement efforts for the reasons stated below.\u00a0 Disclosure of the requested records would interfere with enforcement proceedings.\u00a0 The body-worn camera videos are part of the investigation of this incident. Disclosure would prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that such disclosure is not in the public interest.\u00a0 Disclosure would prejudice effective law enforcement because officers and other prospective witnesses have not been interviewed. Disclosure would disclose confidential investigative techniques, procedures, or sources of information.\u00a0 Disclosure could inhibit the investigatory process by discouraging potential witnesses from coming forward or influencing witness statements. \u00a0 Encouraging citizens and prospective witnesses to come forward and speak with police and allowing the police department to establish trust with the community are essential elements of the investigatory process and effective law enforcement.\u00a0 Without this collaborative component, investigations will become more difficult.\u00a0 The collaboration between the public and the police and encouraging the public to cooperate with police investigations are reasons contemplated by the investigatory exemption.\u00a0 The investigatory process will be hampered if prospective witnesses do not come forward.\u00a0 Such a result will prejudice future law enforcement efforts and the possibility of effective law enforcement, which is not in the public interest.\u00a0 Further, releasing this record at this time may influence potential witnesses, thereby compromising the investigatory process.\u00a0 The Department is denying your request to protect the integrity of the investigative process and information relating to confidential investigative techniques, procedures, and sources and to maintain the ability to foster cooperation with the public.\u00a0 These records are part of an ongoing investigation, and their disclosure would prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement; therefore, disclosure of the requested record is not in the public interest.\u00a0 Disclosure of this record would also have a chilling effect on future law enforcement efforts. \r\nA records custodian is obligated to provide segregable portions of records where possible. See Globe Newspaper Co. v. Exec. Office of Admin. and Fin. , Suffolk Sup. No. 11-01184- A (June 14, 2013).\u00a0 However, providing segregable portions of the requested records is impossible without revealing confidential investigative techniques, procedures, or sources of information . Withholding this record is necessary to prevent interference with enforcement proceedings.\u00a0 The disclosure would prejudice effective law enforcement and not be in the public interest. Once the IAD and criminal investigations are concluded, the Department may reevaluate its position if you wish to make another public records request. \r\nYou may appeal this response to the Supervisor of Records in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10A (c); G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(b)(ix); 950 CMR 32.08; 950 CMR 32.08(1)(h) (in petitioning the Supervisor, the requester shall provide a copy of such petition to the records access officer associated with such petition). You may also appeal to the Superior Court. 950 CMR 32.06(3)(c). Yours truly, Christine O'Donnell Assistant Corporation Counsel Office of the Legal Advisor Boston Police Department",

Buffalo Enterprise Development Corp., 601 N.Y.S.2d 480 (N.Y. App. Div. 1993) affirms the public's right to access records related to government contracts and expenditures.\r\n\r\nPolicies, Guidelines, and Procedures: All documents regarding conflicts of interest for public officials, particularly with regard to dual employment.\r\n\r\nLegal support: Capital Newspapers v.

Four-hundred twenty-four responsive emails are redacted to omit personally identifiable information for specifically identified persons, including names, date of birth, Social Security Numbers, home addresses, and phone numbers.\u00a0 Such portions are deemed intimate details of a highly personal nature.\u00a0 The public interest in disclosure does not outweigh the privacy interest these individuals hold.\u00a0 The information is not available from another public source. G. L.\u00a0 c.4,\u00a0 \u00a7 7(26) (c). Fifteen responsive email records consist of attorney-client privileged communications. Suffolk Const. Co., Inc. v. Division of Capital Asset Management , 449 Mass. 444 (2007). These records shall be withheld entirely.\u00a0 A records custodian must satisfy a three-part test in establishing the attorney-client privilege. See  Suffolk Constr. Co. v. Div. of Capital Asset Mgmt. , 449 Mass. 444 (2007); see also SPR18/423 Determination of the Supervisor of Records (April 11, 2018).\u00a0 The Suffolk Court\u2019s holding imposes a burden on a records custodian of \u201cnot only proving the existence of an attorney-client relationship but also (1) that the communications were received from a client during the client\u2019s search for legal advice from the attorney in his capacity as such; (2) that the communications were made in confidence; and (3) that the privilege as to these communications has not been waived.\u201d See SPR18/423 (April 11, 2018), p2.\u00a0 The withheld records consist solely of communications between City employees and their attorneys. Such records contain information between an attorney and client related to \u201cthe client\u2019s search for legal advice from the attorney in his capacity as such.\u201d All of these communications \u201cwere made in confidence.\u201d\u00a0 In all cases \u201cthe privilege as to these communications has not been waived.\u201d\u00a0 The Client is the City of Boston.

Records custodians may withhold records under the investigatory exemption relating to an ongoing investigation if the release of such records would disclose confidential investigative techniques, procedures, or sources of information. See G. L.\u00a0 c.4,\u00a0 \u00a7 7(26) (f); Bougas v. Chief of Police of Lexington, 371 Mass. 59, 354 N.E.2d 872 (1976) .\u00a0 An essential part of the investigatory process includes a dialogue between police departments, individual citizens, and potential witnesses.\u00a0 Exemption (f) contemplates that individual citizens should be encouraged to come forward and speak freely with police concerning matters under investigation and the creation of an initiative that police officers might be completely candid in recording their observations, hypotheses, and interim conclusions. Id Two incident reports have been uploaded.  There are redactions to these reports of under Exemption (a) of the Public Records Law in order to protect the identity of juveniles.\u00a0 Exemption\u00a0(a) applies to records that are specifically or by necessary implication exempted from disclosure by statute.\u00a0 G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a).\u00a0 \u00a0A government entity may use the statutory exemption as a basis for withholding requested materials where the exempting statute expressly states or necessarily implies that the public\u2019s right to inspect records under the Public Records Law is restricted.\u00a0\u00a0Att\u2019y Gen. v. Collector of Lynn, 377 Mass. 151, 154 (1979); Ottaway Newspapers, Inc. v. Appeals Court, 372 Mass. 539, 545-46 (1977).\u00a0 This exemption establishes two categories of exempted records.\u00a0 The first category consists of records that are expressly exempt from disclosure by statute where the language of the statute will provide that such record \"shall not be a public record\" or have similar language\u00a0referring to the confidentiality of the record.\u00a0 The second category under the exemption includes records deemed exempt under statute by necessary implication.\u00a0 G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(a). personally identifiable information for specifically identified persons, including date of birth, Social Security Numbers, home addresses, and phone numbers.\u00a0 Also, the name and identifying information of a juvenile are redacted \r\nThe Department redacted the name of the juvenile under the second category where records are exempted by necessary implication pursuant to G.L. c. 41 \u00a7 98F which expressly provides that entries on police logs concerning arrests of a person under the age of 18 shall be kept\u00a0separately, shall not be a public record nor shall such entry be disclosed to the public.\u00a0 See G.L. c. 41 ss.98F.\u00a0 While the record you are seeking is not an entry in the daily police log, it does relate to an arrest of a juvenile; therefore, by necessary implication, this information is not public and the Department redacted information relating to the juvenile. \r\nYou may appeal this response to the Supervisor of Records in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth.

L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(b)(ix); 950 CMR 32.08; 950 CMR 32.08(1)(h) (in petitioning the Supervisor, the requester shall provide a copy of such petition to the records access officer associated with such petition).

DSHS, 193 Wn. App. 377 (2016), holds that when a city receives a request for documents that includes a list of individuals, the City is required to determine whether the list will be used for \u201ccommercial purposes.\u201d The case concluded that a requestor has a commercial purpose if the requestor intends to use the list for direct or indirect profit-making activity, regardless of whether the requestor intends to contact the individuals on the list or even if the individuals are personally affected by the release of the list or not. If the City has some indication that a requester intends to use a list of individuals for a commercial purpose, we are required to \u201cinvestigate further\u201d before we disclose that list. \r\n\r\nFurther, the SEIU case held that even an affirmation stating that any responsive records received for a request which include lists of individuals will not be used for commercial purposes, is not sufficient.\u00a0 Instead, before we can release the records providing City salary information, we are required to obtain from you sufficient details as to what you intend to use the list for so that we can make an independent evaluation as to whether or not your purpose is commercial or not. \r\n\r\nPlease fill out and return the attached Commercial Purpose Declaration. A determination will then be made as to whether your stated purpose regarding the use of the list(s) of individuals contained in any compiled responsive records is sufficient to allow for the release of this information. To avoid unnecessary delay in obtaining these specific responsive records for your request, please return the completed declaration at your earliest opportunity. We will follow up with you within five business days as to the validity of the stated purpose relating to your request. \r\nPlease complete and return the Commercial Purpose Declaration within 30 days of today's date, or by February 8, 2024.\u00a0 If a completed declaration determined to be valid is not received in the City Clerk's Office by that date, your request will be considered concluded and closed, and a new request will be required in this matter after February 8. \r\nAs I advised above, we anticipate responsive records will be available on or about January 26, 2024, contingent upon the receipt of a completed declaration determined to be valid to show that records provided under this request containing lists of individuals will not be used for commercial purposes. \r\nSincerely, \r\nLaurie Farnsworth \r\nSpokane Deputy City Clerk",
