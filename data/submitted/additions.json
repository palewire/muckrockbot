This can also be provided by collated receipts for purchases by the agencies.\r\n\r\n-All 1122C: Usage Reports and purchase orders submitted by LEAs to the SPOC. According to the 1122 Program Guide, 1122C: Usage Reports and purchase orders are required to be sent to the SPOC within 30 days of purchase.\r\n\r\n-DLA Report: total expenditures to the Department of the Army which are reported annually and are releasable. The requested date range of the requested annual reports is 1994-2024.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKent Hoover, a citizen of Tennessee, in coordination with Lillian Mauldin.",
