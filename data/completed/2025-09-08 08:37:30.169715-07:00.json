        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function.\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request.\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed.  If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data.\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set)\r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes\r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations?\r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses.\r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations\r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request.\r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored.\r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\").\r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example:\r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps.\r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings.\r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements\r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems.\r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement\r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding:\r\n- Placement location recommendations\r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement\r\n- Community concerns or opposition\r\n- Equity or privacy impacts\r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale\r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion.\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail)\r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.  Please include:\r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.\r\n- Date and time of access\r\n- Name and Job Title of User\r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query)\r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged\r\n2. Network Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests.\r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1.\r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to:\r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement\r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors\r\n- Surveillance technology policy\r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOmar Solis",

        "communication": "Dear Omar Solis: The Hayward Police Department received a request for police records from you on 6/8/2025. Your request mentioned: \r\n\"To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function.\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request.\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data.\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set)\r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes\r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations?\r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses.\r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations\r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request.\r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored.\r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\").\r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example:\r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps.\r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings.\r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements\r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025.\r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025.\r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems.\r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement\r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding:\r\n- Placement location recommendations\r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement\r\n- Community concerns or opposition\r\n- Equity or privacy impacts\r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale\r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion.\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail)\r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. Please include:\r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.\r\n- Date and time of access\r\n- Name and Job Title of User\r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query)\r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged\r\n2. Network Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests.\r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1.\r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to:\r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement\r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors\r\n- Surveillance technology policy\r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOmar Solis\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhayward-police-department-5650%252Fautomated-license-plate-reader-alpr-records-request-hayward-police-department-187607%252F%253Femail%253DLeah.Mendes%252540hayward-ca.gov&url_auth_token=AAAa3kcL3Wrbd9x3rteHtE-_Gc0%3A1uOTEa%3An5muBVlzWFGtN4emHE78bal4vmdR0uvLyRG2iR5IRBA\" Your request has been referred to the appropriate HPD staff for follow-up, and we will provide you with an email response by June 20, 2025.

Your request mentioned: \r\n\"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025. \r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. \r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request. \r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025. \r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025. \r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data. \r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software. \r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act \r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist. \r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought. \r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set) \r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes \r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations? \r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses. \r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations \r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request. \r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored. \r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\"). \r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example: \r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps. \r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings. \r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements \r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems. \r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement \r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding: \r\n- Placement location recommendations \r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement \r\n- Community concerns or opposition \r\n- Equity or privacy impacts \r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale \r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion. \r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail) \r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. Please include: \r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency. \r\n- Date and time of access \r\n- Name and Job Title of User \r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query) \r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged \r\n2. Network Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System. \r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests. \r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1. \r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to: \r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement \r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors \r\n- Surveillance technology policy \r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nOmar Solis \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhayward-police-department-5650%252Fautomated-license-plate-reader-alpr-records-request-hayward-police-department-187607%252F%253Femail%253DLeah.Mendes%252540hayward-ca.gov&url_auth_token=AAAa3kcL3Wrbd9x3rteHtE-_Gc0%3A1uOTEa%3An5muBVlzWFGtN4emHE78bal4vmdR0uvLyRG2iR5IRBA\" The City will need additional time to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded.

Your request mentioned: \r\n\u201cTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025. \r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. \r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request. \r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025. \r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025. \r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data. \r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software. \r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act \r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist. \r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought. \r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set) \r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes \r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations? \r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses. \r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations \r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request. \r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored. \r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\"). \r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example: \r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps. \r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings. \r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements \r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems. \r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement \r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding: \r\n- Placement location recommendations \r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement \r\n- Community concerns or opposition \r\n- Equity or privacy impacts \r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale \r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion. \r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail) \r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. Please include: \r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency. \r\n- Date and time of access \r\n- Name and Job Title of User \r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query) \r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged \r\n2. Network Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System. \r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests. \r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1. \r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to: \r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement \r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors \r\n- Surveillance technology policy \r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nOmar Solis \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhayward-police-department-5650%252Fautomated-license-plate-reader-alpr-records-request-hayward-police-department-187607%252F%253Femail%253DLeah.Mendes%252540hayward-ca.gov&url_auth_token=AAAa3kcL3Wrbd9x3rteHtE-_Gc0%3A1uOTEa%3An5muBVlzWFGtN4emHE78bal4vmdR0uvLyRG2iR5IRBA\u201d \r\nThe Hayward Police Department has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request. Please log in to the Public Records Portal at the following link to retrieve the appropriate responsive documents. \r\nPolice Department - Public Records Request - P000279-060825 \r\n\r\nPlease note: You will have 60 days and/or 5 downloads to save and print your responsive records before they are no longer available through this request. \r\nSome of the information requested is exempt from release under the California Public Records Act (CPRA). See Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1798.90.5 et. seq (S.B. 34); Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1798.90.55(b); Gov. Code, \u00a7 7923.600, subd. (a). The information is also exempt from release since the public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure as revealing the location of ALPR cameras would interfere with law enforcement\u2019s ability to enforce against criminality and public nuisances. Gov. Code, \u00a7 7922.000 \r\nAdditionally, to the extent records responsive to your request include privileged material (attorney-client and deliberative process privileges, that confidential information has been redacted and will not be released. Gov. Code, \u00a7 7927.70; Fairley v. Superior Court 66 Cal.App.4th 1414, 1420\u20131422; Costco Wholesale Corporation v. Superior Court (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 733; Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company v. Superior Court (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1272\u20131275; Clark v. Superior Court (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 37, 49\u201352; Evid. Code \u00a71040. Disclosure of certain pre-decisional communications between staff are also confidential and exempt from released on the CPRA, since disclosure of such materials would expose the City\u2019s decision-making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the City, thereby undermining the City\u2019s ability to perform its own functions. Times Mirror Company v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1338; Gov. Code, \u00a7 7922.000; Evid. Code \u00a71040. \r\nWithout waiving the above objections and exemptions, the City is nonetheless releasing records responsive to this request. Due to the overlybroad nature of the request and the number and volume of potentially responsive records, the City is still reviewing potentially responsive records and will provide all non-exempt records on a rolling basis as soon as they are available. \r\nIf you have any questions, or wish to discuss this further, please contact the Public Records Desk at 510-293-7014. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\nHAYWARD POLICE DEPARTMENT \r\n\r\nGiuliana Garibay-Ore \r\nRecords Clerk \r\n\r\nThis is an auto-generated email and has originated from an unmonitored email account.

Your request mentioned: \r\n\u201cTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025. \r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. \r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request. \r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025. \r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025. \r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data. \r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software. \r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act \r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist. \r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought. \r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set) \r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes \r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations? \r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses. \r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations \r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request. \r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored. \r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\"). \r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example: \r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps. \r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings. \r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements \r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems. \r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement \r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding: \r\n- Placement location recommendations \r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement \r\n- Community concerns or opposition \r\n- Equity or privacy impacts \r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale \r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion. \r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail) \r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. Please include: \r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency. \r\n- Date and time of access \r\n- Name and Job Title of User \r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query) \r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged \r\n2. Network Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System. \r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests. \r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1. \r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to: \r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement \r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors \r\n- Surveillance technology policy \r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nOmar Solis \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhayward-police-department-5650%252Fautomated-license-plate-reader-alpr-records-request-hayward-police-department-187607%252F%253Femail%253DLeah.Mendes%252540hayward-ca.gov&url_auth_token=AAAa3kcL3Wrbd9x3rteHtE-_Gc0%3A1uOTEa%3An5muBVlzWFGtN4emHE78bal4vmdR0uvLyRG2iR5IRBA\u201d \r\nWithout waiving the previous asserted objections and exemptions the City of Hayward is releasing additional non-exempt records responsive to your request.\u00a0 The City will continue to release non-exempt responsive records on a rolling basis as soon as the records are available for release.

Your request mentioned: \r\n\"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025. \r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. \r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request. \r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025. \r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025. \r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data. \r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software. \r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act \r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist. \r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought. \r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set) \r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes \r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations? \r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses. \r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations \r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request. \r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored. \r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\"). \r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example: \r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps. \r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings. \r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements \r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems. \r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement \r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding: \r\n- Placement location recommendations \r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement \r\n- Community concerns or opposition \r\n- Equity or privacy impacts \r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale \r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion. \r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail) \r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. Please include: \r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency. \r\n- Date and time of access \r\n- Name and Job Title of User \r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query) \r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged \r\n2. Network Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System. \r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests. \r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1. \r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to: \r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement \r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors \r\n- Surveillance technology policy \r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nOmar Solis \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhayward-police-department-5650%252Fautomated-license-plate-reader-alpr-records-request-hayward-police-department-187607%252F%253Femail%253DLeah.Mendes%252540hayward-ca.gov&url_auth_token=AAAa3kcL3Wrbd9x3rteHtE-_Gc0%3A1uOTEa%3An5muBVlzWFGtN4emHE78bal4vmdR0uvLyRG2iR5IRBA\" \r\nThe Hayward Police Department has identified records that are responsive to your request.

You are seeking records pertaining to show the total number of deportations, removals, and returns carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement between April 1, 2025 and August 15, 2025. \n\nThese documents are on the https://www.ice.gov/foia/library and search for 2025-ICLI-00019 \nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.

This request does not dispute that point. Instead, it seeks to determine whether COOG has adopted any policy\u2014formal or informal\u2014concerning whether staff may transmit neutral, fact-only complaints or notices when they encounter such conduct in FOIL appeals and determinations that agencies are required by law to forward to COOG (\u00a7 89(4)(a)).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this request is to ensure transparency: either to confirm that no such policy exists (meaning COOG has discretion but chooses not to act), or to identify any written guidance that explains why complaint-forwarding is prohibited. In either case, the public has an interest in understanding how systemic FOIL violations are handled when they rise to the level of potential criminal conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords sought (Jan. 1, 2020\u2013present):\r\n\r\nA. Any written policy, SOP, memo, training slide, or email guidance adopted or used by COOG that addresses whether COOG staff may (or may not) transmit complaints, notices, or factual summaries to\r\n\r\n(i) the State Inspector General\r\n(ii) county district attorneys\r\n(iii) the Office of the State Comptroller Investigations\r\n or (iv) the Attorney General Public Integrity Bureau\r\n\r\nconcerning potential willful concealment or destruction of FOIL\u2011responsive records.\r\n\r\nB. Any records reflecting instances in which COOG transmitted (or declined to transmit) such complaints/notices to any of the authorities in A.\r\n\r\nC. Any legal analysis produced for or held by COOG that interprets FOIL \u00a7\u00a7 89(1)(b), 89(2)(a), 89(4)(a) and/or Penal Law \u00a7 240.65 in relation to COOG\u2019s ability to forward factual materials to enforcement authorities.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

Itemized expenditures are requested for the amount allocated and line-item expenditures to each club and student organization and what was budgeted for each for the selected academic years what will enable analysis of allocated to expended and within expenditures identify what products or services were procured. These should include the portion of these fees allocated for cadet activities consisting of facilities maintenance, debt service, cadet counseling services, cadet organizations and any other expenditures from this fund by office or organization that expended the funds, by supply or service purchased. Itemized expenditures by category and organization should total the amount reported as collected from Cadets and other identified sources. This information should be readily available in any reasonable standard accounting system using acceptable accounting practices and so should not require a significant level of efforts to identify and provide those records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Thank you for your response. Understand you are very busy, and I appreciate you providing this information and the other responses. I also understand you are not required to create records.\r\n\r\nI may need some help clarifying what I should ask for, as the request I submitted was a standard one sent to multiple schools, so I could create an \"apples to apples\" comparison.\r\n\r\nI reviewed the summary of fees that you sent the link for, and it was very helpful. Can you advise me on what records are available to locate the information needed for my comparison?\r\n\r\nThe objective is to determine the breakdown of what is included in each of the fee categories so it may not need the level of detail I requested in my original FOIA.\r\n\r\n1. Several schools charge students an \"athletic fee,\" and all of that income goes to NCAA sports. Does Citadel have an equivalent to this and, if so, how much is it per student?\r\n2. Is there a breakdown of what specific services or activities the \"Leadership Lab\" fee covers?\r\n3. Several schools charge a \"Student Activity Fee\". For example, VMI Charges a \"Cadet Facilities/Activities Fee\"\r\n4. Is there a breakdown of the Quartermaster fee? For example, VMI's Quarter Master fee includes Haircuts, Laundry, Uniforms/UMA Activities. I found Laundry, but is there a breakdown of what that included?\r\n5. Again using VMI as the example, For Academic Year 2024-2025, VMI charged all cadets a comprehensive auxiliary fee totaling $7,182. The portion of this fee allocated for cadet facilities/activities totals $2,526 and includes funding for facilities maintenance, debt service, cadet counseling services, and various cadet organizations. There is a list of cadet organizations receiving an operating budget of $100 or more from this fee. The funding for these organizations totals $487,000 and represents approximately $312 of the auxiliary fee paid by cadets based on a budgeted yearly average student enrollment of 1,559 cadets. Does Citadel have a similar breakdown, ESPECIALLY for what Student activities like Clubs?\r\n\r\nGiven the differences between senior military colleges in these areas, we want to be sure our comparative analysis is accurate and as much of an \"apples to apples\" as we can.\r\n\r\nFinally, rather than put you through the trouble of FOIAs, when we have our analysis done for the Citadel, is there someone we can send it to to be sure it is accurate!",

You are seeking the following: \"To Whom It May Concern:Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:please provide a detailed list of all expenditures made under the Biden administration via micro purchasing and simplified acquisition. Preferably in excel and include all the companies that received these funds contact info including email.The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please see the EPA Organization Chart here: https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/epa-organization-chart. It is unclear whether you are requesting expenditures from a Regional Office such as Region 4 in Georgia or other program(s). \r\n\r\nAre you able to narrow your request to a specific office or offices from which you are seeking records? \r\n\r\nAdditionally, if there is a specific way you are defining \"all expenditures\", please advise to help narrow the scope of the search. \r\n\r\nEPA\u2019s FOIA regulations state: \u201cWhenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter. If known, the requester should include any file designations or descriptions for the records that the requester wants. The more specific the requester is about the records or type of records that the requester wants, the more likely EPA will be able to identify and locate records responsive to the request.\u201d 40 C.F.R 2.102 (c) The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, . or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify reasonably described records \r\n\r\nWe would like to provide you with the opportunity to clarify the records that you are seeking so that EPA can process your request. \u00a0As indicated in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.102(c), please include any specific information about the records, including time period, authors, or a more detailed description of the records' subject matter.\u00a0 Please contact Lee Hagy at hagy.lee@epa.gov with your clarification or let us know if youwould like to schedule a time to discuss your request over the phone. \r\n.\u00a0\u00a0If we do not hear back from you, EPA may issue a final determination to close out your request. Please note that you are not prohibited from submitting additional Freedom of Information Act requests in the future. Please reply within 20 calendar days from the date of this email by Tuesday, December 17, 2024 \r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit our website at: https://www.epa.gov/foia.

        "communication": "FDA FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of the Executive Secretariat\r\nUS Food Administration\r\n5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1050\r\n\r\nRe: APPEAL - Freedom of Information Act\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal under the Freedom of Information Act regarding FDA FOIA Control #: 2022-98.\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 28, 2021, I requested records under the Freedom of Information Act from the FDA pertaining to \"All emails that include and/or contain the word 'embargo' that were sent to, from, and/or between specific email addresses between the dates of 3/1/2020 and the date this request is ultimately processed, including their attachments.\" I also provided a specific list of email addresses belonging to officials at the FDA.\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 29, 2021, I received confirmation from the FDA that my request had been received and was provided with reference number FDA2179960.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 4, 2022, I received an acknowledgement letter from director Sarah Kotler letting me know that the agency would respond to my request with a determination and let me know about fees, and informing me that the agency needed an extra 10 days to respond.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 5, 2022, Sarah Kotler contacted me asking to speak with me by phone about my request.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 6, 2022, I called the number Ms. Kotler had provided to me but was unable to reach her.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 7, 2022, I finally spoke with Ms. Kotler by phone. She recommended that I narrow my search parameters down to the following to speed up the process of retrieving the requested information: \"All emails that include and/or contain the word 'embargo' that were sent to, from, and/or between the following email addresses between the dates of 3/1/2020 and the date this request is ultimately processed: heidi.Rebello@fda.hhs.gov ; michael.felberbaum@fda.hhs.gov.\" \r\n\r\nI agreed to Ms. Kotler's recommendation to narrow the request to the above parameters by phone, and then sent a follow-up email immediately following our conversation confirming the same.\r\n\r\nAfter my phone conversation with Ms. Kotler, my email address was suddenly classified as spam by the FDA. Because of that, my follow-up emails would not go through to Ms. Kotler. Instead, a traditional letter was sent by mail, which Ms. Kotler confirmed receipt of in an email sent to me on 1/25/2022.\r\n\r\nIt is now June 28, 2022 and I still have not received a determination letter for my request. I assume the request was approved, because Ms. Kotler sent an email response to my follow-up questions on 3/28/2022 and 4/27/2022 letting me know the agency was preparing a significant volume of records. However, I was never provided with a determination letter letting me know whether my request was approved or denied, or informing me of my fee status as a media requester.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am aware, the FDA is required by the FOIA to provide me with a determination about my request status and my fee status within 30 days of my request, both of which I still have not received over six months later.\r\n\r\nI have attached copies of the only two letters I've received from Ms. Kotler regarding FDA FOIA Control #: 2022-98.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions while handling this appeal, you can contact me at the email address listed below. I would prefer that all communications related to this appeal be in writing if possible, so I am not providing a phone number.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Miller\r\n122415-50044888@requests.muckrock.com\r\nMuckRock News DEPT MR 122415 411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville MA 02144-2516 US",

I am still very interested in receiving the records I requested from your agency via that FOIA request.\r\n\r\nAs far as your question asking for \"a topic\" related to the records I am seeking, please refer to this article in Scientific American: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-fda-manipulates-the-media\r\n\r\nAs far as your question about specific keywords to search for, please follow the instructions in my original request and simply search for the term \"embargo.\" You may also include \"embargoes\" and \"embargoed,\" in addition to \"embargo,\" if you think it might turn up additional records (although, presumably, a search for \"embargo\" should automatically include those additional terms).\r\n\r\nFinally, as a reminder, I submitted this FOIA request to your agency on Dec. 28, 2021. It is now January 25, 2025. In over four years, your agency still has not provided me with the responsive records for this request. \r\n\r\nGiven the extraordinary amount of time that has lapsed between the submission of my FOIA request and today's date, I believe it is appropriate to remind your agency of its duty to transparency under the FOIA, including your duty to make public records \"promptly available\" to requesters after a determination has been issued by your agency (which typically occurs within 20 days of the initial request, per  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)).\r\n\r\nOn 2/24/2022, Sarah B. Kotler emailed me about this request, stating: \"The assigned office is currently searching for responsive records.\" On 3/28/2022, Sarah B. Kotler followed up again, stating: \"We are in the process of collecting records for this request.\" \r\n\r\nIt has been almost three years since Ms. Kotler emailed me those updates about my FOIA request.\r\n\r\nPer  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(i), agencies must provide requested records \"promptly\" after issuing a determination: \"Any person making a request to any agency for records under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to such request if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions of this paragraph. If the Government can show exceptional circumstances exist and that the agency is exercising due diligence in responding to the request, the court may retain jurisdiction and allow the agency additional time to complete its review of the records. Upon any determination by an agency to comply with a request for records, the records shall be made promptly available to such person making such request. Any notification of denial of any request for records under this subsection shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial of such request.\"\r\n\r\nEven in cases of supposed \"extraordinary circumstances,\" the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit Court has already addressed the problem of unusually long delays in making public records available to requesters. In Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 711 F.3d 180, 188 (D.C. Cir. 2013), the Court stated: \r\n\r\n\"Second, the statute requires that the agency immediately notify the requester of the right 'to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination.- Id. The requirement that the agency notify the requester about administrative appeal rights further indicates that the \u201cdetermination\u201d must be substantive, not just a statement of a future intent to produce non-exempt responsive documents. Otherwise, this right of administrative appeal would make little sense because there would be nothing to appeal at the time the agency makes its supposed 'determination' in response to a properly filed FOIA request.\r\n\r\n\"This critical point both highlights and unravels the maneuver that the FEC (backed by the Department of Justice) is attempting here. Under the FEC's theory, an agency could respond to a request within 20 working days in terms not susceptible to immediate administrative appeal\u2014by simply stating, in essence, that it will produce documents and claim exemptions over withheld documents in the future. Then, the agency could process the request at its leisure, free from any timelines. All the while, the agency's actions would remain immune from suit because the requester would not yet have been able to appeal and exhaust administrative appeal remedies. Therein lies the Catch\u201322 that the agency seeks to jam into FOIA: A requester cannot appeal within the agency because the agency has not provided the necessary information. Yet the requester cannot go to court because the requester has not appealed within the agency. Although the agency may desire to keep FOIA requests bottled up in limbo for months or years on end, the statute simply does not countenance such a system, as we read the statutory text.\" (Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 711 F.3d 180, 186-87 (D.C. Cir. 2013))\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind the laws and court rulings cited above, it is unacceptable that I have waited over four years to receive the requested records under this FOIA request.\r\n\r\nThat said, please be aware that if I have not received all of the requested records pertaining to this request by 1/31/2025, I will have no choice but to seek dispute resolution from the OGIS, per my rights as a requester under the federal FOIA. Should that happen, considering the amount of time that has lapsed between my original request, and the fact that there is a six-year statute of limitations for filing FOIA lawsuits against the federal government, there is also a strong chance that I will begin to seek legal counsel regarding this request at the same time.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me in writing at this email address if you have any further questions. I do not wish to be contacted by phone, as I am now requesting that all further communications be in writing moving forward, so that I may have legal documentation to provide to OGIS and possibly an attorney.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Marie Miller",

Humphrey Building, Room 729H\r\n200 Independence Avenue, SW\r\nWashington, D.C. 20201\r\n\r\nAPPEAL: FOIA Request - FDA FOIA Control #2022-98\r\n\r\nMarch 12, 2025\r\n\r\nDear Paula Formoso,\r\n\r\nI am writing to submit an appeal for a FOIA request that I submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 8, 2021, which sought records of emails containing the word \u201cembargo\u201d that were sent to, from, and/or between a set of specific email addresses belonging to specific officials at FDA and HHS between the dates of March 1, 2020, and the date the FOIA request was ultimately processed. \r\n\r\nMy request (FDA FOIA Control #2022-98) was acknowledged by Sarah B. Kotler, Director of the FDA Division of Freedom of Information, on January 4, 2022. Part of the responsive records related to my request were apparently referred to HHS for review in December 2023, but were never provided to me.\r\n\r\nYou can review my original request and my communications with the FDA\u2019s FOIA office staff about this request on the MuckRock website (an online FOIA requester service and public database through which my request was filed), where you can also review scans of the FDA\u2019s acknowledgement letters and the partial records related to my request: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/emails-mentioning-embargo-2020-2021-fda-office-of-media-affairs-122415/ \r\n\r\nTo my knowledge, none of the acknowledgement letters I received related to this FOIA request provided a deadline for appeal. To date, the request has not been completed by HHS or FDA, and because of HHS and FDA\u2019s unusually long delays in providing the requested records, I am appealing both agencies' responses to this request, which I believe violate the FOIA in spirit and letter.\r\n\r\nOn December 28, 2023 (over a year after my request was submitted), I received a small batch of records related to my request. In an email to me on the same date, Ms. Kotler explained the partial delivery of records and informed me that additional records would be released to me the following month (January 2024). Ms. Kotler also informed me in that email about other records related to my request that had been referred to HHS and told me those records would be made available to me after review by your agency. You can view Ms. Kotler\u2019s email at the MuckRock link above, under the \u201cCommunications\u201d tab.\r\n\r\nAs of today\u2019s date, March 12, 2025, I have not received any more documents related to my FOIA request beyond the partial delivery in December 2023, described above, despite Sarah Kotler\u2019s assurances that more records would be provided to me.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear to me whether the remainder of my request will ever be completed, as it has been over three years since I originally submitted this request to the FDA, and it has been over a year since the agency last produced a small portion of the requested records and referred additional records to HHS for review. As a result of the unusually lengthy delay in the production of the requested records by both agencies, I am submitting this appeal to both agencies' public liaisons for review.\r\n\r\nPer 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(i), agencies must provide requested records \"promptly\" after issuing a determination: \"Any person making a request to any agency for records under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to such request if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions of this paragraph.

(\"CPRA\u201d), and all other applicable laws, please disclose the following records.\r\n\r\nAny and all autopsy, death investigation, and coroner\u2019s reports relating to the death of:\r\n\r\nName: Jose Soliz, Date of birth: 03-25-1993, Date of death: 11-26-2022\r\n\r\nIf records pursuant to this request are possessed in machine-readable format such as an .xls, .csv spreadsheet file, please provide the record in this format. Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much, \r\n\r\nDillon Bergin",

Incident reports and case records refer to reports produced with notes and narratives, a description of what happened by the responding officer, trace reports, case notes and litigation files\r\n- All unedited body-worn camera / bodycam recordings. I am specifically requesting the unedited body-worn camera recordings captured by all officers present for the full duration of the incident, including audio recordings associated with the footage. If any portion of the requested footage must be redacted, I ask that you clearly indicate the portions that have been redacted and provide an explanation of the legal basis for the redactions\r\n- All 911 or calls for service logs, audio and transcripts\r\n- All computer aided dispatch (CAD) reports and a copy of your department\u2019s dispatch 10 signals/codes, agency dispatch signals/codes and CAD signals/codes\r\n\r\nI request these records in their native digital formats and not in formats that degrade the accessibility of the records, such as tabular data converted to PDF or Word files. If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files). Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, I additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nProduction of Responsive Records on a Rolling Basis: In the event that a portion of the present request is completed before the full request is completed, I ask that the records be produced on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nRequest for Explanation of Withholdings and Redactions: If this request is denied in whole or in part, please provide a reasonable description of any withheld materials and a justification for all such withholdings that includes reference to the specific  exemptions authorizing withholding and specific reasons why such exemptions apply. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDillon Bergin",

Except for any \u201clists, spreadsheets, or other organized datasets\u201d referenced in your request, the records you are seeking originate from the Kittitas County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office and are provided to our office as part of discovery in cases where we represent defendants. Our office does not create or maintain \u201clists, spreadsheets, or other organized datasets\u201d containing the requested information. \r\nDiscovery is governed by CrR 4.7(h)(3) and (7), which prohibit defense counsel from disseminating discovery materials and authorize sanctions for violations of these rules. In addition, the Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically RPC 1.6, strictly prohibit attorneys from disclosing any information related to the representation of a client, regardless of its source.

If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.

Records of the most recent inventory of rifles possessed by the Sheriff's Office, as defined in Sections 30510 and 30515 of the Penal Code (assault rifles, patrol rifles, sniper rifles, .50 caliber rifles).\r\n2. Records indicating the number of rifles, as defined in Sections 30510 and 30515 of the Penal Code,  privately possessed by personnel of the Sheriff's Office with its authorization, OR the number of Sheriff's Office personnel with such authorization.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, I ask that you make records available to me as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n \r\nThe requested documents or information from them will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the American Friends Service Committee California Healing Justice Program at jlindsay-poland@afsc.org or by phone at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I received the initial data in excel but have discovered after review has begun that Fried B contains student identifiable information that must be redacted. This data is scattered intermittently in the field and is much more efficiently redacted in adobe. Therefore I have converted the records to adobe for redaction. \r\n  \r\n Field A however is the class title, which appears to be more what you are looking for. We do not keep these records by university college as you have requested. They will not be provided that way. \r\n  \r\n I have two alternatives for you: \r\n  \r\n Alt 1: Get in excel Field A (only) which is the \"count\" and class abbreviation for each count of academic dishonesty reported to the Dean of Students office. \r\n  \r\n Alt 2: Get Fields A and B in adobe so they can be redacted in accordance with the requirements of federal law. We simply do not have the staff capital to redact in excel which takes at least twice as long as redaction in adobe when we currently have 120 other requesters waiting for records. \r\n  \r\n Please reply by 8.28.25 with you alternative choice. Obviously Alt 1 will be a quick turnaround after that, Alt will take longer. \r\n  \r\n Of you do not reply by August 28th, I will take silence as acceptance of Alt 1 and will reply with that material. You may always make a new request. \r\n  \r\n Thank you, \r\n  \r\n Julie Laundrie \r\n Public Records Custodian \r\n Office of Compliance \r\n University of Wisconsin-Madison \r\n  \r\n University of Wisconsin-Madison \r\n 500 Lincoln Drive\r\n361 Bascom Hall\r\nMadison, Wisconsin 53706 \r\n (608) 265-6018",
