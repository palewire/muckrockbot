Specifically, I am requesting any documents related to Mr. Turner's activities, communications, or associations that were collected, created, or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\nTo provide context, Hal Turner is a political commentator and radio host who has been involved in controversial and potentially illegal activities, including making threatening and harassing statements directed at public officials and journalists. He has also been linked to extremist and white supremacist groups.\r\n\r\nIn making this request, I cite the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and request a prompt response to this request, as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i).\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to cite the following case law:\r\n\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation v. Department of Justice, 739 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2014): This case established that the FBI's Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) indices are subject to FOIA disclosure, and that requesters may seek a full integrity search of these indices using specific key strings related to the subject of the request.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a full search of all FBI records systems, including ELSUR indices, for any records related to Hal Turner that fall within the scope of this request. Specifically, I request records related to:\r\n\r\nCommunications, meetings, or other interactions between Mr. Turner and FBI personnel or informants.\r\nAny investigations or surveillance activities related to Mr. Turner's activities, communications, or associations.\r\nAny records related to extremist or white supremacist groups with which Mr. Turner has been associated.\r\nTo facilitate the search, I request that the following key string be used: \"Hal Turner.\"\r\n\r\nI also remind you that any responsive records must be provided in their entirety and without redaction, unless a specific FOIA exemption applies. If any records are withheld, redacted, or deleted, I request a written explanation for the withholding that cites the specific FOIA exemption(s) relied upon.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",
