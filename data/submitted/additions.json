Nowicki, Ph.D., and published in The Wall Street Journal, Wednesday, May 16, 2001, page A-23, Mr. Nowicki refers to tapes he and a colleague recorded while aboard a US Navy EC121 while monitoring the events in the Eastern Mediterranean on June 8, 1967.\r\n\r\nWe are asking for a copy of the recordings referred to by Mr. Nowicki.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoe Meadors",
