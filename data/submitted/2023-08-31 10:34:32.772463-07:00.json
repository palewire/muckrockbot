Arsenidze was involved in the creation of the Democratic Republic of Georgia that existed briefly before Georgian became part of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nLater in life Arsendize wrote a memoir about Stalin titled, \"Iz vospominaniya o Staline\", which roughly translates as, \"From the Memory of Stalin.\" Of particular interest would be any agency records related to \"Iz vospominaniya o Staline\" - specifically an analysis of the book, it's translation into English, it's depiction of Stalin, and Soviet reaction to it. \r\n\r\nThe FOIA act provides that if portions of a document are exempt from release, the remainder must be segregated and disclosed. Therefore, I will expect you to send all nonexempt portions of the records which I have requested, and ask that you justify any deletions be referencing the specific provisions of the FOI act used to justify the deletions.  \r\n\r\nThank you for your commitment to transparency, and I look forward to continue working on this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Hoskins:\r\n\r\nThis acknowledges receipt of your August 30 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) for records related to you.\r\n\r\nBecause you are requesting records related to you or another individual, further documentation is required before we can process your request.\r\n\r\nCertification of Identity (Necessary to release information located by searching by your name.):\r\n\r\nUnder postal regulations found at 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 265.3(d), \u201cFirst-party requests. A requester who is making a request for records about himself must provide verification of identity sufficient to satisfy the component as to his identity prior to release of the record. For Privacy Act-protected records, the requester must further comply with the procedures set forth in 39 CFR 266.6.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis regulation requires requesters to provide proof of their identity before an agency can begin processing their request. This ensures records containing the requester\u2019s name are not accidentally released to the wrong person.\r\n\r\nPlease complete and return the attached OIG Certification of Identity and Privacy Waiver along with a copy of a valid driver\u2019s license, employee identification, passport, or other identification clearly showing your face.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Waiver (Necessary to release information requested on behalf of a client or about any person other than yourself. This includes names, statements, or any other identifying information):\r\n\r\nUnder postal regulations found at 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 265.3(e), \u201cThird-party requests. Where a FOIA request seeks disclosure of records that pertain to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting a written authorization signed by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary).\u201d\r\n\r\nThis regulation requires requesters to provide written authorization from the subject of a record when requesting records about someone other than themself. This ensures records about that person are not accidentally released to the wrong person.\r\n\r\nPlease have your client, or the subject of the complaint/investigation, complete the attached OIG Certification of Identity and Privacy Waiver authorizing the OIG to release records to you. Please return the completed form along with a copy of a valid driver\u2019s license, employee identification, passport, or other identification clearly showing their face. If you are requesting records about more than one person, please have each person complete the form. This form can be photocopied, as necessary.\r\n\r\nNot completing the certification and proof of identity/privacy waiver process will limit our ability to release any responsive records we find in our files. They may be withheld in full or contain redactions made under FOIA Exemptions 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (b)(3), (b)(6), and(b)(7)(c).\r\n\r\nExemption (b)(3) provides agencies may withhold records exempted from disclosure by another statute that \u201cestablishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.\u201d  Under the Inspector General Act of 1978, an OIG is duty bound to protect information provided by agency employees during an investigation. Public Law 95\u2013452 5 U.S.C. app. 3 \u00a7 7(b).\r\n\r\nExemption (b)(6) pertains to information the release of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. The withheld material includes names, titles, and identifying information of private citizens. This information is not appropriate for discretionary disclosure.\r\n\r\nExemption (b)(7)(c) permits the withholding of records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which could constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. Lack\u00acing an individual's consent or an overriding public interest, third party investigatory records and/or allegations of misconduct must be withheld under Exemption (7)(c). This includes the names of, or identifying statements made by, any persons making allegations against the subject of an OIG investigation.\r\n\r\nWhen we receive the signed completed form(s) and appropriate proof of identity, we will search for records responsive to your request. Any responsive records located will be processed under established FOIA guidelines and a final determination will be issued.\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive the signed completed form and proof of identity, we will presume you are no longer interested in pursuing this request. You may file another request in the future when you are able to provide the required documentation. You may return the completed form via e-mail at foia@uspsoig.gov<mailto:foia@uspsoig.gov> or U.S. Mail at 1735 N. Lynn Street, Arlington, VA 22209.\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nUSPS OIG FOIA Team",

L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(a,:\r\n\r\nI am formally requesting records from the MA Dept of Public Utilities and Office of the Attorney General, and between the two agencies:\r\n\r\n - for any documentation of expert and/or public comment regarding health and safety concerns pertaining to 'smart meters' or \"advanced metering functionality,\" or \"AMI\" dating from January 2014 to present, including but not limited to any consultant fees paid directly or indirectly to Gradient and/or Peter Valberg; \r\n\r\n- and for information regarding the resolution of fraud complaints and cost overruns for the Worcester National Grid smart meter pilot program\r\n\r\nPlease note it is my understanding that rulings have stated that text messages count as public records as do emails sent on personal email accounts to conduct work-related business.\r\n\r\nBy way of background, in August of 2013, as reported by Go Local Worcester, \"In a stinging letter to the state Department of Public Utilities Commission, ( ), a lawyer from Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley\u2019s office pointed to large-scale tests in Illinois and elsewhere in which the meters failed to justify their costs. \u201cDespite these clear trends, [National Grid] proposes to launch a massive pilot at great ratepayer expense to test already tested hypotheses,\u201d Coakley\u2019s office wrote. The industry-friendly DPU last year brushed aside such concerns, and, in a 103-page order, approved Worcester's program. Jillian Fennimore, spokeswoman for Coakley\u2019s office, says, \u201cWe are currently monitoring the smart grid pilot program\u201d and will review the results of the final report that results. DPU referred questions about the Worcester program to National Grid.\" - http://www.golocalworcester.com/news/worcester-is-front-line-in-war-over-utilities-smart-meters/\r\n\r\nORDER 12-76 and Feb 2014 Panel Hearings:\r\n\r\nIn late February of 2014, the MA DPU held panel hearings regarding comments received in response to \"D.P.U. 12-76-A December 23, 2013, Investigation by the Department of Public Utilities on its own Motion into Modernization of the Electric Grid,\" issued by Chair Berwick. https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/9254075\r\n\r\nPeter Valberg of Gradient testified in person before the DPU for the panel hearings in Feb. 0f 2014, but no written testimony by Valberg was posted publicly.\r\n\r\nThe DPU received commentary and complaints from both health experts and from the public that the agency was relying on testimony, public relations, and marketing claims from a compromised, pro-industry, mercenary product defense expert, Peter Valberg of Gradient, who also works for the tobacco industry.\r\n\r\nORDER 12-76-B: June 2014\r\n\r\nFollowing the February hearings, on June 12 of 2014, the DPU issued order 12-76-B, https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/9241637 in which it discounted health concerns, referencing \"Gradient,\" and \"another commenter\" but not identifying Peter Valberg as the source.\r\n\r\nThe public record demonstrates that instead of consulting independent experts with health expertise and liability, the DPU promoted the opinion of Peter Valberg of Gradient Corporation, who did not file any written testimony. \r\nTherefore, the source of some claims included in MA 12-762-B discounting smart meter health and safety issues is unclear.\r\n\r\nThe MA DPU smart meter order 12-76-B made the unprecedented claim that exposure guidelines are adequate to protect against both thermal and non-thermal impacts of radio frequency exposure. The circumstances surrounding how that gross misrepresentation was incorporated in the MA DPU order, which then could be referenced in other proceedings, have not been addressed. https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/12907846\r\n\r\n2023 Pending Smart Meter Deployment by Investor-Owned Utilities:\r\n\r\nMA investor-owned utilities have been authorized by the MA DPU to deploy smart meters in their service territories. At the same time, health harm and disability has been reported in other jurisdictions where the meters were installed, including California, now extending for over a decade.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this FOIA request is:\r\n\r\n1. to determine whether or not the MA DPU and the Attorney General's office are basing health and safety justification for this investment decision by ratepayers on the 2014 testimony, or whether the DPU has revisited and/or monitored developments in RF/EMF research, including the court ruling requiring the FCC to justify why it has not revisited its 1996 exposure guidelines. Note that documented smart meter injuries were included in evidence submitted to the court. Testimony submitted to the DPU for https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/12907846 and https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/12639808 outlines this issue.\r\n\r\n2. to determine if potential smart meter vendors or utilities have disclosed the incidence of adverse health effects to the MA DPU or the AGO, including the acute onset of electrical sensitivity and/or if the MA DPU has accounted for the consequences to vulnerable ratepayers in its business case.\r\n\r\n3. to determine if the DPU's plan for utilities to offer an 'opt out' is based on accurate assumptions, and whether or not it will adequately protect all ratepayers\r\n\r\n4. to determine what correspondence/if any, took place between the AGO and the DPU regarding the safety of wireless smart utility meters and health, including complaints reported during the Worcester National Grid smart meter pilot program, financed by ratepayers.\r\n\r\n5. to determine whether or not the Attorney General was aware of or concurs with claims made in the 2014 order DPU 12-76-B, including the fraudulent implication that FCC limits are protective of non-thermal effects of RF exposures, or if the Attorney General's office concurs with the implication that the plan to deploy smart meters in MA protects the health and safety of all ratepayers. \r\n\r\nIf the AGO has not provided any advocacy for MA residents in response to health and safety concerns about smart meters during the Baker and Healey administrations and has no concerns about the impending deployment, please note that. \r\n\r\n\r\nI request that this FOIA correspondence be added to the public record for the MA dockets that refer to smart meters, time of use billing, grid modernization, and other relevant proceedings, including but not limited to MA DPU: 11-129, 13-83, 14-109, 15-21, 16-28, 17-53, 18-28, 20-69, 21-80, 20-81, and 21-82.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the DPU's mission statement notes that it seeks to promote safety, security, reliability of service, affordability, equity, and greenhouse gas emission reductions. https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-public-utilities\r\n\r\nRegarding the AGO, \"Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell\u2019s Office is an advocate and resource for the people of Massachusetts in many ways, including protecting consumers, combating fraud and corruption, investigating and prosecuting crime, and protecting the environment, workers, and civil rights.\"\r\n\r\nFees\r\n\r\nI request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and made in the process of news gathering, and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
