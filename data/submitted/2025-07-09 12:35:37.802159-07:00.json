A list of all video recordings concerning the Pentagon incident on 9/11, including:\r\n\u2022 The generalized location(s) from which video was collected.\r\n\u2022 The dates on which these videos were collected.\r\n\u2022 The formats and media types of the videos collected.\r\n\u2022 Any documentation or inventory lists identifying or describing the collected footage.\r\n\r\n2. A list or index of any videos related to this inquiry material that have not been released to the public from September 11, 2001 to the date of this request, including reasons for nondisclosure if applicable.\r\n\r\n3. Information on the current physical or digital storage location of all such videos related to this inquiry material, including where and how the footage is archived or maintained.\r\n\r\n4. Any communications, memoranda, or internal records that discuss or determine the release or withholding of any of this video footage from the public regarding this inquiry material.\r\n\r\nPlease include all responsive records regardless of their format or origin (e.g., internal records, communications with other government agencies, or third-party submissions).\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that multiple security cameras on the Pentagon property can be seen in various background video and images from 9/11/2001 that haven't been released to the public, such as:\r\n\u2022The south west corner of the heliport building there's a security camera clearly visible. A clear image by PH2 Jim Watson, USN titled \"A burned-out vehicle sits in the parking lot near the Pentagon building hours after the September 11, 2001 attack\"  clearly shows a security camera. \r\n\u2022Throughout the Pentagon structure you can see camera's that are on a candy cane type of mounts along with lighting fixtures near by on the roof of E-ring. At least 3 can be spotted that would be of interest as seen by photographs taken by: CPL Jason Ingersoll, Usmc,  TSGT Cedric H. Rudisill, USAF,  PH2 Jim Watson, USN\r\n\u2022 Parking Lot Security Cameras, if any. \r\n\r\nAlso, the Navy Annex building (known as Federal Office Building 2), controlled by the Dept. of the Navy until its demolition, was in direct line with Flight 77 flight path and there are security cameras throughout that complex, including the parking lot and rooftop corners that can be seen from pictures taken by  CPL Jason Ingersoll, Usmc on September 11, 2001 that may have captured AA Flight 77.\r\n\r\nThese camera views indicated above are noticeable as there may be more that aren't seen. The D.O.D. previously released 2 security videos that stemmed from the December 2004 Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
