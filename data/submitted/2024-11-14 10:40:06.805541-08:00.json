It further seeks records held by federal oversight agencies on related actions, communications, and decisions.\r\n\r\nPurpose of Request\r\nThis request seeks complete, unredacted records to establish evidence of:\r\n\r\nRetaliatory Actions: Impacts on ABI Resources, including Medicaid billing restrictions, program changes, and ticket closures.\r\nADA Non-Compliance: Documenting any failures by DSS, CMS, and associated entities in providing accessible communication for David Medeiros.\r\nFOIA Procedural Violations: Highlighting instances of partial responses and unsupported denials of relevant records.\r\nScope of Records Sought\r\nThe records requested cover December 1, 2023, to present. This scope includes, but is not limited to, emails, text messages, digital communications, internal memoranda, directives, meeting notes, attachments, drafts, and related working documents across all relevant departments, divisions, or offices.\r\n\r\n1. Medicaid Billing Suspension and Sandata EVV Ticket #539494 (CMS and DSS)\r\nComprehensive Communications and Directives: Full records (emails, memos, reports, directives, attachments, text messages) from DSS, CMS, and Sandata Technologies concerning Medicaid billing privileges for ABI Resources, LLC, including names and roles of those involved in discussions and approvals.\r\n\r\nComplete Documentation of Sandata EVV Ticket #539494: All records associated with Ticket #539494, including:\r\n\r\nInitial ticket details, problem descriptions, resolution requests, and follow-ups.\r\nCommunications detailing each stage of the ticket\u2019s handling, the reason for marking it \u201cresolved,\u201d and personnel involved in closing it.\r\n2.

Records on Program Changes Impacting ABI Resources (DSS, CMS)\r\nCompanion Authorizations Termination Records: All communications, policy documents, and assessments on the termination of companion authorizations for the ABI Waiver Program as of December 31, 2023, including any correspondence between DSS, CMS, and Sandata Technologies related to this decision.\r\n5. Documentation of Specific Individuals\u2019 Involvement (All Relevant Agencies)\r\nRecords Involving Named Personnel:\r\nAndrea Barton Reeves, Commissioner, DSS\r\nMatthew S. Antonetti, Legal Director, DSS\r\nAstread Ferron-Poole, DSS Associate\r\nMichelle A. James and Emmett Nicholson, CMS officials overseeing Medicaid compliance\r\nAll communications, directives, notes, meeting minutes, or any form of correspondence or records involving the above-named individuals with respect to ABI Resources, LLC, particularly regarding Medicaid billing restrictions, ADA accommodation requests, and actions following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for FOIA Request and Compliance Mandates\r\n1. FOIA Compliance (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA mandates timely responses, full disclosure of non-exempt records, and explicit justifications for any redactions or denials. Any failure by DSS, CMS, or other federal agencies to meet these statutory requirements will constitute non-compliance. All denials must include precise statutory citations under FOIA, and records must be provided in their entirety unless exemptions are clearly and legally justified.\r\n\r\n2. ADA Compliance Obligations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160)\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA, public entities must ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. This includes providing accessible documents in screen-reader-compatible formats and meeting specific requests for auxiliary aids. DSS and CMS\u2019s failure to meet these requests for ADA accommodations in communications constitutes non-compliance under federal ADA statutes.\r\n\r\n3. Federal Whistleblower Protection Standards\r\nWhistleblower protections prohibit retaliation against individuals who report agency misconduct. The actions taken against ABI Resources and David Medeiros, including billing suspension, premature ticket resolution, and operational disruptions following his whistleblower report, are viewed as retaliatory actions that must be substantiated and documented by all relevant agencies.\r\n\r\nSpecific Demands for Compliance\r\nTo ensure adherence to FOIA and ADA mandates, and to facilitate the transparency required by federal and state law, I formally request:\r\n\r\nDelivery of ADA-Compliant Records in Full:\r\n\r\nEmail-Only Communication via MuckRock Platform: All responses, updates, and records must be sent exclusively via email to eliminate accessibility barriers. CMS must refrain from using phone calls, physical mail, or portal-based responses.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body: Embed response text directly in the email body for immediate readability and accessibility.\r\nPDF Attachments for Documents: All records should be provided as clearly labeled PDF attachments, organized by date and document type, with original formatting preserved for clarity and navigability.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel: Each response must include names, titles, and contact information of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisory personnel responsible for processing my request, ensuring transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Justifications for Redactions and Denials: Any information withheld or redacted must include detailed explanations citing specific statutory exemptions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). These explanations must include enough detail to verify the legal basis for each exemption claimed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing of FOIA Request\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), I formally request expedited processing of this FOIA request. This demand is based on critical statutory factors, including significant public interest, imminent risks to the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for urgent transparency to prevent ongoing retaliatory actions by public agencies.\r\n\r\nFailure to grant expedited processing within the statutory 10-day review period will constitute non-compliance with FOIA\u2019s provisions, necessitating formal escalation of this request to administrative or legal authorities.\r\n\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to respond to this FOIA request in full compliance, or any delays without proper statutory explanation, may result in formal escalation through administrative, legal, or public channels. DSS, CMS, and other involved agencies are expected to adhere strictly to statutory timelines, ensuring transparency and adherence to ADA and FOIA standards. Non-compliance will be documented and pursued through all available legal remedies.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request seeks full and unambiguous access to records necessary to verify and substantiate claims of retaliation, ADA non-compliance, and procedural violations following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report. I expect each agency to adhere strictly to both FOIA and ADA standards, ensuring prompt and thorough disclosure of all relevant documentation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",
