This office received your request on February 8, 2026.  Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, the Department processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although DHS\u2019 goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). As your request seeks documents that will require a thorough and wide-ranging search, DHS will invoke a 10-day extension for your request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). If you would like to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters. As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher. We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. This office will contact you before accruing any further fees. We have queried the appropriate component(s) of DHS for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the analysts in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. Your request has been assigned reference number 2026-HQFO-01778. Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence.

Notice content and location\r\n\u2022\tThe specific notice(s), webpage(s), posting(s), or written materials the University relies on to \u201csummarize the provisions\u201d of ORS 659A.270\u2013659A.285, as required by ORS 659A.279;\r\n\u2022\tWhere those notices are posted or maintained, including physical locations and URLs;\r\n\u2022\tThe date each notice or posting went into effect and any revisions made since 2019.\r\n\r\n2. Procedures available to employees\r\n\u2022\tAny written procedures, guidance, or internal instructions explaining how an employee invokes the statutory protection with the University;\r\n\u2022\tIdentification of the office(s) responsible for administering the protection;\r\n\u2022\tPolicies or guidance explaining how the protection functions when Paid Leave Oregon benefits are unavailable, exhausted, or not applicable;\r\n\u2022\tAny materials intended to allow employees to plan around the protection, including timing, documentation, duration, and job-protection effects.\r\n\r\n3. Transition and change records (2019\u20132026)\r\n\u2022\tRecords documenting the transition from earlier certification forms and processes in use in or around 2019 to later versions used in 2026;\r\n\u2022\tAny drafts, approvals, internal communications, or decision-making records associated with revising or replacing those forms or procedures;\r\n\u2022\tRecords reflecting how the University evaluated whether revised forms, postings, or procedures continued to comply with ORS 659A.279 following the implementation of Paid Leave Oregon;\r\n\u2022\tAny records addressing how employees were notified of changes in forms, routing, or administration.\r\n\u2022\tAny written policies, procedures, workflows, routing instructions, or standard operating procedures used by Human Resources, HR Leaves, or other offices when an employee requests safety-related leave and Paid Leave Oregon benefits are unavailable or exhausted, including records addressing whether and how the employee is routed to University-administered unpaid leave or the 160-hour public-employer leave bank.\r\n\r\nIf the University contends that no responsive records exist for any portion of this request, please confirm that position in writing.\r\n\r\nClarification regarding parallel processes:\r\n\r\nTo avoid any confusion, this public records request is submitted pursuant to Oregon Public Records Law only and does not waive, replace, or otherwise affect any requests, grievances, or RFIs I have submitted through my union or any other employment-related process, many of which remain pending.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted because I require timely access to records necessary to understand my statutory protections and to plan accordingly. The public records process is the only mechanism currently available to obtain this information within a reasonable timeframe.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

A copy of the document is attached to this FOI request.\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirement: I am specifically requesting the metadata associated with this file, including but not limited to: Date of Creation, Date of Last Modification, Authoring User, and File Path.\r\n\r\n2.

FILING AND AUDIT TRAIL RECORDS All records, including emails, internal memos, or \"Records Disposal Authorizations\" (Form RC-075), that document the date this document was placed into the physical folder of the Health Department.\r\n\r\n5. All communications with the Connecticut Health Department in connection with the above referenced documents and Hat City Ale House from May 2018 to the present.\r\n\r\n6. All copies of the above referenced documents in possession of Sean Hearty, both as Permit Center Director/Coordinator and Zoning Enforcement Officer, Danbury Planning and zoning.\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirement: I am specifically requesting the metadata associated with these files, including but not limited to: Date of Creation, Date of Last Modification, Authoring User, and File Path.\r\n\r\n7. FILING AND AUDIT TRAIL RECORDS All records, including emails, internal memos, or \"Records Disposal Authorizations\" (Form RC-075), that document the date this document was placed into the physical folder of the Health Department.\r\n\r\nRecords obtained recently from the Office of the Public Records Administrator show that the latest records destroyed by the Danbury Health Department are from 2017. If any of these requested records have been destroyed, please include the properly executed RC-075 documents. I am also requesting that the Health Department refrain from destroying any records in connection with Hat City Ale house, Kevin Paige, or Paige Enterprises, Inc. until the fulfillment of this request is considered complete by both parties.\r\n\r\nFormat: Per CGS \u00a7 1-212(g), I request these records in their original electronic format to preserve the integrity of the embedded metadata. Providing a scanned PDF or a paper printout of an electronic file is a \"denial of access\" to the metadata which is itself a public record.\r\n\r\nFeel free to respond through this portal if there is any need for clarification of this request.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

A copy of the document is attached to this FOI request.\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirement: I am specifically requesting the metadata associated with this file, including but not limited to: Date of Creation, Date of Last Modification, Authoring User, and File Path.\r\n\r\n2. FILING AND AUDIT TRAIL RECORDS All records, including emails, internal memos, or \"Records Disposal Authorizations\" (Form RC-075), that document the date this document was placed into the physical folder of the Health Department.\r\n\r\n3.  THE \"CEASE AND DESIST\" NATIVE FILE A copy of the native electronic file (original .doc, .docx, or .pdf format) for the document titled or known as the \"CEASE AND DESIST\" authored by Lisa Morrissey, Health Department Director and prepared by Fernada Carvalho as noted by initials on the face of the document regarding Hat City Ale House. A copy of the document is attached to this FOI request.\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirement: I am specifically requesting the metadata associated with this file, including but not limited to: Date of Creation, Date of Last Modification, Authoring User, and File Path.\r\n\r\n4. FILING AND AUDIT TRAIL RECORDS All records, including emails, internal memos, or \"Records Disposal Authorizations\" (Form RC-075), that document the date this document was placed into the physical folder of the Health Department.\r\n\r\n5. All communications with the Connecticut Health Department in connection with the above referenced documents and Hat City Ale House from May 2018 to the present.\r\n\r\n6. All copies of the above referenced documents in possession of Sean Hearty, both as Permit Center Director/Coordinator and Zoning Enforcement Officer, Danbury Planning and zoning.\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirement: I am specifically requesting the metadata associated with these files, including but not limited to: Date of Creation, Date of Last Modification, Authoring User, and File Path.\r\n\r\n7. FILING AND AUDIT TRAIL RECORDS All records, including emails, internal memos, or \"Records Disposal Authorizations\" (Form RC-075), that document the date this document was placed into the physical folder of the Health Department.\r\n\r\nRecords obtained recently from the Office of the Public Records Administrator show that the latest records destroyed by the Danbury Health Department are from 2017. If any of these requested records have been destroyed, please include the properly executed RC-075 documents. I am also requesting that the Health Department refrain from destroying any records in connection with Hat City Ale house, Kevin Paige, or Paige Enterprises, Inc. until the fulfillment of this request is considered complete by both parties.\r\n\r\nFormat: Per CGS \u00a7 1-212(g), I request these records in their original electronic format to preserve the integrity of the embedded metadata. Providing a scanned PDF or a paper printout of an electronic file is a \"denial of access\" to the metadata which is itself a public record.\r\n\r\nFeel free to respond through this portal if there is any need for clarification of this request.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Paige",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Connecticut Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. THE \"CASAGRANDE DRAFT\" NATIVE FILE A copy of the native electronic file (original .doc, .docx, or .pdf format) for the document titled or known as the \"Revised Statement of Planned BusinessOperation\" authored by Attorney Dan Casagrande, which was recently located in the Health Department files regarding Hat City Ale House. A copy of the document is page 5 of the attached file and was returned in a prior FOI request on 1/5/26. This document bears my signature and was never submitted by me. Dan Casagrande presented this altered document in a discussion conference in January 2024. It was not marked for discussion or draft purposes. Who placed it in the file is unknown. It's existence was discovered by me on March 13, 2024. Upon which I notified Farley Santos of the Mayors staff. Farley Santos assured me that it had been removed/destroyed on or about March 21, 2024. It currently remains in the health department folder and does not represent statements I have ever submitted to the City of Danbury.\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirement: I am specifically requesting the metadata associated with this file, including but not limited to: Date of Creation, Date of Last Modification, Authoring User, and File Path.\r\n\r\n2. FILING AND AUDIT TRAIL RECORDS All records, including emails, internal memos, or \"Records Disposal Authorizations\" (Form RC-075), that document the date this document was placed into the physical folder of the Health Department.\r\n\r\n3. 2018 INTAKE RECORDS The original 13-page \"Intake Form\" or inspection report from the 2018 initial issuance of Food Service License for Hat City Ale House. If this record has been destroyed, please provide the corresponding RC-075 form authorizing its destruction as required by the State Library\u2019s retention schedule.\r\n\r\nFormat: Per CGS \u00a7 1-212(g), I request these records in their original electronic format to preserve the integrity of the embedded metadata. Providing a scanned PDF or a paper printout of an electronic file is a \"denial of access\" to the metadata which is itself a public record.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Paige",

It seems more likely that the records you are looking for would be held by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\r\n\r\nIf you did intend to send this request to NNSA, could you please specify which offices you believe might maintain the records you are seeking? Please note that the NNSA nuclear security enterprise spans eight sites, which include three national laboratories, production plants, numerous program offices in Washington, DC, and other facilities across the country.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 10 CFR \u00a7 1004.4(b) \"A request for access to records must be submitted in writing and must reasonably describe the records requested to enable DOE personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Where possible, specific information regarding dates, titles, file designations, and other information which may help identify the records should be supplied by the requester, including the names and titles of any DOE officers or employees who have been contacted regarding the request prior to submission of a written request.\"\r\n\r\nA reasonable description of the desired materials must include the location of the search.  Please provide a reasonable description of the records sought to include specific information about each record as described in the paragraph above and identify the NNSA component or office you believe created and/or controls the record(s).  Please keep in mind that the FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, conduct search projects, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.\r\n\r\nThis request will not be processed until we hear from you. If we do not hear from you by February 23, 2026, we will assume you are no longer interested in pursuing this request and will close the request.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nCorrina Cooke\r\nCE2 Contractor\r\nSr. FOIA/PA Analyst / Deputy Project Mgr.\r\nDOE/NNSA Office of General Counsel\r\n505-845-5322\r\ncorrina.cooke@nnsa.doe.gov<mailto:corrina.cooke@nnsa.doe.gov>\n",
