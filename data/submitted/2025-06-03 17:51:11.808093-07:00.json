If it is your position that a document contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nFurther, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition, I ask that your agency exercise its discretion to release records which may be technically exempt, but where withholding serves no important public interest.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIf a portion of the responsive records become available before the entire request is complete, I respectfully request that the DOJ provide records on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Subject: ALPR Audit Reports Review by Chief of Police Schenita Stewart\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request records related to the Evanston Police Department\u2019s (EPD) use of Flock Safety automated license plate reader (ALPR) technology. This request is based on a recent communication from Schenita Stewart, Chief of Police regarding state surveillance and Evanston\u2019s Welcoming City Ordinance:\r\n\r\n\u201cTo ensure compliance with the Welcoming City Ordinance and protect community trust, I have assigned a dedicated supervisor to oversee all aspects of ALPR usage within EPD. Furthermore, we conduct regular organizational and network audits, which I personally review. EPD also operates under a clear and established policy governing ALPR use, reinforcing both accountability and transparency.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to the City of Evanston's website page on the \"Welcoming City Ordinance\" (Ordinance 17-O-25):\r\n\r\n\"Key updates to the Ordinance include:\r\n\r\nData Protection: Prohibiting the sharing of city databases or information with federal immigration agencies, or with third parties unless they certify against its use for civil immigration enforcement.\r\n\r\nExpanded Safeguards: Clarifying that City officials will not participate in civil immigration enforcement by any agency or personnel, including private contractors. The City will continue to comply with a valid criminal warrant.\r\n\r\nClosing Loopholes: Strengthening policies to eliminate exceptions that previously allowed limited City involvement in immigration enforcement under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nSupport for Immigrants: Codifying practices that assist crime victims in obtaining specific visas and providing immigration resource information through public services like 311.\r\n\r\nSafe Public Buildings: The City is now tasked with developing policies for its public facilities that prioritize limiting immigration enforcement operations on their premises to the fullest extent allowed by law.\"\r\n\r\nIn light of this statement made by Schenita Stewart, Chief of Police, along with the updates to Evanston's Welcoming City Ordinance, and in accordance with Illinois law (625 ILCS 5/2-130), which prohibits sharing automated license plate reader ALPR data with out-of-state agencies for purposes such as interfering with reproductive health access or enforcing immigration laws, I request full transparency for the following:\r\n\r\n1) Any records showing review or oversight of Flock Safety automated license plate reader ALPR Organization or Network audit reports by the Chief of Police Schenita Stewart from January 1, 2024, to the present - including emails, memos, meeting notes, audit summaries, annotations, or briefings demonstrating the Stewart\u2019s direct involvement in reviewing audit data.\r\n\r\n2) Any communications between the Chief of Police Schenita Stewart and Evanston Police Department supervisors or Flock Safety automated license plate reader ALPR administrators regarding network audit findings that raised questions or concerns, including but not limited to:\r\n    a) Access by out-of-state agencies (e.g., AL, FL, IN, KY, MO, NC, TX, etc) \r\n    b) Federal agency involvement (e.g., DHS, HSI, ICE, CBP, etc)\r\n    c) References to abortion or reproductive health care (e.g., abortion, women, woman, pregnant, pp, planned parenthood, etc)\r\n    d) References to immigration enforcement (e.g., immigration, border patrol, 287g, etc)\r\n    e) Search reasons lacking case numbers or specific descriptions (e.g., inv, p, m, zz, training, test, ab501, invest, narcotics, drugs, 123abv, etc)\r\n\r\n3) Any internal protocols or policies that describe the role of the Evanston Police Department\u2019s chief or supervisors in reviewing Flock Safety automated license plate reader ALPR audits and identifying potentially inappropriate use, particularly regarding compliance with Illinois statutes and Evanston\u2019s Welcoming City Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nNiles Coalition",
