If this type of report is not available at this level of substance-specific granularity, I request instead access to reports that detail the numbers of packages containing pharmaceuticals that have been stopped for their contents. \r\n\r\n4) All FOIA processing notes associated with FOIA No. 2019-FPIS-00273\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I request records both from the Department of Defense connected to the separations, guiding policy and their requirements under Executive Order 14183, as well as records regarding individual service members' self-identification and voluntary separation. \r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI request a complete waiver of all search and duplication fees. If my request for a waiver is denied, I request that I be considered a member of the news media for fee purposes. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nUnder the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, agencies must adopt a presumption of disclosure, withholding information \u201conly if . . . disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption\u201d or \u201cdisclosure is prohibited by law.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 also amended the FOIA as follows (5 USC 552(a)(8)):\r\n\r\n(A) An agency shall\u2014\r\n(i) withhold information under this section only if\u2014\r\n(I) the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b); or\r\n(II) disclosure is prohibited by law; and\r\n(ii) (I) consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible; and\r\n(II) take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information. . .\r\n\r\nIn the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records. If it is your position that a document contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nFurther, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition, I ask that your agency exercise its discretion to release records which may be technically exempt, but where withholding serves no important public interest.\r\n\r\nIf a portion of the responsive records become available before the entire request is complete, I respectfully request that the department provide records on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIleana Garnand",

If you conclude that portions of the records that I request are exempt from disclosure, please release the remainder of such records for inspection and copying, redacting only the portion or portions that you claim are exempt. For any exemptions, please note whether it is discretionary and, if so, the basis for refusing to exercise discretion in favor of granting access.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The other schools we\u2019re contacting for data to use in the trends analysis found that helpful as when we get the data from multiple sources it needs to end up being \u201capples to apples\u201d.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe overall purpose of the project is to do a comparative analysis of admissions for Peer or near-peer colleges and university to identify trends that may impact planning and execution of admissions strategies and goals. To that end we need not only the student demographics, but the application and admissions timelines.\r\n\r\nFor example. If the majority of applicants do not make their decision on completing the application or accepting the offer to attend until shortly before a matriculation date that creates a serious planning issue for Institutions like VMI who have to plan for a wide range and do not have sufficient reaction time to implement mitigations strategies. This would be of benefit to many colleges as we do not believe such analysis is ongoing.\r\n\r\nIn VMI\u2019s case there was one year where it appears due to COVID and other factors enrollment (those who matriculated) was extremely low. If the perspective students did not notify VMI until shortly before (or just did not show up) it puts the school in a bind to provide opportunities to others and, more importantly, may have left some good potential students without sufficient time to react and arrive to matriculate.\r\n\r\nIt is one goal to see what the trend is for today\u2019s freshmen on when they make the decisions and what visibility schools have of that.\r\n\r\nAcademic years covered:\r\n\r\n2015 - 2016\r\n2016 - 2017\r\n2017 - 2018\r\n2018 - 2019\r\n2019 - 2020\r\n2020 - 2021\r\n2021 - 2022\r\n2022 - 2023\r\n2023 - 2024\r\n2024 - 2025\r\n\r\nREQUEST 1: An excel or .CSV file of the entire SSR database (report) as provided in the last FOIA with all fields, except for PII and an explanation of the field codes.\r\n\r\nThis would be the best as it would require little to no level of effort on VMI\u2019s part to simply export the entire file(s) without any PII fields. \r\n\r\nWe respectfully request this as it may have some fields we do not know exist in the report/database that could be valuable in our research.\r\n\r\nALETRNATE: If it is not possible to just provide files of the entire database (minus PII) we request the following.\r\n\r\n1.\tA list of all SSR codes and their meaning for all fields in the SSR Database.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe breakout of ALL applicants to VMI by race, ethnicity, gender, and within each of those, which were athletes and non-athletes:\r\n\r\na.\tDate of initial contact\r\nb.\tDate of Initial Application\r\nc.\tDate of full application competition\r\nd.\tDate Accepted or Declined by VMI (i.e. Appointment or denied appointment)\r\ne.\tDate of partial deposit\r\nf.\tDate of full deposit\r\ng.\tDate CAD- cancelled after paying the deposit (but before becoming a full reservation)\r\nh.\tDate CBD- cancelled before paying the deposit\r\ni.\tDate CR- cancelled after becoming a full reservation (deposit paid and medicals approved)\r\nj.\tDate TDMD- appointed but medically disqualified\r\nk.\tDate MT- matriculated\r\nl.\tOther fields that will allow developing trends and profiles of the timeline between cadets applying to VMI and final disposition if they attend or not.\r\n\r\n3. The number and dollar value of each scholarship or tuition assistance for each MT cadet by race, ethnicity, gender, and within each of those, which were athletes and non-athletes, with the source of funding (e.g., VMI Agencies, Federal Government, VMI internal funds, other).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear Wendy Sawyer: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P060600-072025.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G. Callahan \r\nCustodian of Records \r\n \r\nLogin Link: https://mshp.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/Login.aspx",
