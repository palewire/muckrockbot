A list of all Treaties, memoranda of understanding and/or agreements entered into by officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on behalf of the U.S. Government with foreign government or representatives thereof since 2003 including, but not limited to the terms \"Science and Technology Cooperation,\" \"counterterrorism\" or similar wording.\r\n2. Any and all documents showing that FBI has the legal authority to negotiate and/or execute Treaties, memoranda of understanding and/or agreements on behalf of the U.S. Government with foreign governments.\r\n3. Documents showing that the U.S. Senate has approved agreements negotiated and signed by FBI personnel.\r\n4. All documents showing that Mr. Kable had the legal authority to negotiate and/or execute Treaties, memoranda of understanding and/or agreements on behalf of the U.S. Government with foreign governments.\r\n5. Documents showing that the U.S. Senate approved the agreement negotiated and signed by Charles Kable with the Interior Minister of Croatia.\r\n\r\nThe term \u201cdocument\u201d is to be liberally construed to include any file, paper, microfilm, digital archive, or any other format where the information sought may be stored. The term \u201cdocument\u201d includes both the principal document responsive to the request as well as any studies, exhibits, supporting documentation or supplement thereof.\r\nAs you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nRequest for expedited processing\r\nTargeted Justice currently has over 20,500 subscribers and over 150,000  views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. Targeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nIf you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 832-247-3046. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAna L. Toledo, Esq. for\r\nTargeted Justice, Inc.\r\nP.O. Box 15990\r\nHouston, TX 77220\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

A sampling of my published articles includes analyses of civil asset forfeiture practices within\r\nvarious police departments, public schools' firewall policies and user groups, and communities standing\r\nup against bigotry and hate.\r\n\r\nThese articles can be found at the following links:\r\n1. New York City Police Department's Civil Asset Forfeiture Records: A Battle for Transparency\r\n(https://www.transparencyreport.pw/2023/02/27/new-york-city-police-departments-civil-asset-\r\nforfeiture-records-a-battle-for-transparency/)\r\n\r\n2.

Duval County Public Schools of Jacksonville, FL Releases Information on Firewall Policies and\r\nUsergroups\r\n(https://www.transparencyreport.pw/2023/03/07/duval-county-public-schools-of-jacksonville-fl-\r\nreleases-information-on-firewall-policies-and-usergroups/)\r\n\r\n4. Roanoke Barrel Babes Drag Brunch: Standing Up Against Bigotry and Hate\r\n(https://www.transparencyreport.pw/2023/03/23/roanoke-barrel-babes-drag-brunch-standing-up-\r\nagainst-bigotry-and-hate/)\r\n\r\nI certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing reasons for expedited processing are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\nV. REQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI request a complete waiver of all search, review, and duplication fees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k), and judicial precedents including Cause of Action v. Federal Trade Commission, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015) and Carney v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814 (2d Cir. 1994) on the following grounds:\r\n\r\nDisclosure Will Significantly Contribute to Public Understanding: The requested information concerns identifiable operations and activities of the federal government\u2014specifically, actions taken by the DOJ regarding social media content moderation that may affect millions of Americans. As recognized in Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 846 F.3d 1235 (D.C. Cir. 2017), information about government policy formation processes substantially contributes to public understanding of government operations.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest: This request is not made for any commercial interest. As established in National Security Archive v. DOD, 880 F.2d 1381 (D.C. Cir. 1989), journalists seeking information to disseminate to the public qualify for fee waivers when the disclosure is in the public interest.\r\n\r\nDissemination Ability: As an investigative journalist with I have demonstrated ability to disseminate information of public interest to a broad audience. Courts have consistently recognized that the news media serves a critical role in assisting the public in understanding government activities, as noted in Electronic Privacy Information Center v. Department of Defense, 241 F.Supp.2d 5, 11-12 (D.D.C. 2003).\r\nPublic Interest Value: Understanding how the Trump administration approaches social media content regulation across both terms (2017-2021 and 2025-present) is of significant public interest, as it directly impacts public discourse, access to information, and First Amendment rights. The D.C. Circuit in Cause of Action v. FTC, 799 F.3d 1108, 1115-18 (D.C. Cir. 2015) specifically recognized that records that \"shed light on an agency's performance of its statutory duties\" qualify for fee waivers.\r\n\r\nEducational Value: These records will provide invaluable historical context and educational material about the evolution of government policies regarding digital speech platforms. As recognized in Prison Legal News v. Lappin, 436 F. Supp. 2d 17, 26 (D.D.C. 2006), materials that advance public knowledge about government activities serve an educational purpose qualifying for fee waivers.\r\n\r\nImpact on Core Constitutional Values: The requested records directly relate to government actions potentially impacting First Amendment freedoms, which courts have recognized as warranting heightened public access. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (finding that government accountability, particularly regarding constitutional rights, strongly favors fee waivers).\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, please notify me before incurring costs exceeding $100, as required by 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(e). Please also note that improper denial of fee waivers is subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(vii).\r\n\r\nVI. FORMAT OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records in their native electronic formats with all metadata intact. Specifically:\r\n\r\nEmails: Please provide in .MSG or .EML format with complete headers, metadata, attachments, and BCC information.\r\n\r\nDocuments: Please provide in their original formats (e.g., .DOCX, .XLSX, .PPTX, .PDF) with all metadata.\r\nDatabases or Structured Data: Please provide in their original format or in .CSV or .XML format with data dictionaries.\r\n\r\nCommunication Records: For text messages, instant messages, or other electronic communications, please provide in a format that preserves threading, timestamps, and participant information.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the requested records exists in electronic form, I request they be provided in electronic format. For any records that exist only in paper form, please provide high-resolution color scans (at least 300 dpi) in PDF format.\r\n\r\nVII. PRESERVATION REQUEST\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records. This explicitly includes preserving all original metadata, and ensuring that automated email or document deletion systems do not destroy any potentially responsive records.\r\n\r\nVIII. REQUEST FOR VAUGHN INDEX\r\n\r\nIf any responsive records are withheld or redacted, I request a detailed Vaughn index that:\r\n\r\nIdentifies each document withheld or redacted with specificity;\r\nStates the statutory exemption claimed;\r\n\r\nExplains how disclosure would damage the interests protected by the claimed exemption with specificity;\r\n\r\nProvides any segregable portions of the records; and\r\nExplains any discretionary release decisions.\r\n\r\nThe index should contain sufficient information for me to assess the applicability of any exemptions and the feasibility of a legal challenge to any withholdings.\r\n\r\nIX. REQUEST FOR ADMINISTRATIVE TRACKING AND SEARCH DOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: DETAILED SEARCH DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED BY LAW\r\n\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B), DOJ v. Reporters Committee, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), and Oglesby v. Department of the Army, 920 F.2d 57 (D.C. Cir. 1990), I am entitled to detailed information about the search methodology used. Therefore, I hereby require the following specific documentation as part of the agency's response:\r\n\r\nThe tracking number assigned to this request;\r\nThe name of the FOIA officer(s) processing this request;\r\nA detailed description of the search methodology used to identify responsive records, including:\r\n\r\nComplete list of systems, databases, and repositories searched (ALL systems listed in Section II must be included, with specific justification for any omissions)\r\nSearch terms used for each system, including any variations, with exact spelling and syntax\r\nDate ranges searched for each system, with specific notation of any date limitations or exclusions\r\n\r\nPersonnel involved in the search, including their full names, titles, and responsibilities\r\n\r\nTime spent conducting searches by each individual, broken down by system searched\r\n\r\nAny search term limiters, modifiers, Boolean operators, or exclusions applied\r\n\r\nRecords of search queries run, including timestamps and results counts for each query\r\n\r\nDocumentation of any technical limitations encountered during searches\r\n\r\nRecords of any decisions to exclude certain systems from searching, with detailed justification\r\n\r\nComplete search logs from the FOIAXpress and Advanced Search Tool systems\r\n\r\nIf applicable, documentation of any de-duplication processes applied to search results, including parameters used and number of records removed\r\nCertification by the Information Management Officer that all potentially responsive systems were searched\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that courts have consistently held that agencies must demonstrate that searches were \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents\" (Truitt v. Department of State, 897 F.2d 540, 542 (D.C. Cir. 1990)) and that the agency cannot limit its search to \"one or more places if there are additional sources that are likely to turn up the information requested\" (Valencia-Lucena v. U.S. Coast Guard, 180 F.3d 321, 326 (D.C. Cir. 1999)).\r\n\r\nUnder the \"reasonably calculated\" standard established in Founding Church of Scientology v. NSA, 610 F.2d 824 (D.C. Cir. 1979), failure to search each system listed in Section II or to document each search as specified above will be considered evidence of an inadequate search and will be cited as grounds for immediate appeal and potential litigation.\r\n\r\nX. RIGHT TO APPEAL AND JUDICIAL REVIEW\r\n\r\nI expressly reserve the right to appeal any adverse determination regarding this request, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\nDenials of expedited processing\r\n\r\nDenials of fee waivers\r\n\r\nDeterminations regarding the adequacy of searches\r\nWithholdings or redactions based on FOIA exemptions\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that courts have consistently held that agencies must provide requesters with sufficient information to make informed decisions regarding potential litigation, including detailed justifications for any withholdings.\r\n\r\nXI. STATUTORY TIME LIMITS AND LITIGATION\r\n\r\nI expect a determination on this request within the statutory time limits specified in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i) (20 working days) and, if expedited processing is granted, within the accelerated timeframe specified in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I) (10 calendar days).\r\n\r\nI direct your attention to the following statutory and regulatory provisions governing FOIA compliance:\r\n\r\nConstructive Exhaustion: Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(i), failure to comply with applicable time limits shall be deemed constructive exhaustion of administrative remedies, permitting immediate judicial review.\r\nLitigation Costs: Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E), a court may assess reasonable attorney fees and litigation costs against the United States if the complainant substantially prevails, which courts have interpreted to include cases where an agency improperly delays or obstructs FOIA processing.\r\n\r\nSpecial Counsel Referral: Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(F), when a court issues a written finding that agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to withholding records, the Special Counsel shall promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted.\r\n\r\nForeseeable Harm Standard: Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i), an agency may withhold information only if it reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption, or if disclosure is prohibited by law.\r\n\r\nRule of Construction: Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii), whenever full disclosure is not possible, the FOIA \"requires that any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.\"\r\n\r\nYOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED that failure to comply with the statutory deadlines will result in immediate legal action under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this request and provide a tracking number within 5 working days, as required by FOIA. If you have any questions or require clarification, please contact me rather than using delay tactics or issuing improper denials.\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nInvestigative Journalist",

ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to . \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \nPICK ONE OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS AND DELETE THE OTHERS THAT DO NOT APPLY. ALSO DELETE ANY BOLDED WORDS. \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \nOR \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).   You have not established that lack of expedited treatment in this case will pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.  The information sought in your request is retrospective and you have not established that the information would have a bearing on immediate or resultant future situations.  In addition, you are not primarily engaged in the dissemination of information to the public. You have not shown that you have the ability to educate the public beyond (XXXX\u2019s) limited constituency, nor have you established with the requisite specificity why you feel there is an urgency to inform your limited audience about past ICE actions. Qualifying urgency would need to exceed the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Finally, you did not offer any supporting evidence of public interest that is any greater than the public\u2019s general interest in (SUBJECT OF REQUEST). \nOR \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).   You have not established that lack of expedited treatment in this case will pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.  While you may be primarily engaged in the dissemination of information, you have not detailed with specificity why you feel there is an urgency to inform the public about (SUBJECT OF REQUEST).  Qualifying urgency would need to exceed the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  You also did not offer sufficient supporting evidence of an interest of the public t greater than the public\u2019s general interest in (SUBJECT OF REQUEST).  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \n\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \n\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25084.

Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \n\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \n\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to a copy of (a) the OPR - ERAU Detainee Death Report and (b) the accompanying Creative Corrections Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis for Cambric Dennis, who died in ICE Custody May 22, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddr-DennisCambric.pdf. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).

We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to commercial requesters.  As a commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication, and for search and review time at the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher and reviewer.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to a copy of (a) the OPR - ERAU Detainee Death Report and (b) the accompanying Creative Corrections Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis for Edixon Del Jesus Farias Farias who died in ICE Custody April 18, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrFarias-FariasEdixondelJesus.pdf. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \n\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \n\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25082. Please use this number in future correspondence. \n\nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA Office \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nFreedom of Information Act Office \n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths.

We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \n\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to OPR - ERAU Detainee Death Report and (b) the accompanying Creative Corrections Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis for Charles Leo Daniel. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).   You have not established that lack of expedited treatment in this case will pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.  While you may be primarily engaged in the dissemination of information, you have not detailed with specificity why you feel there is an urgency to inform the public about records pertaining to OPR - ERAU Detainee Death Report and (b) the accompanying Creative Corrections Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis for Charles Leo Daniel.  Qualifying urgency would need to exceed the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  You also did not offer sufficient supporting evidence of an interest of the public t greater than the public\u2019s general interest in records pertaining to OPR - ERAU Detainee Death Report and (b) the accompanying Creative Corrections Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis for Charles Leo Daniel.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \n\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.

Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \n\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to OPR - ERAU Detainee Death Report and the accompanying Creative Corrections Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis for Ousmane Ba. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).   You have not established that lack of expedited treatment in this case will pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.  While you may be primarily engaged in the dissemination of information, you have not detailed with specificity why you feel there is an urgency to inform the public about records pertaining to OPR - ERAU Detainee Death Report and the accompanying Creative Corrections Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis for Ousmane Ba Qualifying urgency would need to exceed the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  You also did not offer sufficient supporting evidence of an interest of the public t greater than the public\u2019s general interest in records pertaining to OPR - ERAU Detainee Death Report and the accompanying Creative Corrections Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis for Ousmane Ba. Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \n\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors one through six.  Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \n\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25079. Please use this number in future correspondence. \n\nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA Office \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nFreedom of Information Act Office \n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

I have considered the following factors in my evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nUpon review of your request and a careful consideration of the factors listed above, I have determined to grant your request for a fee waiver. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).   You have not established that lack of expedited treatment in this case will pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.  While you may be primarily engaged in the dissemination of information, you have not detailed with specificity why you feel there is an urgency to inform the public about records pertaining to Julio Cesar Chirino Peralta.  Qualifying urgency would need to exceed the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  You also did not offer sufficient supporting evidence of an interest of the public t greater than the public\u2019s general interest in records pertaining to Julio Cesar Chirino Peralta.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25078.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to ERAU Detainee Death Report and accompanying Creative Corrections Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis for Subash Shrestha. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nICE evaluates fee waiver requests under the legal standard set forth above and the fee waiver policy guidance issued by the Department of Justice on April 2, 1987, as incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Freedom of Information Act regulations.  These regulations set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for fee waiver has been met.  I have considered the following factors in my evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nUpon review of your request and a careful consideration of the factors listed above, I have determined to grant your request for a fee waiver. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to ERAU Detainee Death Report and accompanying Creative Corrections Healthcare and Security Compliance Analysis for Carlos Juan Francisco. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nICE evaluates fee waiver requests under the legal standard set forth above and the fee waiver policy guidance issued by the Department of Justice on April 2, 1987, as incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Freedom of Information Act regulations.  These regulations set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for fee waiver has been met.  I have considered the following factors in my evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nUpon review of your request and a careful consideration of the factors listed above, I have determined to grant your request for a fee waiver. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).   You have not established that lack of expedited treatment in this case will pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.  While you may be primarily engaged in the dissemination of information, you have not detailed with specificity why you feel there is an urgency to inform the public about   Qualifying urgency would need to exceed the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  You also did not offer sufficient supporting evidence of an interest of the public t greater than the public\u2019s general interest in records pertaining to the death o fCarlos Juan Francisco.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25076. Please use this number in future correspondence. \n\nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA Office \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nFreedom of Information Act Office \n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse.

IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to A copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Subash Shrestha, who died in ICE Custody November 13, 2023, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddr_subashShrestha.pdf. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nICE evaluates fee waiver requests under the legal standard set forth above and the fee waiver policy guidance issued by the Department of Justice on April 2, 1987, as incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Freedom of Information Act regulations.  These regulations set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for fee waiver has been met.  I have considered the following factors in my evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nUpon review of your request and a careful consideration of the factors listed above, I have determined to grant your request for a fee waiver. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to A copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Julio Cesar Chirino Peralta, who died in ICE Custody October 8, 2023, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrJulioCesarChirinoPeralta.pdf \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nICE evaluates fee waiver requests under the legal standard set forth above and the fee waiver policy guidance issued by the Department of Justice on April 2, 1987, as incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Freedom of Information Act regulations.  These regulations set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for fee waiver has been met.  I have considered the following factors in my evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nUpon review of your request and a careful consideration of the factors listed above, I have determined to grant your request for a fee waiver. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25071.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to A copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Charles Leo Daniel, who died in ICE Custody March 7, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrDanielCharlesLeo.pdf.. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nICE evaluates fee waiver requests under the legal standard set forth above and the fee waiver policy guidance issued by the Department of Justice on April 2, 1987, as incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Freedom of Information Act regulations.  These regulations set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for fee waiver has been met.  I have considered the following factors in my evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nUpon review of your request and a careful consideration of the factors listed above, I have determined to grant your request for a fee waiver. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25069. Please use this number in future correspondence. \n\nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA Office \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nFreedom of Information Act Office \n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \n\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3. The current administration's expansion of federal immigration detention is the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.

        "communication": "03/13/2025 \n\nAndrew  Free \nMuckRock News, DEPT MR182991 \nBoston, Massachusetts 02115 \n\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2025-ICFO-25067 \n \nDear Requester: \n\nThis acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 3/13/2025, your request for a waiver of all assessable FOIA fees, and your request for expedited treatment. Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Edixon Del Jesus Farias Farias who died in ICE Custody April 18, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddrFarias-FariasEdixondelJesus.pdf. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \n\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \n\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Cambric Dennis, who died in ICE Custody May 22, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddr-DennisCambric.pdf\r\n\r\nI make this request as a member of the media, and therefore seek a fee waiver. Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3. The current administration's expansion of federal immigration detention is the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence. See, e.g., \r\na. https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/how-many-immigrants-will-die-in-us-custody\r\nb. https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/ice-increases-detention-capacity-in-southern-nevada-3318591/&ct=ga&cd=CAEYAioTODA4NDM3NjM3MDcwNDg3MjU0NDIaMzU4OGE4OGMwMWViNjNlYTpjb206ZW46VVM&usg=AOvVaw0AY_z02AvW4eN7-HW7Pbvr\r\nc. https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/ice-increases-detention-capacity-in-southern-nevada-3318591/\r\nd. https://www.leavenworthtimes.com/kansas-politicians-say-an-awful-lot-but-look-beyond-those-words/\r\ne. https://latenighter.com/news/john-oliver-shares-chilling-details-about-ice-detention/\r\nf. https://www.bisnow.com/national/news/capital-markets/private-prison-firms-predict-unprecedented-growth-from-trumps-immigration-crackdown-128291\r\ng. https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/youngstown-news/corecivic-trying-to-add-space-for-ice-detainees/\r\nh. https://prismreports.org/2025/01/15/biden-immigration-migrant-deaths/\r\ni. https://prismreports.org/2024/06/25/nearly-all-deaths-in-ice-detention-over-5-years-were-preventable/\r\nj. https://www.kcbd.com/2025/03/11/garza-county-now-reviewing-proposals-interested-giles-w-dalby-correctional-facility-operators/\r\nk. https://capitalandmain.com/more-people-in-ice-custody-means-smaller-meals-and-delayed-medical-care-detainees-say\r\nl. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/11/german-tourists-ordeal-reportedly-ending-returned-from-us-detention\r\nm. https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/11/denver-ice-expand-detention-capacity-colorado-wyoming/\r\nn. https://www.aclufl.org/en/press-releases/three-deaths-ice-custody-just-over-month-trumps-presidency-marks-most-deaths-occur\r\no. https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/privately-run-immigration-detention-center-that-previously-held-families-in-texas-will-reopen/\r\np. https://www.natchezdemocrat.com/2025/03/05/a-city-within-a-city-wardens-at-adams-county-correctional-discuss-benefits-challenges-of-max-occupancy-at-ice-facility/\r\nq. https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/live-updates/trump-2nd-term-live-updates-va-prepares-to-cut-as-many-as-72000-employees-in-next-wave-of-layoffs-memo-119377651\r\nr. https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/03/05/dilley-texas-family-detention-center-ice/\r\ns. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corecivic-announces-resumption-operations-south-211500232.html\r\nt. https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2025/mar/04/for-profit-kansas-prison-with-troubled-history-cou/\r\nu. https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/private-prison-mass-deportation-trump-billions-geogroup-corecivic-ice/\r\nv. https://filtermag.org/trump-deportations-private-prisons/amp/\r\nw. https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/corecivic-immigrant-family-detention-center-texas\r\nx. https://theappeal.org/mahmoud-khalil-lasalle-detention-center-louisiana/\r\ny. https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/news/students-document-reports-abuse-immigration-detention-center\r\nz. https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/02/20/521935/\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Cambric Dennis, who died in ICE Custody May 22, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddr-DennisCambric.pdf. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \n\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \n\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.

Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3. The current administration's expansion of federal immigration detention is the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested records pertaining to a copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Hugo Roberto Boror-Urla, who died in ICE Custody May 22, 2024, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published:https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddr-BororUrlaHugoRoberto.pdf. \n\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \n\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \n\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25065. Please use this number in future correspondence. \nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA Office \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nFreedom of Information Act Office \n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \n\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \n\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \n\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \n\nAfter thoroughly reviewing your letter and request for fee waiver, I have determined that you have not presented a convincing argument that you and/or your organization is entitled to a blanket waiver of applicable fees. \n\nThe DHS FOIA Regulations at 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k)(2) set forth six factors to examine in determining whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met.  We will consider these factors in our evaluation of your request for a fee waiver: \n\n(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government\u201d; \n(2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities; \n(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons; \n(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \"significant\"; \n(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and \n(6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requestor is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. \n\nAs a requester, you bear the burden under FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on my review of your 3/13/2025 letter and for the reasons stated herein, I have determined that your fee waiver request is deficient because your request did not satisfy factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since your request for a fee waiver has failed to satisfy each of the required factors, I am denying your fee waiver request. \n\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \n\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment and fee waiver for your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25064. Please use this number in future correspondence. \nSincerely, \n\nICE FOIA Office \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \nFreedom of Information Act Office \n500 12th Street, S.W., Stop 5009 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5009",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of the IHSC Mortality Review for Serawit Gezahegn Dejene, (DOB: 3/29/79; COC: Ethiopia) who died January 29, 2025, following his detention at the Eloy Detention Center (EDC) in Eloy, Arizona, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddr-SerawitGezahegnDejene.pdf. \r\n\r\nI make this request as a member of the media, and therefore seek a fee waiver. Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse. See https://phr.org/our-work/resources/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/.\r\n\r\n3. The current administration's expansion of federal immigration detention is the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.

I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the Department of Homeland Security's conduct with respect to Mahmoud Khalil. \r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/trump-rubio-khalil-columbia-student-protests.html\r\nb. https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-mahmoud-khalil-ice-15014bcbb921f21a9f704d5acdcae7a8\r\nc. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-authorities-arrest-palestinian-student-protester-columbia-university-students-2025-03-09/\r\nd. https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/03/09/palestinian-activist-mahmoud-khalil-sipa-24-detained-by-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-lawyer-says/\r\ne. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/09/ice-arrests-palestinian-activist-columbia-protests\r\nf. https://nypost.com/2025/03/09/us-news/ice-arrests-palestinian-leader-of-columbias-anti-israel-protests-lawyer/\r\ng. https://zeteo.com/p/breaking-dhs-detains-palestinian\r\nh. https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/dhs-detains-columbia-university-student-gaza\r\ni. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14478989/pro-palestinian-Columbia-graduate-arrested-ICE-campus-protests.html\r\nj. https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/02/04/trumps-antisemitism-order-leaves-many-questions\r\nk. https://reason.com/volokh/2025/02/03/may-aliens-be-deported-based-on-their-speech/\r\nl. https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/02/02/trumps-antisemitism-order-puts-foreign-students-and-us-colleges-on-notice/\r\nm. https://nypost.com/2025/02/01/opinion/deporting-pro-terror-protestors-will-to-restore-order-to-lawless-campuses/\r\nn. https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/g-s1-45468/trump-antisemitism-executive-order-protests-deport-hamas\r\no. https://www.jta.org/2025/01/30/politics/trumps-order-on-antisemitism-suggests-deporting-non-citizen-campus-activists-dividing-jewish-groups\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 6 CFR \u00a7 5.11(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by United States officials in response to campus protests.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

The dual role of Elon Musk as both owner of X Corp and a special government advisor creates an inherent potential conflict of interest that the public has an urgent need to understand, particularly if federal advertising expenditures are being redirected to benefit X Corp.\r\nMatter of Widespread Public Interest: The relationship between Elon Musk and the federal government, including his advisory role and any corresponding benefits to his business interests, has received substantial national media coverage and public interest. Major news outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN, and others have reported on these matters, indicating significant public concern.\r\nTime-Sensitive Nature: These records pertain to ongoing government activities and expenditures, with potential continuing effects on federal advertising decisions and budget allocations. Delay in disclosure would significantly reduce the value of the information to inform the public about current government activities.\r\nCredible Public Interest Journalism: As an established investigative journalist, I have a demonstrated track record of analyzing and disseminating information about government operations to a broad public audience. The requested information will be promptly analyzed and shared through established news media channels.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1303.70 (OMB), and 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 105-60.305-13 (GSA), I request a complete waiver of all search, review, and duplication fees associated with this request based on the following grounds:\r\n\r\nDisclosure Will Significantly Contribute to Public Understanding: The requested records will reveal previously undisclosed information about federal expenditures, potential conflicts of interest, and policy decisions regarding social media advertising that are not currently available to the general public. Specifically:\r\na) The requested records concern identified operations and activities of the federal government, namely the expenditure of taxpayer funds on advertising with X Corp and the potential influence of Elon Musk's advisory role on these decisions.\r\nb) Disclosure will be meaningfully informative and will enhance public understanding of government operations, as it will reveal the extent, nature, and timing of federal advertising expenditures with X Corp and any correlation with Musk's advisory role.\r\nc) The contribution to public understanding will be significant, as these records will allow for the first comprehensive analysis of federal advertising expenditures with X Corp following Musk's appointment as a government advisor.\r\nDisclosure Will Not Primarily Serve Commercial Interest: The primary purpose of this request is to inform the public about federal activities and expenditures:\r\na) As an investigative journalist, I will analyze these records and disseminate the information to the public through established news media channels, reaching a broad audience.\r\nb) Any commercial benefit that might accrue is incidental to the public purpose of informing citizens about government operations and expenditures.\r\nc) The public interest in disclosure far outweighs any commercial interest, as it concerns the potential conflicts of interest in the federal government's advertising decisions and expenditure of taxpayer funds.\r\n\r\nShould the fee waiver be denied, please notify me before incurring costs exceeding $100. I reserve the right to appeal any denial of the fee waiver request.\r\nFORMAT OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records in their native electronic format with all metadata intact. Specifically:\r\n\r\nElectronic Communications:\r\n\r\nEmails should be provided in .MSG or .EML format to preserve header information\r\nText messages or instant messages in their native format with metadata preserved\r\nCalendar items in .ICS format with attendee and scheduling information intact\r\n\r\n\r\nDocuments:\r\n\r\nWord processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in their native formats (.DOCX, .XLSX, .PPTX)\r\nIf converted to PDF, documents should be text-searchable and maintain metadata\r\nDatabase extracts in structured formats (.CSV, .XML, .JSON) with field descriptions\r\n\r\n\r\nContract and Financial Records:\r\n\r\nContracts in their complete form with all attachments\r\nFinancial data in machine-readable formats that maintain calculation formulas and relationships\r\nAnalytics reports in their original format with all charts, tables, and underlying data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION REQUEST AND RIGHT TO APPEAL\r\n\r\nI request that all responsive records be preserved in their entirety, including metadata, pending the processing of this request. If you determine that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that:\r\n\r\nYou provide a detailed Vaughn index specifically identifying each document withheld, the statutory exemption claimed, and a particularized explanation of how disclosure would damage the interests protected by the claimed exemption.\r\nYou release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of otherwise exempt records, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\nFor each withholding decision, you articulate in writing the specific \"foreseeable harm\" that would result from disclosure, as required by the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016.\r\n\r\nI expressly reserve the right to appeal any full or partial denial of this request, including any determinations regarding the applicability of exemptions, fee waiver denials, expedited processing denials, or regarding the adequacy of the search conducted. Further, I reserve the right to seek judicial review in federal court pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) if your agency fails to comply with FOIA's requirements.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request. As provided by statute, I anticipate a determination on expedited processing within 10 calendar days and a substantive response to this request within 20 working days. Please provide acknowledgment of receipt and a tracking number for this request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nInvestigative Journalist\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nDetailed Fee Waiver Justification",

The dual role of Elon Musk as both owner of X Corp and a special government advisor creates an inherent potential conflict of interest that the public has an urgent need to understand, particularly if federal advertising expenditures are being redirected to benefit X Corp.\r\nMatter of Widespread Public Interest: The relationship between Elon Musk and the federal government, including his advisory role and any corresponding benefits to his business interests, has received substantial national media coverage and public interest. Major news outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN, and others have reported on these matters, indicating significant public concern.\r\nTime-Sensitive Nature: These records pertain to ongoing government activities and expenditures, with potential continuing effects on federal advertising decisions and budget allocations. Delay in disclosure would significantly reduce the value of the information to inform the public about current government activities.\r\nCredible Public Interest Journalism: As an established investigative journalist, I have a demonstrated track record of analyzing and disseminating information about government operations to a broad public audience. The requested information will be promptly analyzed and shared through established news media channels.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1303.70 (OMB), and 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 105-60.305-13 (GSA), I request a complete waiver of all search, review, and duplication fees associated with this request based on the following grounds:\r\n\r\nDisclosure Will Significantly Contribute to Public Understanding: The requested records will reveal previously undisclosed information about federal expenditures, potential conflicts of interest, and policy decisions regarding social media advertising that are not currently available to the general public. Specifically:\r\na) The requested records concern identified operations and activities of the federal government, namely the expenditure of taxpayer funds on advertising with X Corp and the potential influence of Elon Musk's advisory role on these decisions.\r\nb) Disclosure will be meaningfully informative and will enhance public understanding of government operations, as it will reveal the extent, nature, and timing of federal advertising expenditures with X Corp and any correlation with Musk's advisory role.\r\nc) The contribution to public understanding will be significant, as these records will allow for the first comprehensive analysis of federal advertising expenditures with X Corp following Musk's appointment as a government advisor.\r\nDisclosure Will Not Primarily Serve Commercial Interest: The primary purpose of this request is to inform the public about federal activities and expenditures:\r\na) As an investigative journalist, I will analyze these records and disseminate the information to the public through established news media channels, reaching a broad audience.\r\nb) Any commercial benefit that might accrue is incidental to the public purpose of informing citizens about government operations and expenditures.\r\nc) The public interest in disclosure far outweighs any commercial interest, as it concerns the potential conflicts of interest in the federal government's advertising decisions and expenditure of taxpayer funds.\r\n\r\nShould the fee waiver be denied, please notify me before incurring costs exceeding $100. I reserve the right to appeal any denial of the fee waiver request.\r\nFORMAT OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records in their native electronic format with all metadata intact. Specifically:\r\n\r\nElectronic Communications:\r\n\r\nEmails should be provided in .MSG or .EML format to preserve header information\r\nText messages or instant messages in their native format with metadata preserved\r\nCalendar items in .ICS format with attendee and scheduling information intact\r\n\r\n\r\nDocuments:\r\n\r\nWord processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in their native formats (.DOCX, .XLSX, .PPTX)\r\nIf converted to PDF, documents should be text-searchable and maintain metadata\r\nDatabase extracts in structured formats (.CSV, .XML, .JSON) with field descriptions\r\n\r\n\r\nContract and Financial Records:\r\n\r\nContracts in their complete form with all attachments\r\nFinancial data in machine-readable formats that maintain calculation formulas and relationships\r\nAnalytics reports in their original format with all charts, tables, and underlying data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION REQUEST AND RIGHT TO APPEAL\r\n\r\nI request that all responsive records be preserved in their entirety, including metadata, pending the processing of this request. If you determine that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that:\r\n\r\nYou provide a detailed Vaughn index specifically identifying each document withheld, the statutory exemption claimed, and a particularized explanation of how disclosure would damage the interests protected by the claimed exemption.\r\nYou release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of otherwise exempt records, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\nFor each withholding decision, you articulate in writing the specific \"foreseeable harm\" that would result from disclosure, as required by the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016.\r\n\r\nI expressly reserve the right to appeal any full or partial denial of this request, including any determinations regarding the applicability of exemptions, fee waiver denials, expedited processing denials, or regarding the adequacy of the search conducted. Further, I reserve the right to seek judicial review in federal court pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) if your agency fails to comply with FOIA's requirements.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request.
