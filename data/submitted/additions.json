        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am filing against two officers from yesterday's parenting time pick up and drop off! The petitioner stated I can only come to her home for parenting time which is court ordered Mondays and Fridays 6:00-9:00pm I\u2019ll attach the text petitioner sent me indicating I can do pick up and drop offs at her home. I pleaded with the police saying I\u2019m allowed to be here! Why did she call the cops? no idea. Officers from 10/9/23 at 6:00pm (officer Sweeney don't know other officers name) were very rude! I lost time with my daughter due to this. This whole thing has been so uncalled for. And I will be heard and I will get justice. You never involve kids and that\u2019s what the petitioner has done. One officer had his hand on his holster as if he was going to shoot me. He was to my left hand side, while the other cop was to my right stating; I couldn\u2019t see my daughter and couldn\u2019t be there. I was inside my car. They waited until I left. I had to roll both my windows down and it was freezing! I guess my other concern is why would she indicate I can be there for my parenting time drop off and picks up but when I arrive cops were there waiting; second time now I deal with these exact cops. This is a court ordered parenting time which even states I can only go to petitioners home on the days of my parenting time that is what was done.  The cops denied me this is not ok.\r\n See attached text from petitioner! She even sent me half the HRO . I still haven\u2019t gotten it. Literally picked it up today 10.10.23. I lost time with my daughter. I can't get back due to these unprofessional cops who could have done more research and not be biased, especially since I am a woman of color. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nRuby Nivelo\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRuby Nivelo",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI would like to submit a Foia on all chemical spraying done by a california based corporation called Sierra Pacific Industries. With all permits granted from the department of forestery and cause and effects of the chemicals sprayed.  Pilots and workers who where exposed to these toxic chemicals.  Fish Studies and wildlife studies done if any on the effects of this chemical and gallons used and permits for each square area sprayed.  In Dec of 2019 this company held local public meetings in the grange hall and church and mis construed the public never telling anyone who was funding the meetings. I knew over the presenter who worked for the company. Not even in the paperwork given freely to the public or presenters was the words sierra pacific mentioned on whom was spraying. I lost my dog due to the spraying and sierra pacific never told the public whom owned land in front of the chemical spraying that such a thing was going on after clear cutting to replant trees or after logging had ended in a section of mountain. Since then we have had flooding and clogged up bridges we county tax payers pay to fix because of soil retention after they over log and destroy.  Violating state and federal law on the water rights act. Sierra Pacific has intentionally destroyed Coho Fish spawning along with violating property easements with chemical spraying and with cattle and Golden Eagle Nest that has existed for a few decades.  The Coho Salmon run which was plentiful and now due to global warming issues I have seen first hand this years Coho Fingerling s in the river are desimated.  This company is now going after those who have created salmon runs attacking them for their water rights which have been granted prior to the company purchasing the lands.   Why are they not telling the general public the truth on what they are spraying.  I am asking for all permits and how many gallons of toxic monsanto chemicals are being sprayed in skagit and whatcom county. One neighbor butchered cattle and cancerous tumors were in the meat. My property borders an easment and Sierra Sprayed chemicals into my property and lined the road they had an easment with what looked like perlite that melts in your hand if you have grease on your hands. They never told anyone locally they did things like this.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErick",
