McRoy was a newspaper journalist who wrote for the Meridian Star and Meridian Dispatch newspapers. He was also editor of sole publisher of a publication called \"The Truth\" in the 1930s and 40s. . McRoy was also a member of the Meridian, Mississippi school board. Attached is a copy of his obituary. An obituary described him as being, \"one of the most accurate-ethical newspaper men in state history.\"\r\n\r\nOf particular interest would be any bureau records related to articles he wrote - specifically any about crime, politics or the bureau itself - in the MERIDIAN STAR or MERIDIAN DISPATCH newspapers. Of additional interest would be bureau documents related to his \"The Truth\" publication. \r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search for any correspondence from Paul Douglas McRoy to J. Edgar Hoover, Clyde Tolson, or any other bureau employee. Please conduct a search for J. Edgar Hoover correspondence that mentions McRoy or articles that he published. \r\n\r\nThis is for records about Paul Douglas McRoy from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Ashe held by the Jackson, Mississippi field office. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Paul Douglas McRoy. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Paul Douglas McRoy. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or certain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
