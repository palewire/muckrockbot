        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTitle and Copy List of the district's library catalog including all titles, authors, ISBN and copy information (example copies/location). \r\n\r\nNote: This information can generally be easily retrieved by a district level user of Follett using the Generate a Title & Copy List Report (Library Manager) feature of the Follett catalogue. Instructions are attached and  located here https://legacyhelp.fsc.follett.com/content/t_generate_title_copy_list_report.htm. Please include all titles (regardless of status) and include the categories and circulation statistics. \r\n\r\nPlease output the file(s) as Excel.\r\n\r\nIn the event the report is limited by the 10,000 title limit, please split it the catalogue information into multiple groupings as the report allows. For instance you could limit the titles in each file by selecting groupings A-G and H-Z.\r\n\r\nAs censorship is at an all time high, we are conducting research on titles that may be most at risk of censorship across Texas. We hope to assist schools in their mission of maintaining young learners critical access to books in their libraries.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities. I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSidney Braveword",

Any policy, guidance, handbook, manual, or standard contract concerning the institution\u2019s interactions or relationship with members of the news media, reporters, or journalists, including but not limited to student journalists. \r\n\r\n2. Any policy, guidance, handbook, or manual concerning the interactions or communications of institutional employees, including faculty, administrators, staff, and student employees, with the news media, reporters, or journalists, including but not limited to student journalists. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9 Natta, a citizen of Alabama, in coordination with Anne Marie Tamburro.",
