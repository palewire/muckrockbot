Please click on the request link to download the responsive documents that have been made available to you.\r\n\r\nThe University produces the document responsive to PRR 1874-28.  Disciplinary complaints and investigations as well as Title IX and discrimination complaints and investigations of complaints involving employees, if any, are confidential personnel matters and are protected from public disclosure under the Board of Regents Handbook, the NSHE Code (including section 5.6.2) and the common law balancing test.  Donrey v. Bradshaw, 106 Nev. 630, 636, 798 P.2d 144 (1990). The NSHE Code has the force and effect of statute.  State ex rel. Richardson v. Board of Regents, 70 Nev. 144, 150 (1953).  To the extent such complaints and investigations, if any, involve students, they are confidential under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d), which deems education records of students to be confidential.  See 20 U.S.C. section 1232g(4) and 34 C.F.R. section 99.3 and NSHE BOR Handbook, Title 4, Chapter 1, Section 28.  Such records are also confidential under the common law balancing test.  Donrey v. Bradshaw, 106 Nev. 630, 636, 798 P.2d 144 (1990).  Pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. (NRS) 239.010, confidential or privileged records are exempt from public disclosure. UNR relies, in good faith, on this claim of confidentiality and therefore such records, if any, are not subject to production.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern:  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. \r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:  \r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)  \r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and  \r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).   \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.  \r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).  \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis\r\n\r\nJ.D.

The exemptions:\r\n\r\n1)User manuals, handbooks, or comparable instructional documents provided to the department by Fusus regarding the following Fusus products and services\r\n\r\nDenied5 ILCS 140/7(1)(a): Under FOIA, information that is protected from disclosure by state or federal law cannot be disclosed pursuant to FOIA. 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(a). Copyright material is protected under Section 106 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106) and, therefore, cannot be disclosed without authorization\r\n\r\n2) Audit logs/audit trails documenting each time a department account has accessed live or recorded video footage through the Fusus platforms from 1/1/2024 until the date this request is processed.\r\n\r\nAll months, except February will be made available. There is an open ticket with the vendor to troubleshoot why February data won't query. I was able to remove empty columns to have data print on one page. I also removed license plates under and IP addresses as 7 1(b), private information and 140/7(1)(d)(v) (v) disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other than those generally used and known or disclose internal documents of correctional agencies related to detection, observation, or investigation of incidents of crime or misconduct, and disclosure would result in demonstrable harm to the agency or public body that is the recipient of the request;\r\n\r\n3) Metadata for each Intelligent AI Alert generated by the department's Fusus system from 1/1/2024 until the date this request is processed. Fusus Intelligent AI Alerts automatically notify authorized users when Fusus AI-connected cameras detect pre-defined events (e.g. a fight) or profiles (e.g. a vehicle of interest). Please note that I am not requesting the video footage or any personally identifying information associated with the alert, but rather the metadata. Metadata may include, but is not limited to: the type of alert, the date and time of the alert, who received the alert, locations associated with the alert, and algorithmic confidence scores associated with the alert. This metadata should be stored in a database and so I ask that you provide it to me as a .csv, .xls, or other database filetype.\r\n\r\nItem number 3 will be denied applying the following exemptions: 140/7(1)(d)(v) (v) disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other than those generally used and known or disclose internal documents of correctional agencies related to detection, observation, or investigation of incidents of crime or misconduct, and disclosure would result in demonstrable harm to the agency or public body that is the recipient of the request;\r\n\r\n(vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel or any other person;\r\n\r\n(vii) obstruct an ongoing criminal investigation by the agency that is the recipient of the request.\r\n\r\n(d-7) Information gathered, or records created from the use of automatic license plate readers in connection with Section 2-130 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.\r\n\r\nI will email this to your email.

Maureen Schmidt, a FOIA Officer for the Village, is the official responsible for this denial.\r\n\r\nNotice of Right to Review by Illinois Attorney General. You have the right to file a request for review of your request and this Notice of Denial by the Public Access Counselor of the Office of the Illinois Attorney General.

This information is critical to my participation in the oversight and administration of this program.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I am requesting accommodations due to my condition. I respectfully request that all records be provided electronically via email, as opposed to portals or complex delivery methods, to ensure full and equal access to the information.\r\n\r\nScope of Request:\r\nLegislative Records:\r\n\r\nAll bills, amendments, resolutions, legislative proposals, and legislative history related to the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nVoting records of all state and federal legislators on any legislation affecting the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nMinutes, transcripts, and audio/video recordings of meetings, hearings, or discussions where the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program was a topic.\r\nPublic Records:\r\n\r\nComprehensive reports, studies, assessments, and evaluations on the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nBudget allocations, financial statements, expenditure reports, and audit results related to the program, pursuant to Connecticut Budget Transparency Laws (C.G.S. \u00a7 4-66 and related sections).\r\nAll contracts, agreements, memoranda of understanding, and intergovernmental agreements involving the administration or management of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nCorrespondence:\r\n\r\nAll emails, letters, and other forms of communication, including internal and external, regarding the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nInternal memoranda, briefing documents, policy directives, and decision-making correspondence related to the oversight and implementation of the program.\r\nPersonnel Records:\r\n\r\nNon-confidential employment records, including job descriptions, resumes, and performance evaluations, of individuals involved in the administration and oversight of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program. This request is consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a), which protects confidential personal data.\r\nOrganizational charts detailing the structure and personnel responsible for managing the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program within relevant state and federal agencies.\r\nProgram Information:\r\n\r\nAll guidelines, protocols, procedural documents, and compliance reviews governing the operation of the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, as mandated by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Regulations (42 CFR \u00a7 440.180) for home and community-based services waiver programs.\r\nImplementation plans, performance metrics, outcome reports, and evaluation summaries regarding the effectiveness of the program.\r\nComprehensive data sets related to enrollment, utilization, demographic information, and outcomes of beneficiaries participating in the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nSpecial Requests:\r\nExpedited Processing: Pursuant to Executive Order 13392, which mandates the improvement of agency disclosure processes, and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), I request expedited processing of this FOIA request due to the public interest and personal impact of the information.\r\n\r\nElectronic Records: In compliance with my rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, I request that all records be provided in electronic format and sent directly to my email address.

        "communication": "Comprehensive Appeal for FOIA Requests OPM ID #24-81 and OPM ID #24-84\r\nFrom: David Medeiros\r\nDate: November 20, 2024\r\nTo: Office of Policy and Management (OPM)\r\nCC: Listed State and Federal Agencies and Department Heads\r\n\r\nSubject: Appeal for Legal and Constitutional Compliance with FOIA Requests OPM ID #24-81 and OPM ID #24-84 and Enforcement of ADA Accommodations\r\nIntroduction\r\nThis appeal addresses significant deficiencies in the responses to FOIA requests OPM ID #24-81 and #24-84 regarding records for the Connecticut Medicaid Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) Waiver Program. As a Medicaid recipient and an advocate for individuals with disabilities, I rely on the transparency mandated by state and federal FOIA laws to ensure accountability and equitable program administration. This appeal also highlights persistent violations of statutory ADA accommodation requirements and constitutional protections.\r\n\r\nSummary of FOIA Requests\r\nI requested:\r\n\r\nLegislative Records:\r\nBills, amendments, legislative history, and meeting minutes related to the Medicaid ABI Waiver Program.\r\nPublic Records:\r\nFinancial statements, budget allocations, program assessments, contracts, and audits pursuant to Connecticut\u2019s transparency statutes (C.G.S. \u00a7 4-66).\r\nCorrespondence:\r\nInternal and external communication, directives, memoranda, and policies regarding the ABI Waiver Program.\r\nPersonnel Records:\r\nNon-confidential job descriptions, resumes, performance evaluations, and organizational charts related to program oversight and administration.\r\nProgram Information:\r\nProcedural documents, compliance reviews, demographic data, and performance outcomes required under federal CMS regulations (42 CFR \u00a7 440.180).\r\nPurpose:\r\nTo ensure compliance, transparency, and equitable administration of taxpayer-funded services critical to individuals with acquired brain injuries.\r\n\r\nLegal Framework and Basis for Appeal\r\nFederal and State FOIA Compliance\r\nFederal FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552):\r\nGuarantees access to federal records, mandates timely responses, and requires detailed explanations for delays or denials.\r\nConnecticut FOIA (C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 to 1-242):\r\nEnsures access to state-held records within four business days and prohibits unnecessary delays or redactions.\r\nMedicaid Statute (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.):\r\nMandates accountability in Medicaid programs, including state compliance with CMS requirements.\r\nExecutive Order 13392:\r\nDirects agencies to improve FOIA processing and transparency.\r\nADA and Section 504 Compliance\r\nADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.):\r\nProhibits discrimination and requires public entities to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\r\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794):\r\nGuarantees equal access to federally funded programs and public records.\r\nViolations and Deficiencies\r\n1. Non-Compliance with FOIA Timelines\r\nConnecticut Law (C.G.S. \u00a7 1-210):\r\nRequires confirmation of receipt and timeline estimates within four business days. OPM acknowledged receipt but failed to provide specific timelines for document production or updates on progress.\r\nFederal FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)):\r\nMandates prompt responses and proactive communication regarding delays. These requirements have not been met.\r\n2. Inadequate Acknowledgment of ADA Accommodations\r\nMy request explicitly outlined Non-Negotiable ADA Accommodations, which were ignored:\r\nEmail-only communication.\r\nScreen-reader-compatible PDF attachments.\r\nSimplified summaries for complex records.\r\nIdentification of responsible FOIA personnel.\r\nExpedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E).\r\nFailure to implement these accommodations violates both ADA Title II and Section 504, depriving me of equal access to the FOIA process.\r\n\r\n3. Unjustified Redactions and Potential Fee Assessments\r\nFee Waiver Denial:\r\nThe request meets public interest criteria under C.G.S. \u00a7 1-212(d) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). No statutory basis has been provided for proposed fees.\r\nFailure to Justify Redactions:\r\nFederal FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)) requires detailed explanations for exemptions, including statutory citations. These justifications have not been provided.\r\nNon-Negotiable ADA Accommodations (Updated)\r\nMuckRock Platform Only:\r\n\r\nAll responses must be sent through the MuckRock platform to ensure accessibility and compliance.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body:\r\n\r\nFull text of responses embedded in the email body to enhance readability and accessibility.\r\nScreen-Reader-Compatible PDFs:\r\n\r\nClearly labeled, properly formatted PDFs must accompany email responses.\r\nSimplified Summaries:\r\n\r\nProvide simplified explanations for technical, financial, or legal documents.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel:\r\n\r\nFull names, titles, and contact information for FOIA officers and supervisory personnel.\r\nDetailed Justifications for Denials:\r\n\r\nCite specific exemptions for any withheld or redacted information.\r\nExpedited Processing:\r\n\r\nRequests must be processed urgently, as mandated under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) and Executive Order 13392.\r\nConstitutional Violations\r\n1. First Amendment (Right to Petition the Government)\r\nThe refusal to provide timely and accessible information infringes upon my constitutional right to petition for redress of grievances.\r\n\r\n2. Fourteenth Amendment (Equal Protection Clause)\r\nDenial of ADA accommodations constitutes unequal treatment of individuals with disabilities, violating federal law and constitutional protections.\r\n\r\n3. Fifth Amendment (Due Process Clause)\r\nThe lack of transparency, failure to justify delays, and insufficient responses deprive me of my right to procedural due process.\r\n\r\n4. Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2)\r\nState practices inconsistent with federal FOIA and ADA standards violate the Supremacy Clause, which establishes the primacy of federal law.\r\n\r\nRequested Actions\r\nFull Compliance with FOIA Requests OPM ID #24-81 and #24-84:\r\n\r\nProvide all responsive documents promptly and in adherence to the updated accommodations.\r\nConfirmation of Accommodations:\r\n\r\nExplicit acknowledgment that all updated accommodations will be applied moving forward.\r\nJustifications for Redactions and Fees:\r\n\r\nProvide detailed statutory justifications for any redactions or fees.\r\nTimeline for Completion:\r\n\r\nSubmit a clear and reasonable timeline for fulfilling these requests.\r\nCC List for Transparency and Accountability\r\nState of Connecticut Agencies:\r\n\r\nConnecticut Department of Social Services (DSS): Dr. Deidre S. Gifford (foia.dss@ct.gov)\r\nConnecticut Office of the Attorney General: William Tong (attorney.general@ct.gov)\r\nConnecticut General Assembly (CGA): Senator Martin M. Looney (foia@cga.ct.gov)\r\nConnecticut Office of Policy and Management (OPM): Melissa McCaw (opm.foia@ct.gov)\r\nConnecticut Department of Public Health (DPH): Dr. Manisha Juthani (dph.foi@ct.gov)\r\nFederal Agencies:\r\n\r\nHHS: Xavier Becerra (HHS_FOIA@hhs.gov)\r\nCMS: Chiquita Brooks-LaSure (FOIA_Request@cms.hhs.gov)\r\nDOJ: Merrick B. Garland (foia.requests@usdoj.gov)\r\nHUD: Marcia L. Fudge (foiarequests@hud.gov)\r\nDOL: Julie Su (foiarequests@dol.gov)\r\nFTC: Alvaro M. Bedoya (FOIA@ftc.gov)\r\nConclusion\r\nFailure to address these violations and implement the requested actions will result in escalation to oversight bodies, including state and federal courts. Compliance with FOIA and ADA obligations is not optional and ensures equitable access for all citizens.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\nEmail: AabiWR@live.com\r\nAddress: 215 Mountain Street, Willimantic, CT 06226",

These deficiencies include violations of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and constitutional protections. Immediate corrective actions are required to uphold statutory and constitutional obligations.\r\n\r\nKey Issues\r\nNon-Compliance with FOIA Obligations\r\n\r\nFOIA requires timely responses, transparency, and justification for denials (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210). Neither request has been fulfilled, nor has a timeline been provided for completion.\r\nFailure to Provide ADA Accommodations\r\n\r\nMy explicit ADA accommodation requests, including email-only communication, screen-reader-compatible documents, and simplified summaries, have not been honored, violating ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.) and Section 504 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\nLack of Accountability\r\n\r\nYour office has not identified the FOIA officers or decision-makers responsible for processing these requests, contrary to transparency mandates.\r\nPotential Constitutional Violations\r\n\r\nFailure to comply with ADA and FOIA constitutes a violation of my First Amendment right to petition the government, my Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection, and my Fifth Amendment right to due process.\r\nUpdated and Specific Relief Sought\r\nImmediate Full Compliance\r\n\r\nProvide all requested records, including legislative, financial, correspondence, personnel, and program documentation.\r\nEnsure compliance with FOIA timelines by submitting all records or updates within five (5) business days.\r\nImplementation of ADA Accommodations\r\n\r\nRoute all communications exclusively through the MuckRock platform, as required for accessibility.\r\nProvide all records as screen-reader-compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed.\r\nInclude simplified summaries for complex financial, legal, or medical records.\r\nAccountability Measures\r\n\r\nIdentify FOIA officers and decision-makers, including their names, titles, and contact information.\r\nProvide detailed justifications for any redactions or denials, citing applicable statutory exemptions.\r\nExpedited Processing and Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nConfirm expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) due to the public interest and impact on vulnerable Medicaid beneficiaries.\r\nReaffirm my fee waiver request as this request is non-commercial and in the public interest.\r\nDetailed Timeline for Completion\r\n\r\nSubmit a clear and specific timeline for the production of all responsive records.\r\nLegal Framework Supporting This Appeal\r\nFOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 and Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210)\r\n\r\nRequires timely, transparent responses and prohibits unnecessary delays.\r\nADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.) and Section 504 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794)\r\n\r\nMandate reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, ensuring equitable access to public records.\r\nFirst Amendment\r\n\r\nProtects the right to petition the government for redress of grievances, including access to information.\r\nFourteenth Amendment\r\n\r\nGuarantees equal protection under the law, which includes equal access to public services for individuals with disabilities.\r\nFifth Amendment\r\n\r\nEnsures due process rights, which are infringed by delayed or inaccessible responses.\r\nConsequences of Continued Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with statutory and constitutional obligations will result in the following:\r\n\r\nAdministrative Complaints\r\n\r\nComplaints will be filed with the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, and the Office for Civil Rights.\r\nJudicial Action\r\n\r\nLegal remedies will be pursued under FOIA, ADA, and constitutional protections to enforce compliance.\r\nPublic Reporting\r\n\r\nNon-compliance will be reported to media outlets, advocacy organizations, and oversight committees to ensure public accountability.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis appeal is an opportunity for your office to rectify systemic failures and demonstrate a commitment to transparency, accountability, and accessibility. I expect a full response and compliance with the relief sought by December 17, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n39 Kings HWY STE C\r\nGales Ferry, CT 06335 \r\nDB.42.131.Inf.\r\nABI Resources https://www.ctbraininjury.com/blog/tags/db-42-131-inf https://x.com/ABIresources/status/1866212331279339765 https://www.youtube.com/@ABI.RESOURCES-CT-ABI-MFP-CARE/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=2\r\n\r\nCC:\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission\r\nU.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division\r\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services\r\nRelevant Congressional Oversight Committees",

Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\n\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\nRequired Action:\r\n\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\n\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\n\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\n\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions. Your actions will either affirm your agency\u2019s commitment to accountability or further evidence systemic disregard for these principles.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt and substantive response.\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nState of Connecticut Officials:\r\n\r\nGovernor Ned Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: State Capitol, 210 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nToll-Free: (800) 406-1527\r\nTDD: (860) 524-7397\r\nEmail: Contact Form\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/governor\r\n\r\nAttorney General William Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/ag\r\n\r\nCommissioner Andrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nOffice Address: 55 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, CT 06105\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/dss\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Suite 1100, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nToll-Free: 1-866-374-3617\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/foi\r\n\r\nFederal Officials and Agencies:\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Blumenthal\r\nTitle: U.S. Senator from Connecticut\r\nWashington D.C.

Accommodations Request\r\nThis request includes explicit ADA accommodations to address cognitive processing challenges resulting from my traumatic brain injury (TBI). These accommodations are legally required under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nRequested ADA Accommodations\r\nTo ensure accessibility and compliance with ADA standards (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I request the following accommodations for all communications and records:\r\n\r\nScreen-Reader Compatible Formats\r\n\r\nAll documents must be provided in properly labeled PDFs or plain-text files.\r\nEnsure that the documents are screen-reader compatible and retain clear, accessible formatting.\r\nExclusive MuckRock Platform Communication\r\n\r\nAll communications must occur exclusively via the MuckRock platform.\r\nDo not send external links, emails, portals, passwords, codes, or require phone calls for access.\r\nText Embedded in Email Bodies\r\n\r\nKey information must be embedded directly in the email body to facilitate comprehension and accessibility.\r\nSimplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide plain-language summaries for complex or legal documents to ensure clarity and understanding.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Officers\r\n\r\nInclude the full name, title, and contact information of all responsible officers handling this request.\r\nNon-Negotiable Compliance\r\n\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and are essential for ensuring equal access to information. Failure to provide the requested accommodations may constitute a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Thank you for ensuring compliance and accessibility in addressing this request.\r\n\r\nThe challenges we face today demand more than acknowledgment\u2014they require action, collaboration, and a unified commitment to solutions. Together, we must embrace transparency, accountability, and compassion as the foundation of our efforts. By fostering open communication, prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable, and holding systems accountable, we can rebuild trust and ensure equitable outcomes for all.\r\n\r\nSolutions lie in unity\u2014when state and federal leaders, advocates, and communities work hand in hand to uphold justice and fairness. Transparency through accessible Freedom of Information processes, adherence to legal mandates, and robust oversight are the pillars that support meaningful change. Each of us has a role to play in creating a system that serves and protects.\r\n\r\nOur collective mission is clear: to build bridges between agencies and communities, ensure the dignity of every individual, and honor the principles that guide us toward progress. Together, with determination and unity, we can overcome systemic failures and pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future.",

The documents provided fail to satisfy the scope of my request and do not comply with state and federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) obligations, as well as statutory ADA accommodation requirements.\r\n\r\nGrounds for Appeal\r\n1. Failure to Provide Complete Records\r\nThe records provided are insufficient and omit critical components of the request, including:\r\n\r\nLegislative Records: Bills, amendments, resolutions, legislative history, and voting records on the ABI Waiver Program were not included.\r\n\r\nPublic Records: Missing comprehensive financial records, including budget allocations, financial statements, and audits, required for program transparency.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence: Internal and external communications, including emails and directives related to the program, were not provided.\r\n\r\nPersonnel Records: Non-confidential employment records and organizational charts related to program administration were excluded.\r\n\r\nProgram Information: Enrollment data, performance metrics, and compliance reviews were not included.\r\n\r\n2. Failure to Provide Justifications for Redactions or Denials\r\nThe response lacks a Vaughn Index or detailed justifications for any omissions or redactions, as required by FOIA statutes (Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210 and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)).\r\n\r\n3. ADA Accommodations Request\r\nThis request includes explicit ADA accommodations to address cognitive processing challenges resulting from my traumatic brain injury (TBI). These accommodations are legally required under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nRequested ADA Accommodations\r\nTo ensure accessibility and compliance with ADA standards (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I request the following accommodations for all communications and records:\r\n\r\nScreen-Reader Compatible Formats\r\n\r\nAll documents must be provided in properly labeled PDFs or plain-text files.\r\nEnsure that the documents are screen-reader compatible and retain clear, accessible formatting.\r\n\r\nExclusive MuckRock Platform Communication\r\nAll communications must occur exclusively via the MuckRock platform.\r\nDo not send external links, emails, portals, passwords, codes, or require phone calls for access.\r\nText Embedded in Bodies\r\n\r\nKey information must be embedded directly in the  body to facilitate comprehension and accessibility.\r\nSimplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide plain-language summaries for complex or legal documents to ensure clarity and understanding.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Officers\r\n\r\n***** Include the full name, title, and contact information of all responsible officers handling this request. ****\r\n\r\nNon-Negotiable Compliance\r\n\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and are essential for ensuring equal access to information. Failure to provide the requested accommodations may constitute a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Thank you for ensuring compliance and accessibility in addressing this request.\r\n\r\nRelief Requested\r\nTo address the above deficiencies, I formally request the following actions:\r\n\r\n1. Complete Records Production\r\nProvide all requested records, including:\r\n\r\nLegislative history, voting records, and meeting minutes related to the ABI Waiver Program.\r\nComprehensive public records, including budget allocations, audits, and financial data.\r\nCorrespondence between the Department of Social Services (DSS), OPM, and external entities related to the program.\r\nPersonnel records, job descriptions, and organizational charts for staff overseeing the program.\r\nProgram information such as enrollment data, compliance reviews, and outcome reports.\r\n\r\n2. Detailed Justifications for Redactions or Denials\r\nSubmit a Vaughn Index or equivalent documentation detailing statutory exemptions for withheld or redacted records.\r\n\r\n3. ADA Compliance\r\nImmediately comply with ADA accommodations, including:\r\n\r\nADA Accommodations Request\r\nThis request includes explicit ADA accommodations to address cognitive processing challenges resulting from my traumatic brain injury (TBI). These accommodations are legally required under Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794).\r\n\r\nRequested ADA Accommodations\r\nTo ensure accessibility and compliance with ADA standards (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), I request the following accommodations for all communications and records:\r\n\r\nScreen-Reader Compatible Formats\r\n\r\nAll documents must be provided in properly labeled PDFs or plain-text files.\r\nEnsure that the documents are screen-reader compatible and retain clear, accessible formatting.\r\nExclusive MuckRock Platform Communication\r\n\r\nAll communications must occur exclusively via the MuckRock platform.\r\nDo not send external links, emails, portals, passwords, codes, or require phone calls for access.\r\nText Embedded in Email Bodies\r\n\r\nKey information must be embedded directly in the email body to facilitate comprehension and accessibility.\r\nSimplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide plain-language summaries for complex or legal documents to ensure clarity and understanding.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Officers\r\n\r\nInclude the full name, title, and contact information of all responsible officers handling this request.\r\n\r\nNon-Negotiable Compliance\r\nThese accommodations are non-negotiable and are essential for ensuring equal access to information. Failure to provide the requested accommodations may constitute a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Thank you for ensuring compliance and accessibility in addressing this request.\r\n\r\n4. Timeline for Completion\r\nProvide a clear timeline for fulfilling this appeal and any pending records requests.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis\r\nFOIA Compliance (Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nThe FOIA mandates timely, complete responses to public records requests. Any delays or incomplete responses must be accompanied by statutory justifications.\r\n\r\nADA Compliance (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794)\r\nPublic entities are required to provide reasonable accommodations to ensure equitable access to information for individuals with disabilities.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Protections\r\nFailure to comply with FOIA and ADA violates:\r\n\r\nFirst Amendment: Right to petition the government for redress of grievances.\r\nFourteenth Amendment: Equal protection under the law.\r\nFifth Amendment: Due process rights.\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to resolve this matter will result in escalation through the following avenues:\r\n\r\nAdministrative Complaints: Filing with the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission and the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division.\r\nJudicial Remedies: Pursuing litigation to compel compliance with FOIA and ADA obligations.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging transparency organizations and media outlets to highlight systemic non-compliance.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis appeal serves as an opportunity for OPM to correct these deficiencies and demonstrate a commitment to transparency, accountability, and accessibility. I expect a response within ten (10) business days outlining your corrective actions.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nOriginal FOIA Requests (OPM ID #24-81 and #24-84)\r\nDocuments Provided by OPM\r\nCC:\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission\r\nU.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division\r\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\nOffice of Government Information Services (OGIS)",

These failures directly impact whistleblower protections, Medicaid oversight, and public accountability.\r\n\r\nIssues to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Case Numbers and Records Management\r\n\r\nCase Numbers Requiring Investigation:\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121\r\n\r\n2. Anonymity and Lack of Accountability in Decision-Making\r\n\r\nUnsigned Determination Letters:\r\n\r\nMany determination letters from OSC lack identifiable signatures, names, or clear authorship.\r\n\r\nThis practice raises serious concerns about accountability and compliance with transparency laws.\r\n\r\n3. Suppressed or Altered Records\r\n\r\nEvidence suggests discrepancies between the whistleblower reports I submitted and how they were recorded or handled by OSC.\r\n\r\nSpecific issues include:\r\n\r\nAlterations or removal of content from submitted complaints.\r\n\r\nSuppression of reports that exposed systemic failures in Medicaid oversight and retaliation against whistleblowers.\r\n\r\n4. Lack of FOIA Compliance\r\n\r\nDespite repeated Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, OSC and related agencies have failed to provide:\r\n\r\nComplete case files and communication logs.\r\n\r\nJustification for withheld or redacted information.\r\n\r\nClear timelines for compliance.\r\n\r\nSpecific Questions to Investigate\r\n\r\n1. Who is Responsible for Managing These Records?\r\n\r\nIdentify the individuals, teams, or automated systems involved in creating, altering, and assigning these case numbers and reports.\r\n\r\n2. What Decisions Were Made and Why?\r\n\r\nDetermine how decisions were reached, why some reports were closed without action, and why letters were sent anonymously.\r\n\r\n3. Were There Violations of Federal Law?\r\n\r\nInvestigate potential obstruction of justice, retaliation, or misuse of authority under whistleblower protection laws and FOIA.\r\n\r\nKey Agencies and Officials Involved\r\n\r\nThis matter spans multiple federal and state agencies, including:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Department of Justice (DOJ)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Office of Inspector General (OIG)\r\n\r\nWhy This Matters\r\n\r\n1. Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nRetaliation against whistleblowers and suppression of reports undermine federal protections designed to safeguard transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\n2. Impact on Vulnerable Populations:\r\n\r\nThese failures harm Medicaid consumers, particularly those with disabilities, by allowing systemic mismanagement to persist unchecked.\r\n\r\n3. Misuse of Taxpayer Funds:\r\n\r\nLack of oversight and accountability results in waste and misuse of federal funds meant to serve the public.\r\n\r\nRequested Actions\r\n\r\n1. Investigate Record Management:\r\n\r\nAudit all OSC records, emails, and internal communications related to these case numbers.\r\n\r\nIdentify responsible individuals or systems.\r\n\r\n2. Subpoena Additional Evidence:\r\n\r\nSecure all suppressed or altered reports to ensure a complete and accurate investigation.\r\n\r\n3. Hold Accountable Those Involved in Misconduct:\r\n\r\nRecommend prosecution or disciplinary action for any individuals found to have violated federal laws.\r\n\r\n4. Ensure Compliance with FOIA and Whistleblower Protections:\r\n\r\nMandate OSC and related agencies to comply fully with FOIA requests and whistleblower laws.\r\n\r\nAttachments\r\n\r\nI have attached all available documentation, including:\r\n\r\nCorrespondence with OSC, including determination letters and emails.\r\n\r\nFOIA requests and responses (or lack thereof).\r\n\r\nDetailed reports submitted to OSC and other federal agencies.\r\n\r\nThis issue demands immediate attention to uphold the principles of transparency, accountability, and justice. I am available to provide additional information or documentation as needed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\n\r\n_______\r\nSubject: Final Assertion of Legal Obligations Under FOIA, ADA, and Constitutional Law\r\n\r\nSubject: 12/23/2024 Freedom of Information Act Request: OSC Cases DI-25-000310, DI-25-000325, DI-25-000379, DI-12192024714, and DI-12112024134; Associated FBI, DOJ, HHS, CMS, OAG, OIP , DOT and Medicaid Oversight Records FOIA (Federal Bureau of Investigation)\r\n01.08.2025\r\n\r\nTo all It May Concern in All Relevant Departments and Divisions,\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\n\r\nMichael G. Seidel\r\nSection Chief\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section\r\nInformation Management Division\r\nThis correspondence pertains to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Your handling of this matter raises critical concerns under FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132), and constitutional principles of government accountability.\r\n\r\nOSC Case Records\r\n\r\nComplete files, internal and external communications, investigations, and resolutions regarding:\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11252024342 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11272024158 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-11282024737 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12022024333 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12032024933 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12042024718 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12052024838 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12062024939 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12072024240 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12112024134 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-12202024300 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSCFiling-MedeirosDavid-DI-112620241121 .pdf\r\n\r\nOSC File No. DI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310\r\n\r\nDI-25-000325\r\n\r\nDI-25-000379\r\n\r\nDI-12192024714\r\n\r\nDI-12112024134\r\n\r\nAs recognized in National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), transparency is fundamental to democracy and public trust. Your agency\u2019s obligations are not discretionary, and failure to meet them constitutes a violation of statutory and constitutional law. This letter establishes your duties, addresses deficiencies, and anticipates and counters all potential deflection strategies.\r\n\r\n1. FOIA Obligations: Statutory Mandates and Required Actions\r\nFOIA establishes an enforceable right of access to federal agency records. Your response must meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\nA. Timeliness\r\nUnder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), you are required to provide a determination within 20 business days. Delays beyond this timeframe, absent legitimate extension requests, constitute a violation of FOIA.\r\nCountermeasure: Delays are actionable under Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. DOJ, 711 F.3d 180 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nRequired Action: Provide the requested records or a lawful determination.\r\n\r\nB. Adequacy of Search\r\nFOIA requires a thorough and reasonable search for records, as established in Campbell v. DOJ, 164 F.3d 20 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This includes:\r\nIdentifying the databases, locations, and terms used.\r\nProviding a sworn affidavit detailing the search scope.\r\nCountermeasure: A vague claim of \"no responsive records\" is insufficient without a detailed affidavit.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a sworn affidavit documenting the search or confirm the existence of responsive records.\r\n\r\nC. Proper Use of Exemptions\r\nExemptions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) must be narrowly applied and justified with specific explanations. Blanket or vague exemptions are impermissible.\r\nCountermeasure: A Vaughn index (Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973)) is required to justify each withholding.\r\nRequired Action: Submit a Vaughn index detailing each exemption and its justification within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nD. Decentralization and Referrals\r\nReferrals or decentralization excuses do not absolve your agency of its responsibility to provide a consolidated response. As held in McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1983), agencies must coordinate internally to ensure compliance.\r\nCountermeasure: Require assurance of continuity and coordination across divisions.\r\nRequired Action: Consolidate records from all relevant offices and provide a unified response.\r\n\r\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Compliance: Equal Access as a Legal Right\r\nAs a person with a documented disability, I am entitled to reasonable accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Your failure to provide accessible formats for requested records constitutes discrimination and violates federal law.\r\n\r\nCase Law:\r\nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004): Agencies must ensure meaningful access to government services.\r\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985): Denial of reasonable accommodations creates barriers that violate civil rights.\r\n\r\nRequired Action:\r\nProvide all requested records in accessible formats, including plain-language summaries or electronic files compatible with assistive technologies.\r\nConfirm compliance with ADA requirements by [specific date].\r\n\r\n3. Mandated Reporting and Whistleblower Protections\r\nYour handling of this request implicates broader concerns, including potential fraud, misuse of federal funds, or retaliation against whistleblowers. Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302), you are required to report and address systemic violations.\r\nCountermeasure: Reference Misprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4), which requires the reporting of observed violations of law.\r\nRequired Action: Document and escalate evidence of misconduct to oversight bodies, including the Office of Inspector General (OIG).\r\n\r\n4. Consequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with your statutory obligations knowingly constitutes violations of:\r\nObstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505): Delaying lawful access to records obstructs public accountability.\r\nCivil Rights Violations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983): Denying ADA accommodations constitutes a deprivation of federally protected rights.\r\nMisprision of Felony (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4): Concealing or failing to report observed violations is a criminal act.\r\nCountermeasure: Prepare for judicial review, oversight complaints, and public advocacy if compliance fails.\r\n\r\n5. Escalation Pathways\r\nIf your office does not comply within the specified timeframe, I will escalate this matter through:\r\nJudicial Review: Filing a lawsuit under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) to compel disclosure.\r\nOversight Complaints: Submitting formal complaints to OGIS, OIG, and the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Engaging investigative journalists, transparency advocates, and public interest organizations to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\n6. Final Statement: Upholding Transparency and Accountability\r\nThis matter reflects the public\u2019s right to transparency and the preservation of trust in government institutions. Your actions will either affirm your agency\u2019s commitment to accountability or further evidence systemic disregard for these principles.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt and substantive response.\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nState of Connecticut Officials:\r\n\r\nGovernor Ned Lamont\r\nTitle: Governor of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: State Capitol, 210 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-4840\r\nToll-Free: (800) 406-1527\r\nTDD: (860) 524-7397\r\nEmail: Contact Form\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/governor\r\n\r\nAttorney General William Tong\r\nTitle: Attorney General of Connecticut\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 808-5318\r\nEmail: attorney.general@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/ag\r\n\r\nCommissioner Andrea Barton Reeves\r\nTitle: Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\nOffice Address: 55 Farmington Avenue, Hartford, CT 06105\r\nPhone: (860) 424-5053\r\nEmail: andrea.bartonreeves@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/dss\r\n\r\nConnecticut Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC)\r\nOffice Address: 165 Capitol Avenue, Suite 1100, Hartford, CT 06106\r\nPhone: (860) 566-5682\r\nToll-Free: 1-866-374-3617\r\nEmail: foi@ct.gov\r\nWebsite: https://portal.ct.gov/foi\r\n\r\nFederal Officials and Agencies:\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Blumenthal\r\nTitle: U.S. Senator from Connecticut\r\nWashington D.C.

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

The office will provide an estimate of the time required to respond to the request, and may provide an estimate of copying costs pursuant to a specific request seeking an estimate of cost. If the requestor believes the amount of time or estimated costs stated are not reasonable, the requestor may petition the public records officer for a formal review under WAC 44-06-120.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.",

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

We are not sure what you meant by \"realted\". Did you mean \"related\"? Please know the term \"related\" is inexact and often requires clarification. The Washington State's Attorney General\u2019s Public Records Act Model Rules suggest that the agency should seek clarification from the requestor. The Model Rules also provide that the agency may interpret the request to be for records which directly and fairly discuss the topic. \r\n  \r\n As you may understand, the interpretation of what a record \u201crelating\" to a subject can vary from person to person. To ensure the search is both accurate and efficient, we seek to clarify your request. At this time, we interpret this portion of your request as seeking copies of payments made by requestors to obtain the responsive records released as response to their public record request(s) made in the 2024 calendar year. It is currently unknown if payments were made in the 2024 calendar year for public record requests regardless of what year the request was made and we will search for and provide those too, should they exist. If any of this interpretation is not accurate, please let us know within 30 days. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Your request to know the total feeTotal fees will be ascertained once all the responsive records have been compiled for this request. At this stage, we have gathered records together that will require a fee of $3.50 to be paid. Once the installment has been reviewed and redactions applied, we will then inform you what the fee will be for the records. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Washington State Public Records Act RCW 42.56, and more specifically RCW 42.56.520 recognizes that additional time to respond to a request is allowed when needed to clarify the intent of the request, to determine if any of the information requested is exempt, to notify third parties affected by the request, or to locate and assemble the information requested. The District anticipates being able to release records responsive to your public record request on or before February 5, 2025. If we are able to provide the records to you sooner, we will do so. If you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request please let us know. \r\n  \n Sincerely, \r\n  \r\n Spokane Public Schools\r\n200 N. Bernard\r\nSpokane, Washington 99201",

The charge for the records is $3.75. The records may be paid for at the cashier\u2019s desk on the second floor of the Administration building. Or, if you prefer, you may make a check or money order payable to Spokane Public Schools in the amount of $3.75. Once payment has been received by the Administration Cashiers, your requested records will be made available to you. Please indicate on the check that the payment is for your public records request and mail your payment to Spokane Public Schools, Administration Building, 200 North Bernard Street, Spokane, WA 99201 Attn: Public Records Office. \r\n  \r\n Please note, under Public Records law, a requestor must claim or review assembled records within thirty days of the agency\u2019s notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. If the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, the agency may close the request and re-file the assembled records. \r\n  \r\n Please also note that some records have been redated with a black text block that include white writing of an exemption key code (01-24) over the protected word or words. You will see the Redaction Exemption Key added to the last page of each record that was redacted. You will know which record has been redacted as the word \"Redacted\" has been added to the end of the title of the released record. Student names and identifying information is protected from release and has been redacted under 20 USC Sect. 1232g; RCW 42.56.230(2)(a)(iii). RCW 42.56.230(5) Credit card numbers and bank account numbers are exempt from disclosure and have been redacted from these records. \r\n  \r\n The District has provided copies of legal invoices, purchase orders of technology and supplies used for public record requests, and amount that requestors paid for their public record requests, also provided salary and benefits of staff that work on public record requests. This concludes the District\u2019s response to this request as the District considers this request to be fulfilled and closed. The Public Records Act\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of the District\u2019s response and records produced has started to run because the District does not intend to further address this request. The one year statute of limitations means you have one year to challenge the District\u2019s response and responsive records released to you. \r\n  \r\n If you have follow up questions about this request, please ask within the next 30 days. Please let us know if you believe additional responsive records have not been provided or if we have misunderstood or misinterpreted your request. If you are no longer seeking responsive records to this request please also let us know. \r\n  \n Sincerely, \r\n  \r\n Spokane Public Schools\r\n200 N. Bernard\r\nSpokane, Washington 99201",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:  \r\n  \r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. \r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n  \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):  \r\n  \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:  \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\nc. Charge (or charges)  \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and  \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.  \r\n  \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\n  \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\n  \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.  \r\n  \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).   \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d  \r\n  \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.  \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).  \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.  \r\n  \r\nSincerely,  \r\nMakayla Connor\r\nJ.D. Candidate \r\nResearch Assistant \r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration  \r\nconnor.mak@northeastern.edu \r\n(508) 340-1740\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMakayla Connor",

It further seeks records held by federal oversight agencies on related actions, communications, and decisions.\r\n\r\nPurpose of Request\r\nThis request seeks complete, unredacted records to establish evidence of:\r\n\r\nRetaliatory Actions: Impacts on ABI Resources, including Medicaid billing restrictions, program changes, and ticket closures.\r\nADA Non-Compliance: Documenting any failures by DSS, CMS, and associated entities in providing accessible communication for David Medeiros.\r\nFOIA Procedural Violations: Highlighting instances of partial responses and unsupported denials of relevant records.\r\nScope of Records Sought\r\nThe records requested cover December 1, 2023, to present. This scope includes, but is not limited to, emails, text messages, digital communications, internal memoranda, directives, meeting notes, attachments, drafts, and related working documents across all relevant departments, divisions, or offices.\r\n\r\n1. Medicaid Billing Suspension and Sandata EVV Ticket #539494 (CMS and DSS)\r\nComprehensive Communications and Directives: Full records (emails, memos, reports, directives, attachments, text messages) from DSS, CMS, and Sandata Technologies concerning Medicaid billing privileges for ABI Resources, LLC, including names and roles of those involved in discussions and approvals.\r\n\r\nComplete Documentation of Sandata EVV Ticket #539494: All records associated with Ticket #539494, including:\r\n\r\nInitial ticket details, problem descriptions, resolution requests, and follow-ups.\r\nCommunications detailing each stage of the ticket\u2019s handling, the reason for marking it \u201cresolved,\u201d and personnel involved in closing it.\r\n2. Retaliatory Actions Following December 18, 2023, Whistleblower Report (DSS, CMS, DOJ, OSC)\r\nInternal and External Correspondence: All records, including emails, directives, text messages, memos, and meeting notes, discussing the whistleblower report filed on December 18, 2023, including responses, assessments, and any retaliatory actions considered or taken against ABI Resources.\r\n\r\nDocumentation of Investigative Actions: All documentation related to any investigations launched in response to the whistleblower complaint, identifying personnel involved, findings, and any recommendations or disciplinary actions.\r\n\r\n3. ADA Compliance Documentation and Accommodation Requests (OCR, DOJ, DSS, CMS)\r\nADA Accommodation Requests: All records concerning ADA accommodations requested by David Medeiros and ABI Resources, with full documentation of responses, denials, and any internal discussions on ADA compliance obligations.\r\n\r\nADA Compliance Policies and Internal Guidelines: Copies of internal policies, training materials, and guidelines used by DSS and CMS related to ADA compliance, particularly on communication accessibility and auxiliary aids for individuals with disabilities.\r\n\r\n4. Records on Program Changes Impacting ABI Resources (DSS, CMS)\r\nCompanion Authorizations Termination Records: All communications, policy documents, and assessments on the termination of companion authorizations for the ABI Waiver Program as of December 31, 2023, including any correspondence between DSS, CMS, and Sandata Technologies related to this decision.\r\n5. Documentation of Specific Individuals\u2019 Involvement (All Relevant Agencies)\r\nRecords Involving Named Personnel:\r\nAndrea Barton Reeves, Commissioner, DSS\r\nMatthew S. Antonetti, Legal Director, DSS\r\nAstread Ferron-Poole, DSS Associate\r\nMichelle A. James and Emmett Nicholson, CMS officials overseeing Medicaid compliance\r\nAll communications, directives, notes, meeting minutes, or any form of correspondence or records involving the above-named individuals with respect to ABI Resources, LLC, particularly regarding Medicaid billing restrictions, ADA accommodation requests, and actions following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for FOIA Request and Compliance Mandates\r\n1. FOIA Compliance (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA mandates timely responses, full disclosure of non-exempt records, and explicit justifications for any redactions or denials. Any failure by DSS, CMS, or other federal agencies to meet these statutory requirements will constitute non-compliance. All denials must include precise statutory citations under FOIA, and records must be provided in their entirety unless exemptions are clearly and legally justified.\r\n\r\n2. ADA Compliance Obligations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160)\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA, public entities must ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. This includes providing accessible documents in screen-reader-compatible formats and meeting specific requests for auxiliary aids. DSS and CMS\u2019s failure to meet these requests for ADA accommodations in communications constitutes non-compliance under federal ADA statutes.\r\n\r\n3. Federal Whistleblower Protection Standards\r\nWhistleblower protections prohibit retaliation against individuals who report agency misconduct. The actions taken against ABI Resources and David Medeiros, including billing suspension, premature ticket resolution, and operational disruptions following his whistleblower report, are viewed as retaliatory actions that must be substantiated and documented by all relevant agencies.\r\n\r\nSpecific Demands for Compliance\r\nTo ensure adherence to FOIA and ADA mandates, and to facilitate the transparency required by federal and state law, I formally request:\r\n\r\nDelivery of ADA-Compliant Records in Full:\r\n\r\nEmail-Only Communication via MuckRock Platform: All responses, updates, and records must be sent exclusively via email to eliminate accessibility barriers. CMS must refrain from using phone calls, physical mail, or portal-based responses.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body: Embed response text directly in the email body for immediate readability and accessibility.\r\nPDF Attachments for Documents: All records should be provided as clearly labeled PDF attachments, organized by date and document type, with original formatting preserved for clarity and navigability.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel: Each response must include names, titles, and contact information of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisory personnel responsible for processing my request, ensuring transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDetailed Justifications for Redactions and Denials: Any information withheld or redacted must include detailed explanations citing specific statutory exemptions, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). These explanations must include enough detail to verify the legal basis for each exemption claimed.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing of FOIA Request\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), I formally request expedited processing of this FOIA request. This demand is based on critical statutory factors, including significant public interest, imminent risks to the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the need for urgent transparency to prevent ongoing retaliatory actions by public agencies.\r\n\r\nFailure to grant expedited processing within the statutory 10-day review period will constitute non-compliance with FOIA\u2019s provisions, necessitating formal escalation of this request to administrative or legal authorities.\r\n\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to respond to this FOIA request in full compliance, or any delays without proper statutory explanation, may result in formal escalation through administrative, legal, or public channels. DSS, CMS, and other involved agencies are expected to adhere strictly to statutory timelines, ensuring transparency and adherence to ADA and FOIA standards. Non-compliance will be documented and pursued through all available legal remedies.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis FOIA request seeks full and unambiguous access to records necessary to verify and substantiate claims of retaliation, ADA non-compliance, and procedural violations following the December 18, 2023, whistleblower report. I expect each agency to adhere strictly to both FOIA and ADA standards, ensuring prompt and thorough disclosure of all relevant documentation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources, LLC\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

        "communication": "12.04.2024 Subject: Appeal Immediate Compliance Required with ADA Accommodations and FOIA Obligations\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer\r\nI am writing to formally reiterate my request for specific ADA accommodations and compliance with FOIA obligations, which are essential for my full participation in this process. These accommodations were explicitly requested to address accessibility needs stemming from my traumatic brain injury and to ensure compliance with federal law. To date, your office has failed to meet these requirements, resulting in undue barriers and systemic non-compliance.\r\n\r\nAccommodations Previously Requested\r\nThe following accommodations, explicitly outlined in prior communications, remain unfulfilled:\r\n\r\nExclusive Use of MuckRock Platform\r\n\r\nRequested: All communications must be routed exclusively through the MuckRock platform. No external portals, password-protected links, or alternate communication methods are acceptable.\r\nNon-Compliance: Communications have directed me to use external portals and password-protected links, violating ADA guidelines and my explicit requests.\r\nAccessible Document Formatting\r\n\r\nRequested: All documents must be provided as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed for ease of navigation and accessibility.\r\nNon-Compliance: Provided documents have not adhered to accessibility standards, preventing effective access to critical information.\r\nSimplified Summaries for Complex Records\r\n\r\nRequested: Simplified summaries must accompany all complex or technical records to enhance comprehension and ensure equitable participation.\r\nNon-Compliance: No summaries have been provided, creating unnecessary barriers to understanding the records.\r\nIdentification of Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nRequested: Each communication must include the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for processing or responding to my requests.\r\nNon-Compliance: Correspondence has consistently lacked this information, hindering accountability and effective follow-up.\r\n\r\nImmediate Action Required\r\nTo rectify these ongoing failures and ensure compliance with federal laws, I demand the following actions be taken without delay:\r\n\r\nTransition All Communications to MuckRock\r\n\r\nImmediately cease the use of external portals or non-compliant communication methods and ensure all responses are routed exclusively through the MuckRock platform.\r\nProvide Accessible Documents\r\n\r\nReformat and resend all previously provided documents as screen-reader compatible PDFs, properly labeled and indexed to ensure accessibility.\r\nInclude Simplified Summaries\r\n\r\nProvide simplified summaries for all complex or technical records, both previously shared and in future communications, to ensure accessibility and equitable participation.\r\nIdentify Responsible Personnel\r\n\r\nInclude the name, title, and role of the individual responsible for every communication moving forward to ensure transparency and accountability.\r\nLegal Basis for Compliance\r\nYour office is legally obligated to comply with these accommodations under the following statutes and principles:\r\n\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA): Title II, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act mandate reasonable accommodations and accessibility in communications for individuals with disabilities.\r\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA): 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 requires transparency, accessibility, and adherence to procedural fairness.\r\nConstitutional Protections: The First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution safeguard my rights to petition the government, due process, and equal protection under the law.\r\nExecutive Order 13392: Mandates improved agency disclosure of information to enhance transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDeadline for Compliance\r\nYour office must confirm compliance with these accommodations and provide the requested corrective actions within five (5) business days of this notice. Continued non-compliance will be documented as a violation of the ADA and FOIA and may result in escalation, including:\r\n\r\nFormal Complaints: Filing with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office for Civil Rights.\r\nJudicial Remedies: Seeking injunctive relief and damages for ADA and FOIA violations.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Reporting systemic failures to oversight agencies, media, and advocacy organizations.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis communication serves as a final request for compliance. It is imperative that your office address these deficiencies promptly to restore transparency, accessibility, and adherence to federal law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and resolution by the stated deadline.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nDB.42.131.Inf.\r\n\r\nCC\r\nFederal Officials\r\nMerrick B.
