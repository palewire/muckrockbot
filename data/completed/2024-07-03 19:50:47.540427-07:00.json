I also do NOT have to go to the District Clerk, I can put it into the hand of the foreperson.\r\n\r\nYou are acting rather guilty and I am not the only one that has noticed this. \r\n\r\nThere is LAW and it's not on your side.

Scared?\r\nThere are \"pings\" from the radio locating the car Crawley was using, oops, you forgot? The radio checks will show where his location was.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there are no body cams, in the opinion of OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES is also proof of Parnell NOT Wanting people to know where people were, hence, Crawley and his Sheriff's dept. car.\r\n\r\nHello?\r\n\r\nI am asking for the name of the Grand Jury foreperson.\r\nYour b.s.

Get real.\r\nThat Josh Tetens was told by me in front of witnesses who heard me, and him at the Republican Club WITH Brittany Lannen, at that time she was waiting to sign a contract to represent the Crawleys and was AT the Republican Club with me and others rather upset at the entire situation. Tetens was given the opportunity to talk to her and he said he didn't need to because he believed her. \r\n\r\nThat I want and am forced to go to the Grand Jury Foreperson myself is a travesty in itself and you know it. \r\n\r\nTetens has had phone calls from other people who wanted to tell him what happened and he does not even call them back.\r\n\r\nI have emails and texts between myself and this DA and now I am satisfied that THIS is a travesty. I along with many, many others have been to the Federal authorities about this because YOU people simply don't care. However, you have law licenses and I have proof.\r\n\r\nI feel quite sure that you, Mr. Chapman would indeed rather have your head in the sand, it's oh, so much nicer, however, there is proof, witnesses and people who will not lie.\r\n\r\nThis has been going on since February the sixth and I, am quite tired of playing little games with you \"boys\" I have statements, texts, and on the other hand, your incompetence and total lack of \"curiosity\" about the matter. i suspect you talked to ole Par and he assured you I was crazy, well, let's see how this plays out. Remember you all KNOW about this so you're all culpable because of your knowledge and failure as officers of the court to do anything.\r\n\r\nLet's stop and think how my Complaint against not getting the name of the Grand Jury Foreperson along with this story plus evidence is going to play at the AG's office, then they too will  have the knowledge of a crime .....\r\n\r\nYour DA won't take this to the Grand Jury or even return calls from people who were there. The taxpayers paid 150K for this, Crawley himself is willing to tell any of you that call him and yet you don't. He told ME. \r\n\r\nSo you non curious good old boys just transfer what needs to go to what department and play your game. \r\nI have evidence and truth on my side.\r\nLet's play.\r\nI have 60K read me every day which equates to 47% of the voting public and that was BEFORE Parnell and Charlotte and the County yellow tape at the old mansion debaucle.\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with you?\r\nTruly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations.

This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request. For clarity, it is not the date the agency first created the record. \r\nThe following item(s) also apply to your request: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tApproximately zero pages were withheld in their entirety. \r\n\u2022\tFees: In the processing of this FOIA request, no fees are being assessed. \r\n\u2022\tOther: \r\n\r\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 90 K St, NE MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2024-059971 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Daniel Ellsberg. Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

I see that in the reply that contains these previously released documents, additional records that are responsive to my request exist. I am writing to confirm within the allotted thirty day window that this material does not satisfy my request as most of the documents are more than forty years old, and many are much older. I understand that Dr. Daniel Ellsberg continued to be of interest to the FBI long after the early 1980s. I request that the additional records about my requested subject be processed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in this matter.",

Provide a list or records regarding all grievance settlements including settlement amounts, union, date grievance filed, school (if applicable), date grievance settled, and contract issues of grievance from January 1, 2024 to current. RESPONSE: The CPS FOIA Office conducted a search with the Law Office and there are no responsive documents as per your request. \r\n2. Provide a list or records regarding all grievances in arbitration including union, date grievance filed, date arbitration started, school (if applicable) and contract issues of grievance from January 1, 2024 to current. \r\nRESPONSE : The CPS FOIA office reviewed your request and has determined that it is categorical in nature as it does not reasonably identify a document for search, and the collection of this information would require the District to create records. Specifically, the CPS does not comprehensively track the requested information in the manner requested, in the normal course of business. As such fulfilling this request would be considered creating records which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. Specifically, in order to comply with your request, each and every file would have to be pulled and all the portions of information you have requested would have to be searched for. Essentially, a new record would have to be created. This process is not required according to guidance provided by 5 ILCS 140/2(c). 5 ILCS 140/1, Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28, 32 (4 th Dist. 1989), and Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Additionally, under Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Further, Section 1\u00a0of the\u00a0FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part\u00a0of\u00a0any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\"\u00a0In accordance with Section 1\u00a0of\u00a0Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions or prepare researched records in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. \r\n3. Provide a total list of all grievances filed including union, date grievance filed, school (if applicable) and contract issues of grievance from January 1, 2024 to current. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records.\u00a0The records provided include all grievances received by the Office of Administrative Hearings only. As to the remainder of all other potentially responsive data, the CPS FOIA office has determined that it is categorical in nature as it does not reasonably identify a document for search, and the collection of this information would require the District to create records. Specifically, the CPS does not comprehensively track the requested information in the manner requested, in the normal course of business. As such fulfilling this request would be considered creating records which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. Specifically, in order to comply with your request, each and every file would have to be pulled and all the portions of information you have requested would have to be searched for.

Additionally, under Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Further, Section 1\u00a0of the\u00a0FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part\u00a0of\u00a0any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\"\u00a0In accordance with Section 1\u00a0of\u00a0Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions or prepare researched records in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706. You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court, 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. \r\nThank you for your request. Sincerely, \r\nAna Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2023 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2023.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2023 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n*** FORWARD THIS PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST TO PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICER ***\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

With racial equity as a central component of safety and security planning, it is imperative that all school safety and security staff not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.\"\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2. Provide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3. Provide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nNote: If your agency chooses not to produce the requested records in reverse chronological order as requested, and/or chooses to sandbag this request by dribbling out a few records per installment every 6 months (tee-hee), you can expect a separate targeted public records request for each line item by year - submitted via multiple members of the public, multiple times until the requested records are timely produced. This simple three part multi year request would then become twelve (12) separate public records requests. If your agency would prefer 12 separate individual requests, please let us know.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

This public records request is *NOT* for individual email files or records.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR \"Reasonably translatable\" electronic records - WAC 44-14-05002(2)(b)\r\n\r\nThis data export request is for the simple database export of five (5) \u201c@fwps.org\u201d datasets from the commercially available format your agency employs to the freely available commercial format Microsoft .pst. This request is for \"Reasonably translatable\" electronic records - WAC 44-14-05002(2)(b). Your agency stores these electronic records in a generally commercially available format. This request is for a database EXPORT FUNCTION of the (5) datasets identified in this request to the NATIVE .pst file format. No translation into another format is necessary as the .pst file format is the generally commercially available format of the record I am requesting. WAC 44-14-05002(2)(c)(ii).\r\n\r\nFurther, if your agency has a need to redact these records and claim various exemptions, any redaction process in no way obstructs your agency from providing the final .pst file as requested, with redactions, coupled with contemporaneous exemption logs as required by RCW RCW 42.56.210.\r\n\r\nThis request does not require specialized programming, the .pst file format is in regular use by your agency for regular day-today business operations. The process of export to .pst for this data requires less than a half dozen mouse clicks. As such, no customized service charge is applicable. If your agency claims the need for a customized service charge, provide a detailed explanation of the service charge, including why it applies, a description of the specific expertise required, and a reasonable estimate of the cost of the charge (WAC 44-14-05004.)\r\n\r\nFEES FOR REDACTION ARE NOT APPLICABLE\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56. 120 (2)(e). An agency cannot charge a \"redaction fee\" for the staff time necessary to prepare the records for inspection, for the copying required to redact records before they are inspected, or an archive fee for getting the records from off-site.\r\n\r\nDATE RANGE\r\nThe date range for this request is January 1, 2020 to April 29, 2024.\r\n\r\nUSE OF PORTAL NOT MANDATORY\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, in this request the MICROSOFT .pst file format. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip or digital compression in each installment for the fewest number of total records and the most economical calculation of any applicable public records fees.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\nPlease provide all electronic records in their native electronic format. Please do not create new records by printing native electronic files then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints for electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

(https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/) \r\nProvisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations. By submitting your request, you have agreed to pay up to $25.00 in applicable processing fees, if any fees associated with your request exceed this amount, CBP shall contact you; however, the first 100 pages are free.

        "communication": "Your request for Fee Waiver for the FOIA request CBP-2019-079982 has been fully granted.\r\n  \r\n* Fee Waiver Original Justification:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously \r\nwritten about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 \r\nreaders in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, \r\nUnicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable \r\nexpectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In \r\naddition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through \r\nnon-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, \r\ndisseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great \r\ndeal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. \r\nAs such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular \r\nsubject in advance. \r\nFurther, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information \r\nto a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of \r\nJustice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F. \r\n3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also \r\nhad \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States \r\nforeign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of \r\nthe news media. \r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the \r\nrequester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a \r\nrepresentative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for \r\nexample, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is \r\nin the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the \r\nrequest itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. \r\nI request that fees be waived. \r\n  * Fee Waiver Disposition Reason:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tN/A",

CBP follows the Office of Information Policy's guidance on the use of still-interested letters.  The guidance can be found on the internet at the following link: https://www.justice.gov/oip/limitations-use-still-interested-inquiries \nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account], mailing a letter to 90 K St, NE MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \n\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \n\nPlease notate file number CBP-2019-079982 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \n\nSincerely, \n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\n",

The case is still in our complex backlog queue, pending assignment to a first level review.  Please be advised that each case must go through two levels of review before a release determination can be made.  Given the volume of our backlog and the fluctuation of queue placement due to consults from other agencies that predate your request, it's likely that your case may not be assigned to a first level review within the next 12 months.  At this time, the estimated completion date is approximately 3-4 years.  \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your patience thus far.\nRegards,\r\nCindy B \r\nNSA/CSS FOIA Requester Service Center\r\n(301)688-6527",

Our complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 181 days from the date of receipt for processing.

        "communication": "Good morning Mr. Best,\r\n\r\nReference is made to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request 1360313-0 for FBI records concerning John Francis Good.  The FBI has located approximately 1,782 pages that are potentially responsive to your request.  Once requests go over a certain size, usually in the 50-100 page range, they become increasingly complex, greatly slowing down the time required for processing.  Generally the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may be a very long time before you would begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nWe contact requesters with requests of this size to see if there might be a way to possibly narrow the scope.  Is this something you might be willing to consider?  If so, please contact me and we can discuss this possibility.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\nLeslie Wilson\r\n540-868-4894\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nNegotiation/RIDS/RMD\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation",

Sorry for my not being informed of the name change.\r\n\r\nWith regards to this FOIA on John Good, one main file and two reference serials were located on this subject.  The main file does consist of 5 sections with approximately 1,777 pages covering Mr. Good's career.  If you do want this request to be processed from the medium track queue with current estimated time for processing at about 7 months, the first two sections can be processed in whole and the 3rd section partial processing up to the 949 threshold for page count.  For this reduced scope, upon completion of all materials (an interim CD release should be received in about 3 to 4 months), you can place another FOIA request, citing this one, and ask for additional materials to be processed from this case.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you are interested in this.  I do appreciate your consideration and patience.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLeslie Wilson",

        "communication": "Good Morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning file number 72-HQ-2190.  The FBI located approximately 1,374 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size.\r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.\r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  The current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 57 months.\r\n\r\nGiven the current COVID-19 pandemic and federal guidelines to mitigate the spread of the virus, the FBI's Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) is operating with limited staff on a staggered schedule to protect the safety of its employees, families and communities.  As a result, estimated dates of completion for Freedom of Information Act requests were impacted and you can expect lengthened response timelines.  Please note that these are estimates, and these timelines may change as this national emergency evolves.  The FBI remains committed to fulfilling your FOIPA request in the timeliest manner possible.   Thank you for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of all tracks and the average time approximately to complete each.  Hopefully this breakdown will be helpful to you in reducing the scope of this request.\r\nSimple track request (0- 50 pages) current average time is approximately 4 months to complete.\r\nMedium track request (51-950 pages) current average time is approximately 27 months to complete.\r\nLarge track request (951-8000 pages) current average time is approximately 57 months to complete.\r\nX-Large track request (over 8000 pages) current average time is approximately 70 months to complete.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>.

As of October 1, 2023, we have 373 open requests and over 1,407,542 pages of records waiting to be reviewed, analyzed, redacted, and released. As such, our office must balance the competing needs of many requesters. Some request small numbers of records that are easy to review and analyze. Others request large numbers of records or records that are complex and require a longer time to review.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of fairness, we make every effort to respond to requests in the order received. Therefore, we will proceed in processing your requests in the same manner, responding to the oldest before moving on to your next subsequent request. However as a one-time exception, if you would like to re-prioritize your requests, please email our office by October 20, 2023. If we do not hear from you by that date, our office will continue processing your requests in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact our office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan Adams\r\nCompliance Analyst\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON\r\nOffice of Public Records and Open Public Meetings\r\nMail: Roosevelt Commons-Box 354997, Seattle, WA 98195\r\nStreet: 4311 11th Ave NE, #360\n",
