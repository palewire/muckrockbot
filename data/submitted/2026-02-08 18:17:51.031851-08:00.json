Notice content and location\r\n\u2022\tThe specific notice(s), webpage(s), posting(s), or written materials the University relies on to \u201csummarize the provisions\u201d of ORS 659A.270\u2013659A.285, as required by ORS 659A.279;\r\n\u2022\tWhere those notices are posted or maintained, including physical locations and URLs;\r\n\u2022\tThe date each notice or posting went into effect and any revisions made since 2019.\r\n\r\n2. Procedures available to employees\r\n\u2022\tAny written procedures, guidance, or internal instructions explaining how an employee invokes the statutory protection with the University;\r\n\u2022\tIdentification of the office(s) responsible for administering the protection;\r\n\u2022\tPolicies or guidance explaining how the protection functions when Paid Leave Oregon benefits are unavailable, exhausted, or not applicable;\r\n\u2022\tAny materials intended to allow employees to plan around the protection, including timing, documentation, duration, and job-protection effects.\r\n\r\n3. Transition and change records (2019\u20132026)\r\n\u2022\tRecords documenting the transition from earlier certification forms and processes in use in or around 2019 to later versions used in 2026;\r\n\u2022\tAny drafts, approvals, internal communications, or decision-making records associated with revising or replacing those forms or procedures;\r\n\u2022\tRecords reflecting how the University evaluated whether revised forms, postings, or procedures continued to comply with ORS 659A.279 following the implementation of Paid Leave Oregon;\r\n\u2022\tAny records addressing how employees were notified of changes in forms, routing, or administration.\r\n\u2022\tAny written policies, procedures, workflows, routing instructions, or standard operating procedures used by Human Resources, HR Leaves, or other offices when an employee requests safety-related leave and Paid Leave Oregon benefits are unavailable or exhausted, including records addressing whether and how the employee is routed to University-administered unpaid leave or the 160-hour public-employer leave bank.\r\n\r\nIf the University contends that no responsive records exist for any portion of this request, please confirm that position in writing.\r\n\r\nClarification regarding parallel processes:\r\n\r\nTo avoid any confusion, this public records request is submitted pursuant to Oregon Public Records Law only and does not waive, replace, or otherwise affect any requests, grievances, or RFIs I have submitted through my union or any other employment-related process, many of which remain pending.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted because I require timely access to records necessary to understand my statutory protections and to plan accordingly. The public records process is the only mechanism currently available to obtain this information within a reasonable timeframe.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKelvin Shivers II",

FILING AND AUDIT TRAIL RECORDS All records, including emails, internal memos, or \"Records Disposal Authorizations\" (Form RC-075), that document the date this document was placed into the physical folder of the Health Department.\r\n\r\n5. All communications with the Connecticut Health Department in connection with the above referenced documents and Hat City Ale House from May 2018 to the present.\r\n\r\n6. All copies of the above referenced documents in possession of Sean Hearty, both as Permit Center Director/Coordinator and Zoning Enforcement Officer, Danbury Planning and zoning.\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirement: I am specifically requesting the metadata associated with these files, including but not limited to: Date of Creation, Date of Last Modification, Authoring User, and File Path.\r\n\r\n7. FILING AND AUDIT TRAIL RECORDS All records, including emails, internal memos, or \"Records Disposal Authorizations\" (Form RC-075), that document the date this document was placed into the physical folder of the Health Department.\r\n\r\nRecords obtained recently from the Office of the Public Records Administrator show that the latest records destroyed by the Danbury Health Department are from 2017. If any of these requested records have been destroyed, please include the properly executed RC-075 documents. I am also requesting that the Health Department refrain from destroying any records in connection with Hat City Ale house, Kevin Paige, or Paige Enterprises, Inc. until the fulfillment of this request is considered complete by both parties.\r\n\r\nFormat: Per CGS \u00a7 1-212(g), I request these records in their original electronic format to preserve the integrity of the embedded metadata. Providing a scanned PDF or a paper printout of an electronic file is a \"denial of access\" to the metadata which is itself a public record.\r\n\r\nFeel free to respond through this portal if there is any need for clarification of this request.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

THE \"CASAGRANDE DRAFT\" NATIVE FILE A copy of the native electronic file (original .doc, .docx, or .pdf format) for the document titled or known as the \"Revised Statement of Planned BusinessOperation\" authored by Attorney Dan Casagrande, which was recently located in the Health Department files regarding Hat City Ale House. A copy of the document is page 5 of the attached file and was returned in a prior FOI request on 1/5/26. This document bears my signature and was never submitted by me. Dan Casagrande presented this altered document in a discussion conference in January 2024. It was not marked for discussion or draft purposes. Who placed it in the file is unknown. It's existence was discovered by me on March 13, 2024. Upon which I notified Farley Santos of the Mayors staff. Farley Santos assured me that it had been removed/destroyed on or about March 21, 2024. It currently remains in the health department folder and does not represent statements I have ever submitted to the City of Danbury.\r\n\r\nSpecial Requirement: I am specifically requesting the metadata associated with this file, including but not limited to: Date of Creation, Date of Last Modification, Authoring User, and File Path.\r\n\r\n2. FILING AND AUDIT TRAIL RECORDS All records, including emails, internal memos, or \"Records Disposal Authorizations\" (Form RC-075), that document the date this document was placed into the physical folder of the Health Department.\r\n\r\n3. 2018 INTAKE RECORDS The original 13-page \"Intake Form\" or inspection report from the 2018 initial issuance of Food Service License for Hat City Ale House. If this record has been destroyed, please provide the corresponding RC-075 form authorizing its destruction as required by the State Library\u2019s retention schedule.\r\n\r\nFormat: Per CGS \u00a7 1-212(g), I request these records in their original electronic format to preserve the integrity of the embedded metadata. Providing a scanned PDF or a paper printout of an electronic file is a \"denial of access\" to the metadata which is itself a public record.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn.

Requests are processed in the order in which they are received; please do not submit duplicate entries for the same information. You will be contacted about the availability and/or provided with copies of the records in question based on your selected preferred method of delivery. PLEASE NOTE: The Ohio Public Records Act codified in R.C. Chapter 149 does not require a governmental body to create new information or records that do not already exist or are beyond state records retention schedules. \r\n \r\nYou can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will be contacted when your request has been completed. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgain, thank you for using the Ohio Department of Public Safety - Public Records Center. Effective July 1, 2025, the Ohio State Highway Patrol will assess a fee of $38.90 per hour of video requested. This fee is the cost associated with reviewing, blurring, redacting, uploading, and producing the video records (R.C. 149.43(B)(1)). Once we receive the requested video recordings from the post, if any, an invoice shall be provided to you with the associated costs and must be paid prior to processing the videos. If an invoice is not paid within 30 days, the invoice will be cancelled and the request for videos will be closed. All other items contained in the request will still be processed and released in accordance with Ohio Public Records law regardless of whether an invoice is paid. For example, a requester who asks for body cam video, a case report, and a training record but does not pay the video invoice within 30 days will still receive the case report and training record but the video will not be processed and released. \r\nOhio Department of Public Safety",
