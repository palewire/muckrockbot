This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

If we have not received your response within 30 working days from the date of this email, we will assume you are no longer interested in receiving the documents and the case will be administratively closed.

We apologize for the delay in responding to your request. However, because of the increasing number of requests received by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), we found it necessary to adopt the ruling in the case of Open America v. Watergate Special Prosecution Force, 547 F.2d 605 (D.C. Cir. 1976) and exercise due diligence by following a first-in, first-out FOIA processing.\r\nIf you are still interested in receiving the documents, please respond to this email, and we will complete the processing of your request. If we have not received your response within 30 working days from the date of this email, we will assume you are no longer interested in receiving the documents and the case will be administratively closed.

        "communication": "Dear U.S. Department of Education,\r\n\r\nIn official capacity on behalf of Fiat Fiendum only, not in personal capacity, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3):\r\n\r\n1. all records previously released under 5 USC 552(a)(3) by your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency,  corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1)\r\n\r\n2. all records of each request that resulted in any of those prior record releases, including all communications to and from the requester, records of searches conducted, and discussion of the request\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\nMy request is literally for all records you have previously released under FOIA, and for the associated records about the requests under which they were previously released.\r\n\r\nA major objective of this request is to get you to publish all released FOIA records, and all records about requests resulting in those releases, to your electronic FOIA \"reading room\", pursuant to 5 USC 552(a)(2)(D). There is therefore one exclusion: this request does not cover records that are already publicly available on your electronic FOIA reading room.\r\n\r\nOther than that, this request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and disclosed the records for item 1, and your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for item 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* by definition, FOIA releases are of public interest, this is exclusively about prior public releases, and making them more widely available advances the goals of the Act.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, please bear in mind the statutory obligation under 5 USC 552(a)(2)(D)(ii)(II) to post records to your electronic reading room if they have been \"requested\" 3 or more times, and released at least once under 552(a)(3).\r\n\r\nBy definition, all records responsive to item 1 of my request have been requested at least one previous time, and were released at least once under 552(a)(3). This request is at least one more \"request\" (and that clause is not conditioned on having achieved a release). There may well have been another prior \"request\". If there was, this request is at least the third, and therefore triggers the mandatory publication requirement. If not, I would nevertheless urge you to exercise your discretion to release them publicly.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S. My full legal name is just Sai. Please use no title for me.",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office,\r\n\r\nIn official capacity on behalf of Fiat Fiendum only, not in personal capacity, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3):\r\n\r\n1. all records previously released under 5 USC 552(a)(3) by your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency,  corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1)\r\n\r\n2. all records of each request that resulted in any of those prior record releases, including all communications to and from the requester, records of searches conducted, and discussion of the request\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\nMy request is literally for all records you have previously released under FOIA, and for the associated records about the requests under which they were previously released.\r\n\r\nA major objective of this request is to get you to publish all released FOIA records, and all records about requests resulting in those releases, to your electronic FOIA \"reading room\", pursuant to 5 USC 552(a)(2)(D). There is therefore one exclusion: this request does not cover records that are already publicly available on your electronic FOIA reading room.\r\n\r\nOther than that, this request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and disclosed the records for item 1, and your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for item 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* by definition, FOIA releases are of public interest, this is exclusively about prior public releases, and making them more widely available advances the goals of the Act.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, please bear in mind the statutory obligation under 5 USC 552(a)(2)(D)(ii)(II) to post records to your electronic reading room if they have been \"requested\" 3 or more times, and released at least once under 552(a)(3).\r\n\r\nBy definition, all records responsive to item 1 of my request have been requested at least one previous time, and were released at least once under 552(a)(3). This request is at least one more \"request\" (and that clause is not conditioned on having achieved a release). There may well have been another prior \"request\". If there was, this request is at least the third, and therefore triggers the mandatory publication requirement. If not, I would nevertheless urge you to exercise your discretion to release them publicly.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S. My full legal name is just Sai. Please use no title for me.",

Sai: \r\n\r\nA search of CBP databases produced records responsive to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request CBP-FO-2025-011200, requesting records maintained by CBP. \r\n\r\nCBP has determined that the responsive records are partially releasable, pursuant to Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 and have applied the appropriate exemptions notated below: \r\n\r\nExemption Summary: \r\n(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C) \r\n\r\nPursuant to DHS Instruction 262-11-004, FOIA Officers at DHS have been instructed to withhold personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) of DHS personnel unless a determination is made that the disclosure does not raise security or privacy concerns, or if those concerns are outweighed by any public interest in that information. This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request. For clarity, it is not the date the agency first created the record. \r\nThe following item(s) also apply to your request: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tApproximately [ 0 ] pages were withheld in their entirety. \r\n\u2022\tFees: In the processing of this FOIA request, no fees are being assessed. \r\n\u2022\tOther: No records exist for the spam or outgoing folders. \r\n\r\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2025-011200 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account. Any messages sent to this account will not be read. \r\nSincerely, \r\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.\r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request.\r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed.

For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\n\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use.

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\n\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\n\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.\r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request.\r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3.

McElwee: \r\n\r\nA search of CBP databases produced records responsive to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request CBP-FO-2024-006589, requesting records maintained by CBP. \r\n\r\nCBP has determined that the responsive records are partially releasable, pursuant to Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 and have applied the appropriate exemptions notated below: \r\n\r\nExemption Summary: \r\n(b)(6) (b)(7)(C) \r\nPursuant to exemption  (b)(6) (b)(7)(C), 0 pages have been withheld in full and 1 pages in part. \r\nPermits withholding of records and information about individuals when disclosure would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. \r\n\r\nPermits withholding of records when an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy could reasonably be expected. \r\n\r\nPursuant to DHS Instruction 262-11-004, FOIA Officers at DHS have been instructed to withhold personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) of DHS personnel unless a determination is made that the disclosure does not raise security or privacy concerns, or if those concerns are outweighed by any public interest in that information. This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request. For clarity, it is not the date the agency first created the record. \r\nThe following item(s) also apply to your request: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tApproximately [ 0 ] pages were withheld in their entirety. \r\n\u2022\tFees: In the processing of this FOIA request, no fees are being assessed. \r\n\u2022\tOther: \r\n\r\nThis completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 90 K St, NE MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process. Please notate file number CBP-FO-2024-006589 on any future correspondence to CBP related to this request. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.  Should you wish to do so, you must file your appeal within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS regulations at Title 6 C.F.R. \u00a75.8.  Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the grounds for your appeal.  You should submit your appeal via your SecureRelease account . If you do not have computer access, you may send your appeal and a copy of this letter to:  FOIA Appeals, Policy and Litigation Branch, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 90 K Street, NE, 10th Floor, Washington, DC 20229-1177.  Your envelope and letter should be marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.  Additional information can be found at the following link https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Dec/definitions-exemptions-foia_0.pdf. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. Please note that contacting the CBP FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS does not stop the 90-day appeal clock and is not a substitute for filing an administrative appeal. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

Your request has been assigned tracking number 02144EOUSA-2019-003239. \u00a0Please use this number in all future correspondence. \r\nYour request seeks records from one or more field offices, involves many voluminous records, or requires consultation with another agency or component with a substantial interest in the subject-matter and therefore falls within \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d as set forth in the statue. See 5 U.S.C.S \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Accordingly, we are extending the time limit to respond to our request for ten additional days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B))(i).\u00a0 In addition, this Office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately 30 business days, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track. \r\nUnder FOIA and Department of Justice regulations you may be required to pay certain costs associated with processing your request, including, searching for, reviewing, and duplicating requested records.\u00a0 Consequently, you may potentially incur those costs, unless you have requested and been granted a waiver or reduction in fees.\u00a0 In most instances, the first 100 pages to duplicate and the first two hours to search for records responsive to your request, will be provided to you free of charge.\u00a0 If after making those allowances, we determine that the cost to process your request will amount to more than $25.00, we will notify you in writing at a later date. [1] \u00a0Requests that are specific, concrete and of limited scope (in time and/or subject matter) generally enable us to respond to you more quickly and possibly assess less fees.\u00a0 To avoid delay and reduce any potential fees, we suggest you might wish to modify and narrow the scope of your request (See attachment).

The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThis request is expressly limited to Federal Railroad Administration's own FOIA office. Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
