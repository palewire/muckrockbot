The drug, publicly identified by the government as a hallucinogen, was reported to the DEA's NFLIS sometime between January 1st 2024 and September 30th 2024. A copy of the September 2024 NFLIS-Drug bulletin that mentions Deoxmethoxetamine should be attached to this request. \r\n\r\nThis is a request for any documents, reports, memorandum, or anything that could reasonably be construed as \"relevant documents\" related to Deoxmethoxetamine created by the NFLIS during this period. Please conduct a search any \"evaluations for scheduling\" or \"recommendations for scheduling\" or \"reports to NFLIS\" or \"reports from NFLIS\" regarding Deoxymethoxetamine aka \"3'-methyl-2-oxo-PCE\", \"DMXE\" and \"3D-MXE\".\r\n\r\nIf the Drug Enforcement Agency cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or certain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the Drug Enforcement Agency's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working together until this request is resolved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

On June 1, 2024, their Facebook account invited the public to view the vehicle. Here is a news article on this event. \r\nhttps://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/prosper-police-departments-emergency-vehicle/3560134/\r\n\r\nI am requesting all recorded uses of this MRAP vehicle and any other vehicles that have been obtained through the Federal 1033 program. This included uses by both Prosper and Collin County's police/sheriff departments. It was mentioned in new reporting that the vehicle can help neighboring communities in Collin County. This request includes an use of the vehicle for community engagement, like the news article, and uses for emergency rescues. If this vehicle was used in other counties, please include their uses of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a news media requester.
