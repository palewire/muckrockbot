Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210(c).\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros \r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-210(c).\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros \r\nABI Resources\r\n\r\nI also request that, if possible and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-212(d), fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest and not made for commercial gain. The requested documents will be made available to the public at MuckRock.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 4 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDAVID MEDEIROS",

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-200 et seq.), and all applicable federal and state transparency statutes.\r\n\r\nThis request is submitted in the interest of government accountability, financial oversight, and public transparency regarding the Connecticut Medicaid ABI Waiver Program, the Connecticut Comptroller\u2019s Office, and any funding, contracts, or oversight related to the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV).\r\n\r\nAccommodation Request:\r\nUnder Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794), I formally request that this FOIA request be forwarded to any departments, offices, or personnel that may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to ensure accessibility and compliance with federal disability law, I request that:\r\n\u2705 All records be provided in screen-reader compatible formats (searchable PDFs, plain-text files).\r\n\u2705 Key findings be embedded directly in email responses (rather than external portals).\r\n\u2705 All communications regarding this request remain within the original email chain for clarity and tracking.\r\n\r\nFailure to forward this request as required by law, or failure to provide an exhaustive search and production of responsive documents, may be considered noncompliance under FOIA and will be subject to appeal, administrative complaints, and legal escalation if necessary.\r\n\r\nA full response is expected within the statutory deadlines of FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)) and Conn.
