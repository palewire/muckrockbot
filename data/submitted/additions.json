This includes communications between the FBI and other law enforcement or government entities regarding these matters.\r\n\r\nLegal Citations:\r\nIn accordance with Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 142 (1989), and NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978), I expect a diligent search for records and a detailed justification for any withholdings under FOIA exemptions.\r\n\r\nInteragency Search:\r\nPursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C), I request an interagency search for records, considering the broad relevance of my query.\r\n\r\nFees and Costs:\r\nPlease notify me of any applicable fees in advance. The information requested is for public dissemination and not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nDenial of Request:\r\nIf denied, in whole or in part, I expect a written explanation with specific FOIA exemptions, as required by National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004).\r\n\r\nEnclosure Notice:\r\nFee_Waiver_Letter_copy_1.pdf\r\n\r\nPublication Warning:\r\nBe advised that the contents of your response, along with this request, will be made public. This information may also be used in court proceedings to ensure compliance with the FOIA.\r\n\r\nRecord of Correspondence:\r\nThis request and all responses will be part of the official record. Please assign a new FOIA request number for this submission, distinct from previous requests.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your timely response within the statutory 20-day period.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",
