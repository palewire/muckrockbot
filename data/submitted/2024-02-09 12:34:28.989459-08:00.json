Electronic copies of any/all RECORDS AND WRITINGS regarding the Washington\u2019s Council of School Attorneys (COSA) \"COSA listserv\" as described on the Washington State School Directors\u2019 Association (WSSDA) website: https://wssda.org/council-of-school-attorneys/.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS        *** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records last.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst or .pdf PORTFOLIO electronic format with the most records possible included per file and per each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS        *** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

The agency acknowledged receiving this request on May 23, 2023, and produced records on February 8, 2024. \r\n\r\nPlease produce at minimum, \r\n\r\n(1) the FOIA tasker CBP FOIA created assigning this request, \r\n(2) the Daily Media Summary CBP FOIA created including this request, and \r\n(3) the processing form any custodians created indicated systems of records searched, time spent searching, search terms, the date the search was tasked, and the time period searched. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), I respectfully request expedited processing and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. The records CBP FOIA released on February 8, 2024, encompass 44 individual deaths over a 9-month period (rather than the 99.5-month period we sought). \r\n2. The records set contains least 8 in-custody CBP deaths for which no prior record of public release by CBP appears to exist, in contravention of the agency's Death Notifications policy. \r\n3. The records set omits several publicly reported in-custody CBP deaths during the 9-month the records encompass, apparently putting CBP in violation of its obligations under DCRA. \r\n4. The General Accountability Office has repeatedly concluded CBP needed to improve its death reporting mechanisms. \r\n5. In-custody CBP deaths and federal law enforcement agencies' noncompliance with DCRA have been subject of widespread media criticism, with repeat findings of the noncompliance. \r\n6. I am a member of the media, primarily engaged in information dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The reason I ask, is I can run a single report that includes the times of all of the sheriff office employees from July 1, 2023 to present, but it would not be broken up into the bi-weekly timesheets. If this is ok, then there would not be a charge and I can email it back pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nIf you need it broken into Bi-weekly timesheets, then I would need to run several reports and it would take more time for me to create the requested info, so there would be a small charge for that.\r\n\r\nPlease clarify your request and if you need the bi-weekly reports I will provide you with an estimated cost.\r\n\r\n \r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDarcie Ragsdale\r\n\r\nHuman Resources | Bosque County\r\n\r\nPO Box 647 | Meridian, TX 76665\r\n\r\n104 West Morgan | Meridian, TX 76665\r\n\r\nP: 254-978-4810\r\n\r\nF: 254-651-1046 \r\n\r\nEmail: hr@bosquecounty.us",

I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination.\r\n2. I have submitted more than 200 FOA requests to DHS agency FOIA offices since May 2019. \r\n3. The vast majority of these requests remain in extended backlogs, often with processing times that far exceed the median and average times reported by the agency. \r\n4. DHS Agency FOIA offices have repeatedly excepted my requests from a first-in, first-out processing by providing responses to FOIA requests that contain the same information I sought, despite their filing the request after I did. \r\n5. DHS has not promulgated any regulation or published any subregulatory rule, policy, procedure, guidance, manual, or other instruction to staff regarding the targeting or use of a vexsome filer or similar designation. \r\n6. Consequently, any application of such internal designation to requests I have submitted would appear violate 5 USC 552(a)(2)(E)(i) & (ii). \r\n7. DHS FOIA offices have repeatedly been held to engage in a pattern and practice of FOIA violations by federal courts. See, e.g., Owen v. ICE (CD Cal), Nightengale v. USCIS (ND Cal). \r\n8. There is an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged government misconduct - namely, the use/misuse of a vexsome FOIA filer list to deny, slow, or meter requestors' FOIA productions based on the frequency with which we exercise our statutory rights to demand information from our (nominally) democratically accountable institutions. \r\n9. Placing this request in the regular track for processing will doom it to multi-month, if not multi-year purgatory at your agency's current processing rate, effectively covering up the potentially unlawful practice of discriminatory treatment based on the frequency with which a particular requestor exercises their statutory right to seek information about what our government is up to. \r\n\r\nThank you for your timely consideration of this expedited processing request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny list of Freedom of Information Act requestors identified as vexatious, vexsome, litigious, burdensome or otherwise designated for specialized processing, supervisory-level or legal-counsel-level review, or tracking by your agency's FOIA office. \r\n\r\nBy way of example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has maintained a \"Vexsome Filer\" list for years, according to records released by expert FOIA requestor and journalist John Greenwald: https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/fbi-issues-redacted-vexsome-filer-list-marking-departure-from-past-transparency-practices/. \r\n\r\nPlease task a search beginning on January 1, 2023, and continuing until the day on which your FOIA office initiates the search. \r\n\r\nPlease search your FOIA office first, but, in accordance with Iturralde, follow up on any obvious leads. \r\n\r\nI am willing to this request if the volume of documents returned exceeds 500 pages. \r\n\r\nI hereby request expedited processing of this request, and pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), I make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination.\r\n2. I have submitted more than 200 FOA requests to DHS agency FOIA offices since May 2019. \r\n3. The vast majority of these requests remain in extended backlogs, often with processing times that far exceed the median and average times reported by the agency. \r\n4. DHS Agency FOIA offices have repeatedly excepted my requests from a first-in, first-out processing by providing responses to FOIA requests that contain the same information I sought, despite their filing the request after I did. \r\n5. DHS has not promulgated any regulation or published any subregulatory rule, policy, procedure, guidance, manual, or other instruction to staff regarding the targeting or use of a vexsome filer or similar designation. \r\n6. Consequently, any application of such internal designation to requests I have submitted would appear violate 5 USC 552(a)(2)(E)(i) & (ii). \r\n7. DHS FOIA offices have repeatedly been held to engage in a pattern and practice of FOIA violations by federal courts. See, e.g., Owen v. ICE (CD Cal), Nightengale v. USCIS (ND Cal). \r\n8. There is an urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged government misconduct - namely, the use/misuse of a vexsome FOIA filer list to deny, slow, or meter requestors' FOIA productions based on the frequency with which we exercise our statutory rights to demand information from our (nominally) democratically accountable institutions. \r\n9. Placing this request in the regular track for processing will doom it to multi-month, if not multi-year purgatory at your agency's current processing rate, effectively covering up the potentially unlawful practice of discriminatory treatment based on the frequency with which a particular requestor exercises their statutory right to seek information about what our government is up to. \r\n\r\nThank you for your timely consideration of this expedited processing request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

FlagWix began selling overtly political flags during the 2020 political election. FlagWix made a massive advertising buy on Facebook and Instagram running targeted ads to residents of the state of Georgia offering Confederate flags. These ads, which Meta's corporate legal team was alerted to of at the time, likely ran afoul of Meta's advertising rules at the time. \r\n\r\nAccording to a book scheduled to be published in coming months, Flagwix \"invented\" and popularized an American flag design featuring Jesus Christ. The company also reportedly created (and then marketed) an all black flag American flag that gained popularity among far-right activists in the United States in 2021. \r\n\r\nReporting suggests that FlagWix is based in China, and the ownership of the company is likely connected to the Chinese Communist Party. The personal information of FlagWix customers provides a Chinese Communist Party-linked entity with a trove of information regarding the political beliefs of numerous American citizens. \r\n\r\nIf Flagwix (or it's subsidiary dixiebone.com) are currently under Bureau investigation, please do not deny the entire request and release any information available under the law. If you cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or certain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThank you for the Bureau's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working with you on this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
