In Buffalo News, Inc. v. Buffalo Enterprise Development Corp., 84 N.Y.2d 488, 493 (1994), the court held that \"[e]xemptions from disclosure must be narrowly construed, with the burden resting on the agency to demonstrate that the requested material falls squarely within a FOIL exemption.\" Therefore, I respectfully request that you provide me with a written explanation for any exemption claimed for the requested documents.\r\n\r\nPlease note that any deletion, redaction, or withholding of information that is not specifically exempted under FOIL will be considered a violation of the law, and I will file a complaint and take legal action to compel the disclosure of the information.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",
