Mr. Tetens has written me telling me that there are numerous people and entities he or someone in his office has contacted and that all of them have refused to take any of the Complaints. Please send me the names of who he is referring to. The email from Mr. Tetens to me is enclosed.     \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nFrom:\r\njosh.tetens@co.mclennan.tx.us\r\nTo:\r\nbfeazell@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nThu, May 1 at 10:59 AM\r\n\r\nDear Ms. Feazell,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Rangers still have those cases, but our office has yet to find another office willing to accept the cases for further review and/or prosecution. Weekly we reach out to new offices requesting they accept the cases, but all, including the Attorney General\u2019s Office, have refused to date.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJosh Tetens\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease also know that when Sterling, the lawyer who will get this, does get this he will, once again try to buy time and ask me to prove that this is indeed Bernadette Feazell, so please, once again enlighten him to google \"muckrock\" and see that, indeed, other places honor Muckrock and perhaps he should read about it and honor it also.  Muckrock is a Public Information non profit, and easily found by a search.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBernadette Feazell",
