I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAccess to a file unit contained in the Records of the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. This information was initially requested during a visit to the National Archives and Records Administrations' Textual Archives at College Park, Maryland, but access was denied at that time and it was explained by NARA staff that a FOIA request would be required. Pull information for this request is as follows:\r\n\r\nRecord Group: 340\r\nSeries: General Decimal Files, 1955-1955\r\nFile Unit: 352 [Army Service and Technical Schools, Staff Colleges, and Troop Schools]\r\nEntry: UD 1-D\r\nNAID: 26422156\r\nBox/Container: 135\r\nLocation: 131 A 022/055/02\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please advise of which tier of processing queue this request falls under and an estimated time frame for processing.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
