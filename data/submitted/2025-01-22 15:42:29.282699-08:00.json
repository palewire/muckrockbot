        "communication": "Dear FBI:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED\r\n\r\nI request all records related to Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez, the Puerto Rican-American activist. Mr. Jim\u00e9nez was born on 8 August 1948 in Caguas, Puerto Rico and died on 10 January 2025.  Jim\u00e9nez was a civil rights and liberation movement figure, founder of the Young Lords, and co-founder of the Rainbow Coalition.\r\n\r\nOTHER NAMES USED\r\n\r\nThe subject was known by the nickname \u201cCha Cha\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe subject\u2019s first and last names contain the Spanish-language letter \u201c\u00e9\" (an \u201ce\" with an accent mark). When searching for responsive records, please search for \u201cJos\u00e9\u201d and \u201cJim\u00e9nez\" (with the accent mark) as well as \u201cJose\u201d and \u201cJimenez\" (without accent marks). \r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH\r\n\r\nI have attached Mr. Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s news obituary from the Washington Post.\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH\r\n\r\nIn addition to your standard search, please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center and the Central Records Complex (CRC) in Winchester/Frederick County, Virginia. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed or transferred to NARA, please produce all records related to the transfer or destruction.\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\n\r\nIn addition to your standard search, please conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and organizations to see if they contain additional records related to Mr. Jim\u00e9nez:\r\n\r\n(1) Young Lords\r\n(2) Rainbow Coalition\r\n(3) Black Panther Party\r\n(4) Young Patriots Organization\r\n(5) Fred Hampton (Fredrick Allen Hampton Sr., leader in the Black Panther Party, born 30 August 1948 in Chicago, IL, died 4 December 1969)\r\n(6) William \"Preacherman\u201d Fesperman (leader in the Young Patriots Organization, lifedates unknown)\r\n(7) COINTELPRO\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks information that, to my knowledge, is not already in the public domain. Of course, without already knowing what records the Bureau has, I can't say for sure whether those records are already in the public domain or what the public would learn from them; however, because Mr. Jim\u00e9nez has recently died, the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\nThere are specific reasons to believe that the records will contribute to the public\u2019s understanding of Mr. Jim\u00e9nez because, according to his Washington Post news obituary (attached), he and the Rainbow Coalition attracted the Bureau\u2019s attention.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Jim\u00e9nez was a public figure. News obituaries for Mr. Jim\u00e9nez appeared in the Washington Post and on NPR, among other places. According to his Washington Post obituary: \"Mr. Jim\u00e9nez joined forces with Fred Hampton of the Black Panther Party and William \u2018Preacherman' Fesperman of the Young Patriots Organization to form the Rainbow Coalition, a working-class, multiracial movement that brought together Blacks, Latinos and poor Whites from Appalachia that later resulted in the upending of politics in the American Midwest.\u201d Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Mr. Jim\u00e9nez has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released before. Again, I cannot be 100% sure if factor is satisfied without already knowing what records the Bureau has. However, given Mr. Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s status as a public figure, the Bureau should deem this factor satisfied. I am also making this request via MuckRock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that will allow anyone in the world to access all responsive records online for free.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nI would prefer that you fulfill this request electronically, producing responsive records via email attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThank you for responding to this request.",

L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. \r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:  \r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)  \r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and  \r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).   \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.  \r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).  \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.

Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.  \r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format.

L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. \r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G.

Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).   \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.  \r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).  \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis\r\n\r\nJ.D.
