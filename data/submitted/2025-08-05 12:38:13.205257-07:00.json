According to documents released to me by the Marines through FOIA (see attached), the Marines provided support to this production in 2022. I therefore request any and all documents pertaining to Marine Corps support for \"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One.\" Such documents may include but should not be not limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; photographs; and all records of communications between employees of the Marines and members of the cast, crew, and production company of \"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation as well as the editor-in-chief and a contributor to a research magazine published by said foundation titled \"Cultural Engineering Studies.\" These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

All requests are processed in the order in which they are received, and no requests are prioritized by deadline date. The amount of time to completely process your request depends upon the number of pending requests, volume of material encompassed in the request, and the amount of redaction, if any, that is necessary.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware, if you are requesting records with large amount of body camera videos and or high-profile cases, the time to complete your request may be significantly longer as these cases are often voluminous. Identifying the specific record(s) being requested may help expedite your request. You will be notified once records are made available for you to download or pick up, or if no records are found. Your tracking # is 2160. When checking the status of your request, please send emails to mediarequest@mcso.maricopa.gov<mailto:mediarequest@mcso.maricopa.gov> and include your tracking #.\r\n\r\n***Pursuant to ARS 39-129, the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office (MCSO) Legal Liaison Section has implemented a fee schedule for requests for video recordings.  The fee for processing video recordings is $25 per each video-hour ($6.25 per quarter hour).  In the event there are contemporaneous multiple requests for the same video, the cost associated with processing the video will be shared equally between all requesting parties at that time. Requests for previously processed videos will be at no cost unless the requestor wishes to receive a hard copy instead of an electronic copy. Fees for hardcopies are listed below. ***\r\n\r\nThe fee breakdown for hard copies are as follows:\r\n\r\nDocuments:                       $.50 for each page\r\n\r\nCD\u2019s:                                      $15.00 each\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\nCalbert Gillett\r\n[Sent from Front]\n",
