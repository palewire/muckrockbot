Specifically, I am seeking a spreadsheet, database, or delimited text file(s) \u2014 not paper records or a PDF created from data \u2014 with the following information for each individual disciplinary infraction: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tInmate name\r\n\u2022\tInmate ID number assigned by the department\r\n\u2022\tDate\r\n\u2022\tFull legal name of the officer issuing the infraction\r\n\u2022\tFull legal name of supervising officer\r\n\u2022\tFull legal name of the disciplinary hearing officer (if applicable) \r\n\u2022\tThe facility the incident occurred in\r\n\u2022\tSecurity level inmate is held in\r\n\u2022\tTime of the incident\r\n\u2022\tPlace of the incident within the prison\r\n\u2022\tOfficer\u2019s written description of the incident\r\n\u2022\tInmate\u2019s response to the infraction\r\n\u2022\tWas force used and what type of force?\r\n\u2022\tSpecific infractions accused of\r\n\u2022\tSeverity level of the infraction\r\n\u2022\tOutcome of the infraction (guilty, not guilty, withdrawn, etc.) \r\n\u2022\tPenalty from the infraction (days of lost good time, days of solitary confinement, lost privileges, etc.)\r\n\u2022\tWas the penalty from the infraction changed or reduced at a later time?\r\n\u2022\tWas the infraction appealed?\r\n\u2022\tNames of witnesses involved\r\n\r\nI recognize that each type of incident has different reporting requirements, so these are the general fields I need. \r\n\r\nI also recognize that this is a large request. The request is intentionally broad because I do not know what data the department maintains or for what timeframe. If necessary, I can refine my request due to data availability, time or cost considerations. \r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance with this request. Please do not hesitate to contact for questions or clarifications.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
