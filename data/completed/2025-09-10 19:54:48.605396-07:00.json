I am aware of prior requests, including those in *Roman v. Dep't of the Air Force, No. 12-1381 (EGS) (D.D.C. 2013)*, which sought locations of HAARP devices and test dates. To avoid duplication, I seek only records created, declassified, or otherwise made available after July 9, 2013, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Documents related to the transfer of HAARP facilities or operations to the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2015 or later, including agreements, environmental impact assessments, and declassification reviews.\r\n2. Reports, memoranda, emails, or cables concerning HAARP's goals, scope, testing dates, or additional facilities (beyond the known Gakona, Alaska site) from 2013 to the present, including any segregable portions of classified records.\r\n3. Records referenced in the George W. Bush Presidential Library finding aid for FOIA 2014-0038-F, such as drafts of the U.S. Arctic Research Plan Biennial Revision: 2004\u20132008, or electronic records (e.g., TS emails from 2001-2008) that have been declassified and transferred to Air Force custody.\r\n4. Any indexes, Vaughn lists, or descriptions of records withheld in the *Roman* case, including updates on their classification status post-2013.\r\n5. Communications between the Air Force and other agencies (e.g., DARPA, Navy, NSF) regarding HAARP operations, funding, or research after 2013.\r\n\r\nIf responsive records are classified or otherwise exempt from disclosure, please: (1) conduct a declassification review under Executive Order 13526; (2) release any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions; and (3) provide a detailed explanation, including applicable FOIA exemptions (e.g., 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)), along with a Vaughn index describing each withheld document.\r\n\r\nI request a fee waiver, as disclosure is in the public interest, contributing to understanding government research programs and transparency in ionospheric studies. If fees apply, please notify me in advance if they exceed $25.\r\n\r\nPlease provide records in electronic format (PDF) via email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nProduct brochures, Powerpoint presentations, flyers and other promotional business documents about defense and technology company Nice Systems Ltd. -- also known as \"NICE\" or \"NICE's Cyber and Intelligence division\" or \"CYBERBIT LTD\" or  \"CYBERBIT\" or \"Elbit Systems Ltd.\" -- describing products and/or services relating to offensive cybersecurity, surveillance, electronic warfare, virtual operations, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The focus of the requests involves product documents that may carry terminology/keywords/descriptions such as: Computer Network Operations (CNO), Computer Network Exploitation (CNE), Computer Network Attacks (CNA), cyber intelligence and signals intelligence (SIGINT). NICE is an Israeli/American technology contractor that sells surveillance and internet monitoring capabilities. The firm has offices around the world, including in the United States, but it is primarily managed from Israel. NICE is known for producing high-tech products for national security and law enforcement agencies to help them conduct surveillance against threats, including terrorism and criminal entities. NICE' cyber and intelligence division was acquired by Elbit Systems Ltd., via a subsidiary called CYBERBIT, in 2015; meaning that references to NICE's technology may carry that name as well, especially more recently. \r\n\r\nThis FOIA seeks any materials produced by the contractor to explain/sell/market their cyber intelligence capabilities/offerings to the U.S. government between the years 2014 and 2020 (or the current date of review). Such material would be likely held/controlled by the appropriate business contracting office within the agency and/or other divisions that make purchase/contracting decisions. NICE/Elbit have tried to sell their products to various different US security organizations in the past.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChristopher Bing\n\n",

        "communication": "\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nFiles mentioning or discussing the 1973 CIA personnel reduction in Vietnam described in LOC-HAK-38-3-3-3.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

Maryland and/or Giglio v. United States.\"  Because those two lists have since been updated, we are providing you with updated copies of those lists.\r\n\r\nIn our email of July 18, 2025, we also asked if you could clarify the second portion of your request for \"any and all records regarding substantiated allegations of misconduct or violations of internal department policy or criminal law by specific law enforcement officers.\"  On July 23, 2025, you responded with:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  I'm looking for officers both in your local jurisdiction and statewide.\r\n  2.  I'm seeking any records you all maintain, regardless of year.\r\n\r\nOur office has located 114 documents/files (approximately 83 MB) of responsive records to provide you in response to the second portion of your request.  When you and I spoke back in July, you indicated I could upload our responsive records through the link provided with your initial request, which was:\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fchelan-county-prosecuting-attorney-35584%252Fpolice-disciplinary-files-chelan-county-prosecuting-attorney-189437%252F%253Femail%253DProsecuting.Attorney%252540co.chelan.wa.us&url_auth_token=AAGs-YaqqtdwBrm4yCd9Z0Mlj90%3A1ueeqi%3AvvydlMSSSLtvhQHLLK462Qs0c6aZRe7tV_SoMlt6w78\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nLYEUWFWJ\r\nI have clicked on the above link as requested, but I keep receiving this error message:\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DC219B.FE456340]\r\n\r\nSince I cannot access the above site to upload our office's responsive records, I am providing them to you through our secure file transfer protocol, Liquid Files.  The link to access/download the records from Liquid Files is located at the bottom of this email.

This program was described in a 1975 memo as\r\n    \"Recording of Soviet purchases in such areas -- intelligence and\r\n    counterintelligence purposes.\"\r\n    (https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2018/docid-32989624.pdf)\r\n    \r\n    Please conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not\r\n    limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone\r\n    Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and\r\n    the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and\r\n    cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and\r\n    companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at\r\n    the Alexandria Records Center.

If previously released records are available, then I request a\r\n    rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are\r\n    located and processed for release.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function.\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request.\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed.  If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data.\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set)\r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes\r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations?\r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses.\r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations\r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request.\r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored.\r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\").\r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example:\r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps.\r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings.\r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements\r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems.\r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement\r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding:\r\n- Placement location recommendations\r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement\r\n- Community concerns or opposition\r\n- Equity or privacy impacts\r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale\r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion.\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail)\r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.  Please include:\r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.\r\n- Date and time of access\r\n- Name and Job Title of User\r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query)\r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged\r\n2. Network Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests.\r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1.\r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to:\r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement\r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors\r\n- Surveillance technology policy\r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOmar Solis",

        "communication": "Dear Omar Solis: The Hayward Police Department received a request for police records from you on 6/8/2025. Your request mentioned: \r\n\"To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function.\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request.\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data.\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set)\r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes\r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations?\r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses.\r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations\r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request.\r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored.\r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\").\r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example:\r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps.\r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings.\r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements\r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025.\r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025.\r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems.\r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement\r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding:\r\n- Placement location recommendations\r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement\r\n- Community concerns or opposition\r\n- Equity or privacy impacts\r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale\r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion.\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail)\r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. Please include:\r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.\r\n- Date and time of access\r\n- Name and Job Title of User\r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query)\r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged\r\n2. Network Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests.\r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1.\r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to:\r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement\r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors\r\n- Surveillance technology policy\r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOmar Solis\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhayward-police-department-5650%252Fautomated-license-plate-reader-alpr-records-request-hayward-police-department-187607%252F%253Femail%253DLeah.Mendes%252540hayward-ca.gov&url_auth_token=AAAa3kcL3Wrbd9x3rteHtE-_Gc0%3A1uOTEa%3An5muBVlzWFGtN4emHE78bal4vmdR0uvLyRG2iR5IRBA\" Your request has been referred to the appropriate HPD staff for follow-up, and we will provide you with an email response by June 20, 2025.

Your request mentioned: \r\n\"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025. \r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. \r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request. \r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025. \r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025. \r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data. \r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software. \r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act \r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist. \r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought. \r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set) \r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes \r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations? \r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses. \r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations \r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request. \r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored. \r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\"). \r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example: \r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps. \r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings. \r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements \r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems. \r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement \r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding: \r\n- Placement location recommendations \r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement \r\n- Community concerns or opposition \r\n- Equity or privacy impacts \r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale \r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion. \r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail) \r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. Please include: \r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency. \r\n- Date and time of access \r\n- Name and Job Title of User \r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query) \r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged \r\n2. Network Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System. \r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests. \r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1. \r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to: \r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement \r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors \r\n- Surveillance technology policy \r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nOmar Solis \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhayward-police-department-5650%252Fautomated-license-plate-reader-alpr-records-request-hayward-police-department-187607%252F%253Femail%253DLeah.Mendes%252540hayward-ca.gov&url_auth_token=AAAa3kcL3Wrbd9x3rteHtE-_Gc0%3A1uOTEa%3An5muBVlzWFGtN4emHE78bal4vmdR0uvLyRG2iR5IRBA\" The City will need additional time to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded.

Your request mentioned: \r\n\u201cTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025. \r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. \r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request. \r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025. \r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025. \r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data. \r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software. \r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act \r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist. \r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought. \r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set) \r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes \r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations? \r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses. \r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations \r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request. \r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored. \r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\"). \r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example: \r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps. \r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings. \r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements \r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems. \r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement \r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding: \r\n- Placement location recommendations \r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement \r\n- Community concerns or opposition \r\n- Equity or privacy impacts \r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale \r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion. \r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail) \r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. Please include: \r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency. \r\n- Date and time of access \r\n- Name and Job Title of User \r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query) \r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged \r\n2. Network Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System. \r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests. \r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1. \r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to: \r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement \r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors \r\n- Surveillance technology policy \r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nOmar Solis \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhayward-police-department-5650%252Fautomated-license-plate-reader-alpr-records-request-hayward-police-department-187607%252F%253Femail%253DLeah.Mendes%252540hayward-ca.gov&url_auth_token=AAAa3kcL3Wrbd9x3rteHtE-_Gc0%3A1uOTEa%3An5muBVlzWFGtN4emHE78bal4vmdR0uvLyRG2iR5IRBA\u201d \r\nThe Hayward Police Department has reviewed its files and has located responsive records to your request. Please log in to the Public Records Portal at the following link to retrieve the appropriate responsive documents. \r\nPolice Department - Public Records Request - P000279-060825 \r\n\r\nPlease note: You will have 60 days and/or 5 downloads to save and print your responsive records before they are no longer available through this request. \r\nSome of the information requested is exempt from release under the California Public Records Act (CPRA). See Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1798.90.5 et. seq (S.B. 34); Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1798.90.55(b); Gov. Code, \u00a7 7923.600, subd. (a). The information is also exempt from release since the public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure as revealing the location of ALPR cameras would interfere with law enforcement\u2019s ability to enforce against criminality and public nuisances. Gov. Code, \u00a7 7922.000 \r\nAdditionally, to the extent records responsive to your request include privileged material (attorney-client and deliberative process privileges, that confidential information has been redacted and will not be released. Gov. Code, \u00a7 7927.70; Fairley v. Superior Court 66 Cal.App.4th 1414, 1420\u20131422; Costco Wholesale Corporation v. Superior Court (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 733; Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company v. Superior Court (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1272\u20131275; Clark v. Superior Court (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 37, 49\u201352; Evid. Code \u00a71040. Disclosure of certain pre-decisional communications between staff are also confidential and exempt from released on the CPRA, since disclosure of such materials would expose the City\u2019s decision-making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the City, thereby undermining the City\u2019s ability to perform its own functions. Times Mirror Company v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1338; Gov. Code, \u00a7 7922.000; Evid. Code \u00a71040. \r\nWithout waiving the above objections and exemptions, the City is nonetheless releasing records responsive to this request. Due to the overlybroad nature of the request and the number and volume of potentially responsive records, the City is still reviewing potentially responsive records and will provide all non-exempt records on a rolling basis as soon as they are available. \r\nIf you have any questions, or wish to discuss this further, please contact the Public Records Desk at 510-293-7014. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\nHAYWARD POLICE DEPARTMENT \r\n\r\nGiuliana Garibay-Ore \r\nRecords Clerk \r\n\r\nThis is an auto-generated email and has originated from an unmonitored email account.

Your request mentioned: \r\n\u201cTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025. \r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. \r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request. \r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025. \r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025. \r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data. \r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software. \r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act \r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist. \r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought. \r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set) \r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes \r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations? \r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses. \r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations \r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request. \r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored. \r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\"). \r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example: \r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps. \r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings. \r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements \r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems. \r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement \r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding: \r\n- Placement location recommendations \r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement \r\n- Community concerns or opposition \r\n- Equity or privacy impacts \r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale \r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion. \r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail) \r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. Please include: \r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency. \r\n- Date and time of access \r\n- Name and Job Title of User \r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query) \r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged \r\n2. Network Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System. \r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests. \r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1. \r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to: \r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement \r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors \r\n- Surveillance technology policy \r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nOmar Solis \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhayward-police-department-5650%252Fautomated-license-plate-reader-alpr-records-request-hayward-police-department-187607%252F%253Femail%253DLeah.Mendes%252540hayward-ca.gov&url_auth_token=AAAa3kcL3Wrbd9x3rteHtE-_Gc0%3A1uOTEa%3An5muBVlzWFGtN4emHE78bal4vmdR0uvLyRG2iR5IRBA\u201d \r\nWithout waiving the previous asserted objections and exemptions the City of Hayward is releasing additional non-exempt records responsive to your request.\u00a0 The City will continue to release non-exempt responsive records on a rolling basis as soon as the records are available for release.

Your request mentioned: \r\n\"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025. \r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. \r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request. \r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025. \r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025. \r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data. \r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software. \r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act \r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist. \r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought. \r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set) \r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes \r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations? \r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses. \r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations \r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request. \r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored. \r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\"). \r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example: \r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps. \r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings. \r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements \r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems. \r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement \r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding: \r\n- Placement location recommendations \r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement \r\n- Community concerns or opposition \r\n- Equity or privacy impacts \r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale \r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion. \r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail) \r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. Please include: \r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency. \r\n- Date and time of access \r\n- Name and Job Title of User \r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query) \r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged \r\n2. Network Audit in Flock. \r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System. \r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests. \r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1. \r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to: \r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement \r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors \r\n- Surveillance technology policy \r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nOmar Solis \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fhayward-police-department-5650%252Fautomated-license-plate-reader-alpr-records-request-hayward-police-department-187607%252F%253Femail%253DLeah.Mendes%252540hayward-ca.gov&url_auth_token=AAAa3kcL3Wrbd9x3rteHtE-_Gc0%3A1uOTEa%3An5muBVlzWFGtN4emHE78bal4vmdR0uvLyRG2iR5IRBA\" \r\nThe Hayward Police Department has identified records that are responsive to your request.

You are seeking records pertaining to show the total number of deportations, removals, and returns carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement between April 1, 2025 and August 15, 2025. \n\nThese documents are on the https://www.ice.gov/foia/library and search for 2025-ICLI-00019 \nIf you deem this to be an adverse determination, you may exercise your appeal rights.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you need any further assistance or would like to discuss any aspect of your request, please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.

This request does not dispute that point. Instead, it seeks to determine whether COOG has adopted any policy\u2014formal or informal\u2014concerning whether staff may transmit neutral, fact-only complaints or notices when they encounter such conduct in FOIL appeals and determinations that agencies are required by law to forward to COOG (\u00a7 89(4)(a)).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this request is to ensure transparency: either to confirm that no such policy exists (meaning COOG has discretion but chooses not to act), or to identify any written guidance that explains why complaint-forwarding is prohibited. In either case, the public has an interest in understanding how systemic FOIL violations are handled when they rise to the level of potential criminal conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecords sought (Jan. 1, 2020\u2013present):\r\n\r\nA. Any written policy, SOP, memo, training slide, or email guidance adopted or used by COOG that addresses whether COOG staff may (or may not) transmit complaints, notices, or factual summaries to\r\n\r\n(i) the State Inspector General\r\n(ii) county district attorneys\r\n(iii) the Office of the State Comptroller Investigations\r\n or (iv) the Attorney General Public Integrity Bureau\r\n\r\nconcerning potential willful concealment or destruction of FOIL\u2011responsive records.\r\n\r\nB. Any records reflecting instances in which COOG transmitted (or declined to transmit) such complaints/notices to any of the authorities in A.\r\n\r\nC. Any legal analysis produced for or held by COOG that interprets FOIL \u00a7\u00a7 89(1)(b), 89(2)(a), 89(4)(a) and/or Penal Law \u00a7 240.65 in relation to COOG\u2019s ability to forward factual materials to enforcement authorities.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",
