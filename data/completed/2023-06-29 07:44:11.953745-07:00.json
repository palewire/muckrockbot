Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\nPlease note, the District is currently experiencing an unusually high volume of extensive and complex public records requests and is processing requests in the order received and clarified. Given the unprecedented quantity of pending records requests, the District anticipates it will be able to complete this request by June 27, 2023.\r\nUnder the Public Disclosure Act, districts may not charge for locating documents or for inspection. The district will assess a fee of .15 cents per page for any copying. The District will email files to you and does not anticipate a fee.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at 425-936-1342 or via email at sparthemer@lwsd.org<mailto:sparthemer@lwsd.org>\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nShannon Parthemer, APR\r\nDirector of Communications\r\nLake Washington School District\n",

The courts have been consistent that name, address, telephone number, and email addresses of public records requestors are NOT EXEMPT from disclosure. \r\n \r\n 1.\tYou have provided no exemption logs. Why are you redacting information? What exemptions are you claiming under the PRA?\r\n \r\n 2. You have transformed and modified these original records requested into new records with new filenames. You have created new records which was not requested. \r\n \r\n For instance, file \"LWSD-Muckrock_000163.pdf\" refers to a request including the following:\r\n \r\n \"Dear Mr. Boyd:\r\n \r\n Attached please find the records responsive for your May 11, 2015 request for:\r\n \r\n Access to and a copy of all data related to concussion incidents for high school athletes at all high schools in the district but at least Lake Washington High School for sports years 2004-2014. All data with columns related to date, sport, season, age, gender, days kept out, and any records associated with district recording related to the Lystedt Law CRCW.28A.600. 190.\"\r\n \r\n However no responsive records are attached. Another .pdf file in the installment does refer to concussion incident reports, however as a requestor I am not obligated to assume, guess, or infer that this file which was attached to a response to Mr. Bord's request, a file which you have extracted and renamed from the originally requested PRA response if it is in fact the original attachment. \r\n \r\n Additionally, missing  is Mr. Boyd's original public records request as well as others, however we are not given enough context to understand what is missing and what is not.\r\n\r\n3. What records does this \"installment 1\" represent? You provide no context, meanwhile Lake Washington School District has already provided multiple installments of records. This is certainly not \"Installment One.\" Please explain in detail. \r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records again as requested, unredacted or with the proper exemption logs and explanations of what records are being provided, what records are being withheld, and why. \r\n\r\n4. We understand that now the District is for the 4th time giving a new \"final\"  estimated completion date for this request as 02-28-2023 (modified from the original missed final estimated completion date of 07-15-2022 Originally Provided by the District on 11-21-21).\r\n\r\nThank you.",

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

The admission process may not be commenced until the admitting staff member is satisfied that the admittee has received medical attention. (b) During the admission process, the admitting staff member shall determine whether the admittee is in need of any medical attention by inspecting for obvious injuries or illnesses, and by inquiring about any medical problems or recent use of medication or unprescribed drugs. Juveniles who appear to be ill, injured, or incapacitated by alcohol, narcotics, or similar agents, but not in immediate need of medical attention, must be given medical attention as soon as practical.

Secure confinement for periods of more than 24 hours must be reviewed every 24 hours by the superintendent or the superintendent's designee who was not involved in the incident necessitating that confinement. Secure confinement may be extended for additional periods if necessary for the safety of juveniles or others, or to ensure the safety of the facility. Secure confinement may not exceed five 24-hour periods. (b) A facility shall provide appropriate services and programs for high-risk juveniles who cannot control their assaultive behavior, who present a danger to themselves, or who are in constant danger of being victimized by other juveniles, thus requiring special management. The facility may, if the facility determines that it necessary, separate such juveniles from the general population to allow for individualized attention.\r\n\r\nRelevant DJJ policies are attached.\r\n\r\n3.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Cobb,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the 501(c)3 non-profit organization Reclaim The Records, I would like to request a\r\ncopy of the following files from the New York City Municipal Archives and its parent agency the New\r\nYork City Department of Records and Information Services (DORIS), under the New York State\r\nFreedom of Information Law (FOIL):\r\n\r\n1) Every single digital image you have, and any text metadata that goes with them.\r\n\r\nAs the Archives is undoubtedly aware, New York law states that \u201c...FOIL does not differentiate\r\nbetween records stored in paper form or those stored in electronic format...if the records are maintained\r\nelectronically by an agency and are retrievable with reasonable effort, that agency is required to\r\ndisclose the information.\u201d Matter of Data Tree, LLC v Romaine, 9 N.Y.3d 454, 464 (2007).\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are requesting a copy of every already-digitized image file of a historical\r\ndocument that DORIS has in its possession. This includes, but is not limited to, all the digital images\r\nthat are available online already, on the Archives' official \"Digital Collections\" website at\r\nhttp://nycma.lunaimaging.com/ which is run in conjunction with the company Luna Imaging, or on any\r\nother website maintained or controlled by the Archives or by DORIS.\r\n\r\nFor example, these records include, but are not limited to, all the digitized images of all the\r\ncollections the Archives has already placed online in recent years, such as the \u201cAlmshouse Collection,\r\n1758-1952\u201d, \u201cNew York County Jury Census, 1816-1821\u201d, \u201cBodies in Transit Registers, 1859-1894\u201d,\r\n\u201cLiquor licenses, Manhattan and Brooklyn, 1895-1986\u201d [sic \u2013 should be 1895-1896], the 1940's era\r\nNew York City \u201cTax Photos\u201d collection, the various \u201cBooks and Manuscripts\u201d files (including the\r\nbook of Colonial era deeds for Queens county, previously thought to be lost), the\u201cWPA Federal\r\nWriters' Project, NYC Unit Photograph Collection, 1935-1943\u201d and so on.\r\n\r\nThis request also includes all the digital images of historical records that the Archives or\r\nDORIS possesses which are already digitized but which are not yet available online, including those\r\nthat are stored on internal or external or Internet-connected hard drives, or files that would be\r\naccessible to patrons on internal networks onsite at the Archives building at 31 Chambers Street in\r\nManhattan, if there were not currently a pandemic closing public access to that reading room.\r\n\r\nFor example, these records include, but are not limited to, all of the historical New York City\r\nbirth certificates, marriage certificates, death certificates, and marriage licenses that have been recently\r\nscanned in full color and in high definition. We are aware that there may be some data gaps in this new\r\ncollection and that, in particular, not all of the records for all of the years for the New York City Clerk's\r\nOffice marriage license series have been scanned yet, but we will take what you have so far.\r\n\r\nThese records also include any historical materials that the Archives or DORIS may have\r\ndigitized internally or through a partner or vendor, where those images have not yet been published\r\nonline and/or are not available to the public onsite, but do exist on Archives or DORIS hard drives or\r\nonline storage.\r\n\r\nWe are requesting copies of all these digital images in their original formats and in their original\r\nsizes, in their full resolution, not edited, not resized, not compressed, and not watermarked \u2013 just as\r\nthey appear to the public right now on DORIS' website(s) or internal network(s) or internal hard\r\ndrive(s) or online hard drive(s). We would prefer that the images be delivered to us in TIF or TIFF\r\nformat, if possible, or in JPEG or JPG format if not. We also would like the files delivered to us in their\r\nexisting folder structure, clearly separating out each collection or sub-collection into unique folders\r\nwith recognizable folder names and file names.\r\n\r\nWe also request copies of all the metadata that goes along with these digitized images. For\r\nexample, the Archives has a database of the transcribed names and dates and places and file numbers\r\nfrom its newly scanned vital records collection. This makes it possible for Archives patrons sitting in\r\nthe Archives building at 31 Chambers Street to do a name or date or Borough search for a historical\r\nbirth, marriage, or death record, and then see each resulting digital image, or place an order for the\r\ncertified paper copy of the record, if they prefer. This database is made available on Archives\r\ncomputers through an internal DORIS network and is also available through DORIS' public WiFi, and\r\nit is freely accessible to the public to use while they are onsite, were that location not currently closed\r\ndue to the pandemic.\r\n\r\nAs another example, nearly all of the photos and images that are already online on DORIS'\r\nLuna Imaging website have text metadata included, listing information about the subjects, the\r\nlocations, the years, the original formats and sizes (etc.) of each set of digital photos or scanned\r\nmaterials. Some of those individual photographs also have unique text captions. We request all of that\r\nmetadata, too.\r\n\r\nWe would prefer that all these metadata sets or databases be sent to us in their original digital\r\ntext formats, such as SQL database export(s), CSV file(s), Microsoft Excel spreadsheet(s), etc. We\r\nwould prefer to receive the data as SQL exports, if possible. We request this data in their full and\r\nunredacted forms, including all column headers and all data dictionaries and data schemas for any\r\ndatabases, if they exist.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this FOIL request, we are not requesting copies of any of the Archives'\r\ndigitized moving picture files or digitized audio files or collections that are primarily made of video or\r\naudio files, such as the \u201cNYPD Surveillance Films\u201d collection or the \u201cWNYC: Radio, Film, and TV\u201d\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nAnd for the purposes of this FOIL request, we are also not requesting any of the recent\r\n\u201cmayoral\u201d collections, which are generally subject files and correspondence from various New York\r\nCity mayors' administrations, even though many of those are already digitized.\r\n\r\nAnd for the purposes of this FOIL request, we are also not requesting any physical microfilms.\r\n(We will be making several FOIL requests for many new microfilm-to-microfilm copies, just as we\r\nhave been doing for the past six years, but those requests will be handled separately from this request.)\r\n\r\nPlease inform us of the costs of fulfilling this request before doing so. We will expect the digital\r\nimage files and their metadata and their folder structures to be delivered to us either on physical hard\r\ndrives, for which we will pay the hardware costs and the insured and trackable domestic shipping costs,\r\nor through an online file transfer platform such as Dropbox or Box or Google Drive.\r\n\r\nShould this request not be met with prompt production of these records, please consider the\r\nrequest ongoing in nature. When production is made, please include all relevant documents which have\r\nbeen converted into an electronic format between the date of this request and the actual time of\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nAs your agency knows, we are a non-profit organization, and we will be using these documents\r\nfor non-commercial purposes. We look forward to freely publishing these millions of public records\r\nonline, without any kind of paywall or restrictions as to their use and reuse. Public records belong to\r\nthe public, and we want our records back.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your reply in the next five business days, as required by law.\r\n\r\n\r\nvery cheerfully yours,\r\n\r\nBrooke Schreier Ganz, on behalf of Reclaim The Records\r\nPresident and Founder, Reclaim The Records\r\nhttps://www.ReclaimTheRecords.org/",

Your original request was received Tuesday, June 27, 2023 and a search was initiated immediately. I have no record of a request dated June 24, 2023 (see attached original message). Additionally, please note that requests received outside of business hours (e.g., Saturday) are processed the next business day.\r\n\r\nWe are conducting a search to determine what records, if any, are responsive to the request and their status under Vermont law. Please find more information about the University\u2019s Records and Documents Requests Policy at https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/UVM-Policies/policies/records_request.pdf and on the Vermont Legislature\u2019s website here: https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/01/005/00318.\r\n\r\nI understand from the Office of Record that some or all records in the 1970 to 1990 range you request will require the recall of physical records from offsite storage and significant time to review individual files. I estimate that there will be significant time associated with reviewing the records for the information you seek. I will provide you an estimate once our initial search is complete.\r\n\r\nBelow is a link to the University of Vermont Operating Procedure related to costs associated with records requests. If you wish to revise your original request to potentially reduce costs, you would then be welcome to submit follow up requests. Please let me know if you have any questions; my direct contact information is below.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/UVM-Policies/policies/cost_assessment.pdf\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMaureen\r\nMaureen Jennings\r\nRecords Custodian & Compliance Coordinator\r\nOffice of Compliance and Privacy Services\r\nUniversity of Vermont\r\nP: 802.656.3415<tel:802.656.3086> (direct) / E: public.records@uvm.edu<mailto:public.records@uvm.edu>\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS INFORMATION<https://www.uvm.edu/compliance/public-records>\r\nOffice of Compliance & Privacy Services<https://www.uvm.edu/compliance>     \u2022     Feedback, Comments, Questions<mailto:compliance@uvm.edu?subject=Feedback,%20Comments,%20Questions>\r\n\r\n********************CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE********************\r\nThis e-mail and any attachments may contain private, confidential, and privileged information for the sole use of the intended recipient.

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools. \r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and, \r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b). \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlisha Patel",

Upon reviewing many of the records you quested appear to be prohibited from being released. However, I would like to help you obtain as many records as I am legally able to release. I am very interested in your query of juvenile records from the schools concerning arrests and incidents. I hope your going to publish this information so we can better understand the significance of juvenile related arrests in schools. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNevertheless, I would be able to export the existing CAD juvenile incidents related to juveniles at schools. Please understand that our department policy discourages any arrests made within the schools, unless immediate life safety is directly involved. I feel the school administration, and/or the child\u2019s parents can better serve as the disciplinary than the criminal justice system.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlthough, I will not be able to release the juvenile incident reports, I would be able to release the CAD information for those calls for service. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you would like the CAD information. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKyle P.

These notification reports document instances in which Louisville Metro Police personnel have reached out to Shotspotter for support, perhaps because the system failed to detect a shooting or misclassified an incident. To assist with your search, I have attached two examples of these notification reports provided by the Chicago Police Department. \r\n\r\n2) Copies of all Shotspotter responses to Louisville Metro Police notification reports filed  since January 1, 2021. Examples of Shotspotter's responses to these reports can be found in the attached records provided by CPD.\r\n\r\nI ask that all fees be waived as I am a journalist and intend to use the requested records to further the public's understanding of core government functions. I do not intend to use the records for any commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employ involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed breakdown of the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\n\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMeghan Leong",

This request was originally made on August 5, 2022, and is regarding copies of signed and notarized oaths of office for certain district employees and contractors from October 15, 2017, until the date the request is fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIt has been nearly ten months since my initial request and despite numerous assurances, it remains unfulfilled. This is deeply concerning and unacceptable. The New York Freedom of Information Law enshrines the public's right to access governmental records promptly, and your office's continuous delays seem to be in direct violation of this law.\r\n\r\nThese documents, as oaths of office for public service roles, should be readily available and not require extensive retrieval efforts. My request is specific and focused, and therefore, there should be no need to narrow the scope to expedite the process.\r\n\r\nYour office's repeated and unjustifiable delays undermine the public's right to access crucial information. This does not only breach the principles of the FOIL, but it also diminishes the transparency and accountability that should be inherent within any public-serving institution.\r\n\r\nI must insist on your urgent and immediate attention to this matter. Please provide a definitive and final deadline by which my request will be fulfilled, not an anticipated one. This pattern of delay and lack of follow-through is not acceptable and it is my expectation that my request will be honored as required by law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I trust your office will uphold the standards of transparency and accountability expected of it.",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

I will need time to review the records and provide a cost estimate.\r\nEven once I provide the cost estimate, and you pay the deposit, this request will take a significant amount of time to produce as all records will have to be reviewed and redacted. When I provide the cost estimate I will also provide an updated time estimate.  This request will require multiple installments.  I will provide a cost and updated time estimate by December 19, 2022.\r\n\r\n****Your email indicated you declined using a 3rd party \u2018portal\u2019.\r\nDue to the size of these documents, they would need to be provided through the Auburn School District Microsoft SharePoint. If this doesn\u2019t work for you, they could be provided on a digital storage media (CD) or in hard copy at an additional cost. This confirmation email indicates below all delivery options and state allowable pricing.  Please advise your preference within ten (10) business days (December 19, 2022).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo view the procedure and costs associated with Public Records click Board Policy 4040P<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q0g-_-8x8bM__8Wuj8NkR1x7R5XMUMDU> .

The customized service charge may reimburse the District up to the actual cost of providing the services.\r\n  *   The District may choose to not calculate the actual costs it charges for providing public records if doing so would be unduly burdensome.\r\n  *   The District may waive any charge assess for a request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf requested, the District will provide a summary of the applicable charges before fulfilling the request. The requestor will be allowed to revise the request in order to reduce the applicable charges, A deposit of up to ten percent of the estimated costs may be required before processing the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above timeframes are simply estimates and processing your request may take longer than predicted.

Per your request, these response documents are not included.\r\n**NOTE: PRR #2021-007 - This request was from a parent for student classwork. On January 16, 2023, MuckRock removed PRR #2021-007 from the request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first and second installment on your public records request are available. The first two installments include all responsive records except for the six public records requests that need redacting. All remaining materials will be included in installment three (3).\r\n\r\nThe district uses SharePoint to deliver response documents.\r\nYour documents are stored in a SharePoint folder.  I have just shared that folder with you.\r\n\r\nYou will receive an email directly from SharePoint to the folder with your files.\r\nYou will then go through a short process to get an access code from SharePoint. That code will come in a second email from SharePoint to you.  If you do not receive the email right away, please check your spam folder.\r\n\r\n**Please review your documents within thirty (30) days.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021.\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2021 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\n**The fourth installment on your public records request is available.\r\n\r\n**I am not able to complete the full request by the original time estimate of April 10, 2023. There are still two public records requests that are student related that need to be reviewed and provided. I believe the 5th installment will include all remaining items.\r\n\r\nSharePoint\r\nThe district uses SharePoint to deliver response documents.\r\nYour documents are stored in a SharePoint folder.  I have just shared that folder with you.\r\n\r\nYou will receive an email directly from SharePoint to the folder with your files.\r\nYou will then go through a short process to get an access code from SharePoint. That code will come in a second email from SharePoint to you.  If you do not receive the email right away, please check your spam folder.\r\n\r\n**Please review your documents within thirty (30) days. Per RCW 42.56.120(4), if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have trouble or if you have additional questions.\r\n\r\nAt any time that you no longer need the requested information in your public records request, please let me know.\r\nI will provide an update or the next installment on or before May 16, 2023.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLisa Connors\r\nPublic Records and Compliance Coordinator\r\nAuburn School District\r\n\r\nD: 253-887-3955\r\nP: 253-931-4900\r\nE: lconnors@auburn.wednet.edu<mailto:lconnors@auburn.wednet.edu>\n915 4th Street NE, Auburn, WA 98002\r\nwww.auburn.wednet.edu<http://www.auburn.wednet.edu/>",

The operation, initiated in 1944, aimed to establish airfields in China that could support B-29 Superfortress bombers in their strikes against Japan.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nOfficial military reports, planning documents, and after-action reviews related to Operation Matterhorn.\r\nCommunications, memos, or letters involving military commanders and personnel discussing the planning, execution, and aftermath of Operation Matterhorn.\r\nAny photographs, maps, or other visual materials produced or collected during the operation.\r\nRecords of any investigations, inquiries, or tribunals associated with Operation Matterhorn.\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Your request\r\nconcerns Operation Matterhorn during World War II.\r\n\r\nOur office handles FOIA and Privacy Act requests for NARA\u2019s operational records\r\n(records created by this agency).  Because your FOIA request is for records\r\nthat may be archival records (records created by or originated in a\r\ndifferent agency but that may have been transferred to the legal custody of\r\nNARA), we are forwarding it by this email to our Office of Research\r\nServices, Textual Reference (RR2RR) staff who handle FOIA requests for\r\ntextual archival records.\r\n\r\nThat office will assign your request a tracking number and respond directly\r\nto you.

Your request was received in this office on 6/13/23 and\r\nassigned FOIA tracking number 23-47523.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to maps, charts, and plans relating to Operation\r\nMatterhorn. While we don't hold records specific to Operation Matterhorn,\r\nwe hold two main series of records that might prove useful to your research.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first series is in our Record Group 18, Records of the Army Air Forces.\r\nWe hold a series of World Aeronautical Charts that would have been used at\r\nthe time in the planning and execution of offensive bombing missions. These\r\ncharts are filed by WAC number, and we'll attach scans for charts 377 and\r\n378, which cover western Japan. We'll also include a copy of the back of\r\none of the sheets, which includes information on interpreting the chart and\r\nan index with the other WAC numbers. Those charts are open and available\r\nfor use; if you visit the archives you can pull them with the citation \"RG\r\n18: WAC Charts, [WAC #].\" You can see the description for that series\r\nonline via our catalog at https://catalog.archives.gov/id/649649.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also hold a series of Air Objective Folders that include specific\r\ninformation on various bombing targets. Each subject in that series was\r\nassigned a target number by the air force, and the records are filed by\r\nthat number. We'll attach a finding aid that lists the target numbers for\r\nthe objectives we hold. These objective folders include maps and\r\nphotographs of the target areas, as well as textual descriptions about the\r\nnature of each target. These records are also available for use and can be\r\npulled using the citation \"RG 18: Air Objective Folders, [Objective #].\"\r\nYou can see the description for that series online via our catalog at\r\nhttps://catalog.archives.gov/id/6050528.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs reviewed under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act, there are no\r\nrestrictions on access and these records are open and available for\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes the processing of your request. If you have additional\r\nquestions concerning my review of these records, please contact me directly\r\nat ryan.mcpherson@nara.gov.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with my action on this request, you have the right\r\nto file an administrative appeal within ninety (90) calendar days from the\r\ndate of this letter. Appeals must be in writing and may be delivered by\r\nregular U.S. mail or by e-mail.

Your request was received in this office on June\r\n12, 2023 and has been assigned the FOIA Case Number 23-49013.\r\n\r\nYour request indicated that you are interested in photographs of Operation\r\nMatterhorn, an effort to establish strategic bombing operations within\r\nChina and India during World War II.\r\n\r\nWe conducted a search within the Records of U.S. Air Force Commands,\r\nActivities, and Organizations (Record Group 342) and have located many\r\nrelated photographs within the series of records 342-FH\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/542351>. You can find digitized\r\nphotographs on our online catalog indexed under \u201cMatterhorn\u201d at the\r\nfollowing link:\r\nhttps://catalog.archives.gov/search-within/542351?q=Matterhorn. Please note\r\nthat a portion of this series is not yet digitized; however, it is open and\r\navailable to view in our Research Room.\r\n\r\nWe also conducted a search within the Records of the Office of the Chief\r\nSignal Officer (Record Group 111). While we did not locate responsive\r\nrecords within our main series of photographs, 111-SC\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/530707>, directly under the term\r\n\u201cMatterhorn Project/Operation\u201d or \u201cXX Bomber Command,\u201d the series contains\r\nnumerous photographs related to the China-Burma-India (CBI) Theater of\r\nOperations during World War II. It is possible images are indexed under a\r\ndifferent term, topic, or subject. It can often take in-depth searching of\r\nour holdings in order to find a specific topic. Moreover, there could often\r\nbe numerous photographs indexed under a specific unit, geographic location,\r\netc., and it would take a considerable amount of time to review each\r\nindividual photograph. You can find related albums of photographs in our\r\nseries 111-SCA <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/531473> organized by\r\ngeographic locations that may be of interest. We have included links to the\r\ndescriptions of these albums below.\r\n\r\n*111-SCA, Indexed under \u201cChina\u201d:*\r\nhttps://catalog.archives.gov/search-within/531473?q=China\r\n*111-SCA, Indexed under \u201cIndia\u201d:*\r\nhttps://catalog.archives.gov/search-within/531473?q=India\r\n\r\nLastly, we also conducted a review of the records within Records of the\r\nOffice of War Information (Record Group 208). Specifically, the series of\r\nrecords 208-MO <https://catalog.archives.gov/id/535762> and 208-AA\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/535523> have numerous file units related\r\nto the CBI Theater. As mentioned above, it may take substantial review of\r\nthese records to identify related images. We have attached a finding aid\r\nfor 208-MO, as well as included links below to the file units within 208-AA\r\nrelevant to your search.\r\n\r\n*208-AA, Indexed under \u201cChina\u201d:*\r\nhttps://catalog.archives.gov/search-within/535523?q=China\r\n*208-AA, Indexed under \u201cIndia\u201d:*\r\nhttps://catalog.archives.gov/search-within/535523?q=India\r\n\r\nAll of the records related to your request and listed above are open and\r\navailable to view within our Research Room. We invite you or a\r\nrepresentative to visit us in College Park, Maryland to review and make\r\ncopies. If you would like to schedule a Still Picture Research Room\r\nappointment, please visit\r\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/o/national-archives-at-college-park-still-pictures-48193105693,\r\nand you may email consultation.stillpix@nara.gov with any questions.\r\nAlternatively if you are unable to visit, you may wish to hire an\r\nindependent researcher to search for and copy images on your behalf.\r\n\r\nThis completes the processing of your request. If you have any questions,\r\nthe Still Picture Reference Team will be happy to assist you.  Written\r\ninquiries may be directed to the Still Picture Reference Team, RRSS, Room\r\n5360, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road,\r\nCollege Park, Maryland 20740-6001.

However, if you are\r\nnot satisfied with our action on this request, your options for appeal and\r\ndispute resolution are outlined in the attached document.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSarah Bseirani\r\nStill Picture Branch (RRSS)\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration",

As of June 6, 2023, I have not received any further communication or the requested records.\r\n\r\nAs per Section 89(4)(a) of the Public Officers Law, if access to records is neither granted nor denied within ten business days of the acknowledgment of the receipt of a request, this may be construed as a denial of access that may be appealed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am appealing the denial of access to the requested records. I kindly request that you review this appeal and make a determination within ten business days, as required by Section 89(4)(a) of the Public Officers Law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.",

Any policy, guidance, handbook, manual, or standard contract concerning the institution\u2019s interactions or relationship with members of the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\n2. Any policy, guidance, handbook, or manual concerning the interactions or communications of institutional employees, including faculty, administrators, staff, and student employees, with the news media, reporters, or journalists, including student journalists. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not seek a search of faculty or student email accounts or records. These requests should in no way be construed to include a review or search of email accounts, websites, or other forms of data or document retention which are controlled by students, alumni, or faculty members, nor by governmental or advisory bodies controlled by the same, except insofar as any such individuals also serve in an administrative capacity and the records were created or are held by the individual in that capacity. Any search should be limited to documents held by the administration and/or its staff members, including records created or maintained by persons acting in the capacity of administrators or staff members.\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that aims to defend and sustain the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. This request concerns a matter of public interest. The records are sought for the purpose of researching and educating the public about policies affecting student journalists' ability to engage in news gathering and reporting on college and university campuses.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by 1 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 408(6). The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnne Marie Tamburro",
