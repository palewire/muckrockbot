LEGAL BASIS AND PRECEDENT\r\nThis request is made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f552 and is supported by the following legal authorities and judicial precedents, which mandate exhaustive and complete searches for all relevant documents:\r\n\r\nDepartment of Justice v.

Federal Trade Commission, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015) and Carney v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814 (2d Cir. 1994), support fee waivers for requests that enhance governmental transparency.\r\nIf fees are expected to exceed $100, please contact me prior to proceeding further.\r\n\r\nVII.

This includes ensuring that all electronic files retain their original metadata and that no automated deletion or archival processes alter or destroy the relevant records.\r\n\r\nIX. VAUGHN INDEX REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the responsive records is withheld or redacted, I request a complete Vaughn index that:\r\n\r\nLists each document withheld or redacted with specificity.\r\nIdentifies the exact statutory exemption(s) claimed.\r\nProvides a detailed explanation of how each exemption justifies the withholding, including an analysis of the potential harm from disclosure.\r\nDiscloses any segregable portions that can be released.\r\n\r\nX. ADMINISTRATIVE TRACKING AND SEARCH DOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\nIn compliance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f552(a)(6)(A)(i) and relevant case law, please include with your response:\r\n\r\nThe tracking number assigned to this request.\r\nThe name(s) of the FOIA personnel responsible for processing this request.\r\nA detailed description of the search methodology employed, including all systems, databases, repositories, and local storage locations searched.\r\nThe exact search terms used (including Boolean operators and any modifications).\r\nDate ranges for each search.\r\nDocumentation of personnel involved and the time spent on each search.\r\nCopies or summaries of search logs, including timestamps and result counts.\r\nCertification by the designated Information Management Officer that all potentially responsive records were searched.\r\n\r\nXI.

PREVIOUS EVIDENCE OF INTERACTION\r\n\r\nThere is extensive, independently documented evidence of interactions between U.S. Border Patrol personnel and militia groups. Specifically:\r\n\r\nSouthern Poverty Law Center Report: In Plain Sight: Uncovering Border Patrol\u2019s Relationship with Far-Right Militias at the Southern Border (\u200b\r\nSPLCENTER.ORG\r\n) details multiple instances of such interactions in Arizona.\r\nWIRED Report: Border Militias Prepare to Assist With Donald Trump\u2019s Mass Deportation Plans (\u200b\r\nWIRED.COM\r\n) describes contacts between militia groups like Arizona Border Recon and federal officials.\r\nAdditional Investigative Reports: Articles from the Los Angeles Times and TIME (\u200b\r\nLATIMES.COM\r\n; \r\nTIME.COM\r\n) corroborate historical and ongoing patterns of informal cooperation or tacit approval between Border Patrol personnel, local law enforcement, and vigilante groups.\r\nThese independent sources establish a clear pattern of interaction that underscores the public interest in obtaining full disclosure of the requested records.\r\n\r\nXIII. SUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENTATION AND SUBSTATION RECORDS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records explicitly described above, please produce any supplementary or \u201csubstation\u201d records that are relevant to the processing of this request.

If any portion of this request is unclear or if additional information is required, please contact me immediately. I further request that no delay tactics or improper denials be employed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt, full, and legally compliant disclosure of these records.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nInvestigative Journalist",

On Tuesday, April 23rd of 2013, the Twitter account of the Associated Press was taken over by hackers who sent out tweets claiming that the White House had been struck by two bomb blasts and that President Obama had been injured. \r\n\r\nCoverage of this event can be read here: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/23/ap-tweet-hack-wall-street-freefall\r\n\r\nThese hoax tweets contributed to a 143 point drop in the Dow Jones and highlighted the dangers of hoaxes in markets that rely on high frequency trading. The hoax and their aftermath was commented upon by Jay Carney that day and led the broadcast channel newscasts that evening. This incident has been described as an early example of social media disinformation impacting markets and the public. \r\n\r\nPlease search for materials related to the immediate reaction to those hoax tweets on April 23rd of 2013, as well as continued discussion in the weeks afterward as to their impact. For purposes of this request please limit the search for documents created between April 23rd 2013 and July 23rd 2013.

A copy of any version of the \u201cBias Incident Reporting\u201d form (the \u201cForm\u201d) used by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights since January 1, 2020.\r\n\r\n2. Policies, guides, manuals, memoranda, or training materials provided to any staff member or volunteer tasked with receiving, handling, or responding to any report submitted through the Form since January 1, 2020. \r\n\r\n3. Any statistics, annual reports (or other periodic reports), or synopses of complaints, incidents, or responses concerning \u201cbias incidents\u201d (or the processing thereof) submitted through the Form since January 1, 2020.\r\n\r\n4. Any report submitted through the Form since January 1, 2020. \r\n\r\n5. If the Form\u2019s reporting system is associated with a database, any copies of database entries related to the Form reporting and any records maintained in accordance with the operation of the database since January 1, 2020. \r\n\r\n\u201cDocument\u201d means any record consisting of handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, photocopying, transmitting by electronic mail or facsimile, and every other means of recording upon any tangible thing, any form of communication or representation, including letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combinations thereof, and any record thereby created, regardless of the manner in which the record has been stored. \r\n\r\nThe names, phone numbers, and mailing address of persons other than government employees or officials should be redacted from any responsive documents. \r\n\r\nI request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying the responsive records. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to defending, preserving, and extending civil liberties. The records sought herein are not sought for a commercial purpose. As discussed in greater detail below, release of the information requested will further the public\u2019s understanding of the City of Eden Prairie\u2019s efforts to address the concerns of its citizens with respect to social issues, as well as the Minnesota Department of Human Rights' policies and practices regarding offensive speech and its citizens\u2019 First Amendment rights. The purposes of the Minnesota Data Practices Act will be furthered by a waiver of costs because the documents requested will contribute substantially to the public\u2019s understanding of how government officials implement policies relating to offensive speech, and whether those efforts and policies are consistent with the First Amendment.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any portion, or all, of this request, please provide me with a written explanation of the reason(s) for your denial, including a citation to each specific statutory exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. If you conclude that portions of the records that I request are exempt from disclosure, please release the remainder of such records for inspection and copying, redacting only the portion or portions that you claim are exempt. For any exemptions, please note whether it is discretionary and, if so, the basis for refusing to exercise discretion in favor of granting access.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

This request is related to the incident involving a school bus where the suspect allegedly blocked the vehicle, resisted officers, and was tased:\r\n\r\n3/30/2023, around 3:45 pm, officers were sent to W. Matlock and N. 8th Street for a vehicle blocking the pathway of an APISD school bus. While officers were on their way, the information updated to state a female pedestrian was standing in front of the school bus preventing it from continuing its route. The bus was occupied by several students under the age of 17 and two adult employees of the ISD.  \r\n\r\nEVENT #23-7398, UNLAWFUL RESTRAINT \u2013 SCHOOL BUS\r\n\r\nBody-worn camera footage from all responding officers involved in the arrest.\r\nIncident reports and arrest reports regarding this case.\r\nDashcam footage from any patrol units that responded to the scene.\r\nRear-seat police vehicle footage (if applicable) from the unit that transported the suspect following her arrest.\r\nThis request seeks essential records documenting the suspect\u2019s alleged unlawful restraint of the bus, resistance to arrest, and harassment of an officer (spitting on police). If any 911 calls or additional footage (such as school bus surveillance) exist, I request them only if they provide additional relevant details.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nI request a waiver of all fees as the release of these records serves the public interest by contributing to transparency in law enforcement actions and public safety matters, rather than for personal or commercial gain.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in digital format via email or through a secure online portal if available. If any associated costs apply, please notify me before processing. If any portion of this request is denied or redacted, please cite the specific legal exemption under Texas law that justifies the denial.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance. Please confirm receipt of this request at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
