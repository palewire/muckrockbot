Requests for Records\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 1: All documents constituting, reflecting, relating to, or containing current use policies for each type of 1033 Program controlled equipment, including policies specifying circumstances in which use is authorized or prohibited.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 2: Records listing the dates, locations, suspected offense(s) or rationale for operation, controlled equipment deployed, arrests made, and uses of force associated with each deployment of 1033 Program controlled equipment since May 1, 2019. This includes armored vehicles (such as MRAPs), firearms, and night vision equipment.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 3: All complaints, correspondence, visual or audiovisual materials, and agency responses relating to the use and impact of 1033 Program controlled equipment.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 4: Documents reflecting or relating to the rationale, justification, or criteria for acquisition of 1033 Program controlled equipment prior to its acquisition.\r\n\r\nII. Response Time\r\n\r\nUnder ORS 192.329, agencies must respond to public records requests within five (5) business days to acknowledge receipt of the request, and within an additional ten (10) business days to complete the request or provide a written statement explaining the estimated time required to comply.\r\n\r\nIf the requested records are available, I ask that they be released on a rolling basis as they are located, rather than waiting for all materials to be compiled.\r\n\r\nIII. Fees and Public Interest Waiver\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKate Bertash",
