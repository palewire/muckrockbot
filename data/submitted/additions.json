        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe ICE Detainee Death Report regarding Salvador Vargas, 61, who ICE says died April 7, 2023, after being imprisoned at CoreCivic\u2019s Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, which has housed 10 people for ICE who have died in the past 6 years. https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/noncitizen-ice-custody-passes-away-georgia-hospital\r\n\r\nWe make this request as a demand for affirmative disclosure under 5 USC 552(a)(2)(D), as well as under 5 USC 552(a)(3) as a demand for prompt access to information. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request \r\nWe make this request for expedited processing pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), and provide the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\nICE is under a mandatory obligation, set forth in congressional appropriations language, to post the Death Death Report within 30 days of Mr. Vargas\u2019s death. Detainee deaths have been the subject of widespread media attention culminating in congressional action, including the mandatory reporting requirements ICE itself describes. https://www.ice.gov/detain/detainee-death-reporting. ICE is currently violating that law by allotting itself 90 days instead of 30. The purpose of the Death Report publication requirement is to ensure Congress and the public have information about deaths in custody. Access to timely, complete, and accurate information allows the public to take protective actions and advocate policies that could reduce these deaths. For instance, public outcry over in-custody deaths resulted in Congress ordering the DHS Office of Inspector General to conduct an annual review of ICE and CBP in-custody deaths to determine if any systemic issues contributed to those tragedies and make recommendations about how to address those issues. See https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-02/OIG-23-12-Feb23.pdf. \r\n\r\nAs of the date of this request - May 11, 2023 - ICE is in violation of the 30-day Death Report publication requirement. This means the ICE detention system is violating the Anti-Deficiency Act, and ICE leaders are potentially subject to civil and criminal penalties. \r\n\r\nPlease grant this request expedited processing and bring ICE into compliance by posting the detainee death report for Mr. Vargas on ICE\u2019s FOIA reading room, or supplying it to the #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative so that we may post it publicly. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

certify under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct to the best of our knowledge and understanding: \r\nThe subject of the records at issue - ICE deaths in custody - has been the subject of substantial and widespread media coverage about which there exist significant questions as to the agency\u2019s conduct. Multiple federal courts have held ICE broke the law by failing to timely respond to requests about in-custody deaths, including the courts in Transgender Law Center v. ICE (NDCal/CA9), Innovation Law Lab v. ICE (DNM), and Owen v. ICE (CD Cal). As the folks in charge of IHSC, Smith and Rivera are the IHSC officials with the most (a) institutional knowledge about deaths in ICE custody born of long-term, mandatory reports made to or by them about deaths in custody; and (b) individual responsibility in his respective roles within the agency for preventing preventable deaths. Archiving these officials\u2019 emails for historians and experts to understand their response to 58 deaths in custody, and making these records available to those opposing expansion of the carceral apparatus by ICE in the present moment are essential to preventing another 58 losses of human life in ICE custody in the years to come. \r\n\r\nPattern and Practice Injunction Advisal \r\nIn August 2021, our project wrote ICE\u2019s FOIA leaders a letter calling attention to an extensive pattern and practice of failing to timely acknowledge FOIA requests, process them for determinations within statutory timeframes, and make records promptly available. We received no response. In January 2023, the US District Court for the Central District of California declared ICE has an unlawful pattern and practice of failing to timely respond to FOIA requests, and entered judgment in favor of families from whom ICE withheld records about deaths in custody for years. We know you are unlikely to acknowledge this request, assign it an individualized tracking number, make a timely determination about whether to grant or deny it, and make these records available promptly, and on an expedited basis. You are unlikely to have read this far until this request is attached to a federal lawsuit. But if that is the necessary means to enforce this request, we respectfully advise you that the Court in Owen v. ICE (CD Cal) has already said \u201cIt should not take a lawsuit for an agency to comply with FOIA.\u201d If the agency, after having judgment entered against it for FOIA noncompliance in a lawsuit that should never have been necessary in the first place, cannot bring itself into compliance with FOIA\u2019s timelines, we will invite the Court to do so through an injunction. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response,  \r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",
