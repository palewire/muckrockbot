        "communication": "This is a request for a mandatory declassification review (MDR), under the terms of section 3.5 of E.O. 13526, seeking the following documents:\r\n\r\nAudio-visual recordings (\"recordings\") of the sensors from the unmanned aerial vehicles (henceforth \"UAV's\") for the targeted operation credited with the killing of Ayman al-Zawahiri, on July 31, 2022 in  Kabul, Afghanistan (\"the operation\"), as well as recordings of communications among participants in the operation. \r\n\r\nPlease note:\r\n\u2022 Video recordings may be in multiple varieties, such as different light spectra (e.g., visible light spectrum recordings from an electro-optical sensor vs. recordings of video shot from an infrared camera). All of these are of interest and should be provided in separate video files where possible.\r\n\u2022 While recordings from the sensors of the MQ-9 Reaper drone publicly credited with the launch of missiles is of interest, I also request any footage from any separate UAV's in the operation (e.g., an Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance UAV used to observe the area immediately before and after the strike).\r\n\u2022 Any audio-video recordings from communications related to the recordings (for instance, audio of pilots and sensor operators coordinating) should also be released.\r\n\r\nI am requesting this review and release because I believe it contains information that is of public interest and does not pose a threat to national security if released.\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this request and provide an estimated timetable for the review. If you have any questions or need additional information, please contact me at this email address.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nT. McElwee",
