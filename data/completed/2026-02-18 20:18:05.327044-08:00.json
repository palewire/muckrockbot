I apologize for not having been able to locate these records on your website myself initially. \r\n\r\nBut I'm just following up now because unfortunately I still cannot locate the CVR data on your webpage. Really sorry about this - I've spent a lot of time at the link you provided looking for CVR data of any kind but have had no luck. I am attaching a screenshot of what the page returns when I search for just the 2024 General election.  In the screenshot you can see that under \"Data Exports\" only the precinct level returns are available to download across all formats (pdf, csv, html). These data provide just the vote totals by office and precinct. I don't see anything about CVR records anywhere, including under the advanced search. I have also attached the CSV file that is output when I click \"Precinct Results\" just for your reference in case it is helpful.\r\n\r\nMy sincerest apologies for the hassle with this. I am trying my hardest to locate the records myself on your website but I have just been unable to find what you describe in this email. I would be extremely remiss to create additional work for you but I am at a loss. I hope you understand, and thank you very much again for your time and patience. \r\n\r\nAll my best,\r\nAleksandra Conevska ",

Your request was received in this office January 28, 2026, and assigned control number 2026-FSA-02533-F. Please use this control number for all future communications regarding this request.\r\n\u200b\r\nWe are unable to begin processing your request at this time because we cannot determine precisely which records you are seeking.  In your request form, you state that you are requesting\r\n\u200b\r\n\"the 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 applications to receive subsidies under the programs: Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), Milk Loss Program (MLP), Dairy Indemnity Payment Program (DIPP) for the following producers: * Varel Dairy; Bartelso, Illinois. * Thole AG; Aviston, Illinois. * JB Timmermann Farms; Breese, Illinois.* Four Beck Dairy; Bartleso, Illinois. * C D & R Farms, Inc.; Breese, Illinois.* Dall Dairy; Aviston, Illinois * Glen Von Bokel Farms; Carlyle, Illinois * Aaron Hilmes; Carlyle, Illinois * Corey Hilmes; Breese, Illinois * Arentsen Farms; Albers, Illinois\u201d\r\n\u200b\r\nHowever, we need to confirm whether you have written consent from the producer(s)/entity(ies) listed above to receive unredacted copies of their DMC, MLP and DIPP applications?  If yes, please provide a copy of the consent by replying to this email.  If not, are you willing to receive redacted versions of these documents instead?\r\n\r\nWe cannot proceed further with your request until we receive additional written clarification from you.  Please note that if we do not hear from you within 20 business days from the date of this email, we will assume that you are no longer interested in pursuing your request and we will administratively close your request.\r\n\r\nIn your letter, you requested a fee waiver. You were placed in the \u201cMedia Use\u201d requester category, as such all fees are waived.\r\n\r\nIn your letter, you also requested expedited processing of your request. According to USDA regulations at Title 7, CFR 1.9(b), it is the policy of FSA to grant a request for expedited processing whenever the requester demonstrates that the request involves:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual or\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by an individual primarily engaged in disseminating information\r\n\r\nYou state that you are requesting expedited processing of your request, because there is an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity, however, your letter did not provide an adequate justification to support your argument.  Therefore, we are processing your request on a \u201cfirst in, first out\u201d basis in the complex track.\r\n\r\nIf you believe the determination to deny your request for expedited processing is incorrect, you may appeal to the FSA Administrator.  The Appeals and Litigation Staff must receive your written appeal within ninety (90) calendar days of the date of this letter.  Please include in the appeal a brief explanation of why you believe this decision is in error.  Be sure to include a copy of your initial request letter in your appeal package.

        "communication": "Ms. Hundsdorfer,\r\n\r\nThis responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request dated January 26, 2026, which was received in this office on January 28, 2026, and assigned control number 2026-FSA-02533-F.\r\n\r\nIn response to your request, we located the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) documents for Varel Dairy, Thole AG, JB Timermann Farms, Four Beck Dairy, C D & R Farms, Dall Dairy, Aaron Hilmes and Corey Hilmes, comprising of 80 pages.  With respect to these pages, we are releasing 8 pages in full,  72 pages redacted in part, and zero (0) pages withheld in full, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) and (b)(6) of the FOIA.\r\n\r\nElectronic copies have been sent as attachments to this email.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the portion of your request for DMC, Milk Loss Program (MLP), and Dairy Indemnity Payment Program (DIPP) documents for Glen Von Bokel Farms and Arentsen Farms, a comprehensive search was conducted for the records you seek, however no responsive records were found.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the portion of your request for MLP documents for Varel Dairy,  Thole AG, JB Timmermann Farms, Four Beck Dairy, C D & R Farms, Inc, Dall Dairy, Aaron Hilmes, and Corey Hilmes, a comprehensive search was conducted for the records you seek, however no responsive records were found.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the portion of your request for DIPP documents for Varel Dairy, Thole AG, JB Timmermann Farms, Four Beck Dairy, C D & R Farms,  Dall Dairy, Aaron Hilmes and Corey Hilmes, a comprehensive search was conducted for the records you seek, however no responsive records were found.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the portion of your request for 2020 DMC documents for Varel Dairy, Thole AG, JB Timmermann Farms, Four Beck Dairy, and Corey Hilmes, a comprehensive search was conducted for the records you seek, however no responsive records were found.\r\n\r\nExemption 3 -- 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3): protects information included in FSA's records specifically exempted from disclosure by another Federal Statute.\r\n\r\nPursuant to exemption 3, 72 pages have been withheld in part.\r\n\r\nIn this instance Section 1619(b) of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 (7 USC \u00a7 8791), prohibits disclosing the information requested.\r\n\r\nThe records you have requested include information that FSA has obtained from agricultural producers or landowners that concerns their farming or agricultural operation, including production and marketing of agricultural commodities and livestock, farming practices, conservation practices or the land itself.  The type of information withheld includes producer address, dairy operation number, share percentage, production history, coverage level, phone number and email address. This information is required to be provided to FSA for the agricultural producers and/or landowners shown on these records to participate in FSA's farm programs.\r\n\r\nExemption 6 -- 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6): Exemption 6 protects personal information affecting an individual's privacy.\r\n\r\nPursuant to exemption 6, 72 pages have been withheld in part.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, exemption 6 protects personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. The courts have held that the phrase \"similar files\" involves all information that applies to a particular person. When disclosure of information about particular individuals is requested, the courts have decided that it is necessary for us to determine whether release of the information would constitute a clearly \"unwarranted\" invasion of the individuals' privacy. To make this determination, we are required to perform a \"balancing test.\" This means that we must weigh the individual's right to privacy against the public's right to disclosure. In this instance, we have determined that the disclosure of this information would shed little or no light on the performance of the agency's statutory duties and that, on balance; the public interest to be served by its disclosure does not outweigh the privacy interest of the individuals in question, in withholding it. The records withheld under this exemption are producer address, dairy operation number, share percentage, production history, coverage level, phone number and email address.\r\n\r\nIf you believe our decision to withhold this information is incorrect, you may appeal to the FSA Administrator. The Appeals and Litigation Division must receive your written appeal within ninety (90) calendar days of the date of this letter.  Please include in the appeal a brief explanation of why you believe this decision is in error.  Be sure to include a copy of your initial request letter in your appeal package.

The requester seeks the complete A-file and all USCIS records concerning an Emory University F-1, J-1, and M-1 nonimmigrant students (SEVIS-tracked) student whose SEVIS record was terminated without notice between 2015 and the present. The requester\u2019s identity and A-number are withheld to protect privacy and safety, but the requester is the subject of the records and expressly consents to disclosure to the filing organization for immediate forwarding to the requester.\r\nRequested records:\r\n1.\tThe complete Alien File (A-file), including all electronic records. \r\n2.\tAll Forms I-20, reinstatement applications (I-539), OPT/CPT approvals or denials, and related correspondence. \r\n3.\tAll internal USCIS communications with Emory University, its DSOs, SEVP, or ICE regarding the requester\u2019s SEVIS-tracked nonimmigrant status or SEVIS termination. \r\n4.\tAny administrative record of a reinstatement decision and any entries reflecting accrual of unlawful presence.\r\nTime period: January 01, 2015 \u2013 December 18, 2025.\r\nFee waiver is requested under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) in light of due-process deprivations akin to Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), and Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). Expedited processing is requested under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(iv) due to ongoing litigation urgency and irreparable harm (Kuck Baxter v. DHS, N.D. Ga. 2025; Liu v. Noem, D.N.H. 2025).\r\nAll records received must be forwarded to the anonymous requester in full within five (5) business days of receipt, without additional redactions.\r\nThank you.\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\nMuckRock News on behalf of Anonymous Requester\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nneutralrequest47",

As a result, we\r\nwill require several additional weeks to prepare a complete cost estimate.\r\nWhile our standard practice is to provide a quote within five business days,\r\nthe scope of this request far exceeds typical volume. We are committed to\r\nfulfilling your request and ensuring timely access to contextual records such\r\nas video and photographs; however, providing every single responsive file would\r\nrequire extensive redaction work estimated at over $3,000 and several months of\r\nprocessing. To expedite access, please let us know if you are agreeable to\r\nlimiting the scope of this request to files that will still provide you with\r\nkey details, photos, and video. \r\nIf you agree, we will provide you with your cost by January\r\n15th, 2025. Once the deposit is received, we do anticipate it will take\r\napproximately 3\u20134 months to complete redactions, as we would need to work this\r\ncase into our regular caseload due to the amount of responsive items.

All departmental or municipal policies regarding communication and information sharing between departmental officers or employees and federal agents/agencies within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including but not limited to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The records request includes, but is not limited to, policies regarding: \r\n\r\nA. Fingerprint and other data sharing, \r\n\r\nB. ICE detainer requests,   \r\n\r\nC. Compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including guidance or policies around when communication with ICE officers is allowed, and \r\n\r\nD. Communicating with federal immigration enforcement officers. \r\n\r\nThis request covers any policies that are currently in effect or that have been in effect at any point on or after January 20, 2025. \r\n\r\n2. The five most recent communications (e.g., emails, text messages, call logs or transcripts, or otherwise) between a departmental officer or employee and a federal DHS or ICE employee concerning immigration matters. In addition, I request all records related to these communications, including, but not limited to, any records indicating that the department was made aware of the communications, discussions of their content or implications, evaluations them for compliance with departmental or other city policies, identification or acknowledgement of any potential policy violations, and any internal responses, disciplinary actions, or follow-up measures resulting from these communications. \r\n\r\n3. All records relating to incidents, if any, from January 20, 2025, to the day this request is responded to, in which an individual was taken from the department\u2019s custody directly into ICE custody. For each incident, the records request includes, but is not limited to, booking and transfer records, communications with ICE or other federal agencies, internal documentation or discussion of the transfer, and internal notes, memos, or documentation referencing communication with DHS or ICE.\r\n\r\nFor each request, I am not seeking identifying information, and I will accept anonymized or redacted data as necessary to protect identities. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. I expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff \r\n\r\nJoshuadankoff@cfjj.org  \r\n\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives \r\n\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice  \r\n\r\n(submitted via MuckRock platform)",

Including final ticket sales and event costs, if available.\r\nCSU has conducted a reasonable search for these records under California Government Code \u00a77922.535 and has determined that your request, either in whole or in part, seeks copies of disclosable public records.  CSU will make available to you any that are public.\r\n\r\nRecords subject to the following exemptions will be withheld or redacted as appropriate:  Deliberative Process. Records that reflect the deliberative, decision-making process of the CSU, which often involves multiple individuals, who need to converse about issues candidly. Cal. Govt. Code \u00a77922.000; Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325; Montrose Chemical Corporation of California v. Train (D.DC 1982) 491 F.2d 63; Rogers v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal. App.4th 469.\r\n\r\nWe will let you know when we have gathered all the records.  It will be necessary to redact from them any personal and otherwise privileged information before they can be made available to you.  CSU estimates the records will be available January 24, 2026.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to inspect the records at CSULB, you may contact me to schedule a mutually convenient date and time.  If you wish to receive copies instead, CSU may charge the direct cost of duplication (20 cents per page).  Once the records are located, we will advise you as to the exact number of pages upon which any charge will be based.  We will require full payment before we begin the redaction and duplication process. The decision that records are exempt and will not be disclosed was made by the Records Access Officer at CSULB, Jamarr Johnson.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJamarr Johnson, CCSA\r\nDirector of Audit, Public Records & Special Projects\r\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach\r\n1250 Bellflower Blvd, BH 320\r\nLong Beach, CA 90840\r\n(562) 985-6033\r\n[csuLB-long]",

        "communication": "Dear Chis Amico -\r\n\r\nWe received your June 3, 2025, Public Records Act request for the following records: Booking contract for IBJJF World Championships.\r\n\r\nCSU has conducted a reasonable search for these records under California Government Code \u00a77922.535 and has determined that your request, either in whole or in part, seeks copies of disclosable public records.  CSU will make available to you any that are public.  Records subject to the following exemptions will be withheld or redacted as appropriate:\r\n\r\nRecords that reflect the deliberative, decision-making process of the CSU, which often involves multiple individuals, who need to converse about issues candidly. Cal. Govt. Code \u00a77922.000; Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325; Montrose Chemical Corporation of California v. Train (D.DC 1982) 491 F.2d 63; Rogers v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal. App.4th 469.\r\n\r\nWe will let you know when we have gathered all the records.  It will be necessary to redact from them any personal and otherwise privileged information before they can be made available to you.  CSU estimates the records will be available by July 25, 2025.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to inspect the records at CSULB, you may contact me to schedule a mutually convenient date and time.  If you wish to receive copies instead, CSU may charge the direct cost of duplication (20 cents per page).  Once the records are located, we will advise you as to the exact number of pages upon which any charge will be based.\u202f We will require full payment before we begin the redaction and duplication process.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJamarr Johnson, CCSA\r\nDirector of Audit, Public Records & Special Projects\r\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach\r\n1250 Bellflower Blvd, BH 320\r\nLong Beach, CA 90840\r\n(562) 985-6033\r\n[csuLB-long]",

All data on which ICE based the following language included in today's detainee death notification for Shiraz Fatehali Sachwani (https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/criminal-illegal-alien-pakistan-passes-away-suspected-natural-causes-fort-worth): \r\n\"ICE\u2019s in-custody deaths this past year average less than 1%--this is the lowest in ICE history.\"\r\n2. Any communications between ICE and DHS Press officers substantiating these two objective factual statements. \r\n\r\nI hereby request expedited processing pursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e) and make the following statements in support of this request under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information dissemination. See www.muckrack.com/Andrew-Free\r\n2. ICE's statement that the average of in-custody deaths the past year \"is the lowest in ICE history\" contains no identifiable, objective statistical basis in fact. \r\n3. There is an urgent need to inform the public if ICE is misleading policymakers and the world in press releases about deaths in ICE custody. \r\n4. ICE is under a legal obligation not to publish false or misleading information about objectively verifiable facts. \r\n5. Receiving the requested records will aid the public in either substantiating or falsifying the agency's claim about death in custody \"average\" being \"the lowest in ICE history.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Your request was received in this office on 12/11/2025. Specifically, you requested records pertaining to Shiraz Fatehali Sachwani. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).   You have not established that lack of expedited treatment in this case will pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual.  While you may be primarily engaged in the dissemination of information, you have not detailed with specificity why you feel there is an urgency to inform the public about Shiraz Fatehali Sachwani.  Qualifying urgency would need to exceed the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  You also did not offer sufficient supporting evidence of an interest of the public greater than the public\u2019s general interest in Shiraz Fatehali Sachwani.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nIf you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \r\n\r\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \r\nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \r\n500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \r\nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \r\n\r\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the FOIA office or Daniel Edgington, FOIA Public Liaison at 500 12th St. SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009 or (866) 633-1182. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned tracking number 2026-ICFO-08352.

The list is attached to this request.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation as well as the editor-in-chief and a contributor to a research magazine published by said foundation titled \"Cultural Engineering Studies.\" These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",
