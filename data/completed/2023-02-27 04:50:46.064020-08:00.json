        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Specifically, \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d   \r\n\r\nAs you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me at (605) 405-6229. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Stewart",

THIS has gotten her off of DWI's, burglary of the Sheriff's shed, harassing a tv reporter and other people, and most recently burglary of another habitation. The City of Robinson's legal representative, Lawyer Dixon, is used to protecting his other client, Sheriff McNamara from all things Sherre Johnston so it is no wonder that this request has gone on this long.  It is also why the Sheriff's department is the only Department in the State of Texas that does not have body cameras. NO body cams keep the Sheriff's people from recording Sherre screaming for Parnell. Unfortunately, Robinson, like everyone else, HAS body cams. These will prove as has been proven over and over again, that the woman has a get out of jail free cards because she's the Sheriff's girlfriend. Ask them.",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

        "communication": "This message is being sent on behalf of Doug Hale\r\n\r\nDear 137064-90576794@requests.muckrock.com,\r\n\r\nThe District is in receipt of your public records request dated 12/2/2022. Your request is for the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2020 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2020 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nYou have requested \u201cplease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format.\u201d The vast majority of records the District has disclosed in response to public records requests have not been produced in native format, and instead were produced in formats such as .pdf or hard-copy. You have requested \u201ca complete electronic copy of the District\u2019s Responses\u201d to public records requests during the time period in question (2020), and such responses typically did not contain native format records. Since your request is in conflict with the District's production of records, the District interprets your request as seeking the District\u2019s previous disclosure communications in their native format when they were sent electronically, recognizing that those disclosure communications will often contain non-native files. For example, the District would produce to you the native format email of its response to a given public records request, which may include attached responsive records in pdf format that were actually produced to a requestor. Please let me know if you disagree with this interpretation of your request.\r\nNext, please be aware that the District may no longer possess copies of older public records requests and/or District responses. In that event, the District would be unable to disclose copies of such requests and responses. The District retains records pursuant to the Core Retention Schedule of two years.\r\nPer RCW 42.56.120, the District charges the following fees for copies of records:\r\n1. Fifteen cents per page for photocopies of public records, printed copies of electronic public records when requested by the person requesting records, or for the use of agency equipment to photocopy public records;\r\n2. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n3. Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n4. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n5. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\nAny applicable copying costs must be received by the District before the District discloses records. Additionally, RCW 42.56.120 authorizes the District to require a deposit of up to ten percent of the total estimated costs of providing copies for a request. The District has not yet had an opportunity to determine how many responsive records there will be, or what the total estimated cost of fulfilling the request will be. Prior to providing a first installment of records for this request, we will contact you to let you know the total estimated cost and the deposit amount due. Following receipt of the deposit, the District will require payment of any applicable copying costs before producing installments.\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.120(4) we are charging a 10% deposit in order to produce about 1184 records. The deposit due is $1.48, the total amount due is $14.80. Please contact me at 425-408-7605 to coordinate a deposit. If I do not hear from you by January 10, 2023, the District will close your request consistent with RCW 42.56.120.\r\nIf you have any questions I can be reached at 425-408-7605.\r\n\u200b\nSincerely,\r\n\u200b\r\nDoug Hale\r\nExecutive Director of Human Resources\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a pleasant day.\r\n\r\nElaine Gisle\r\nExecutive Administrative Assistant\r\nHuman Resources  |  Northshore School District\r\nPhone: 425.408.7621<callto:425.408.7621>",

If the files were produced in paper form, please produce them to me in .pdf form.\r\n3. Retention schedule. All records should be available according to the retention schedule. This request is for records from 2020 and it is not yet 2023. Note: any records previously requested via the public records act that have yet to be produced by your district cannot be legally destroyed and ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THECORE RETENTION SCHEDULE. I suspect based on various outstanding records requests I see pending with your district, (and the fact that your district must retain all responses to public records requests for 2 years)  ONLY A LIMITED SUBSET OF PUBLIC RECORDS in your district can be destroyed based on the core retention schedule for the foreseeable future. Please consider this as affirmative notice.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n",

I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nAnon Koo \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fspokane-police-department-717%252Fpolice-records-request-138170%252F%253Femail%253Dspdrecordsinforequest%252540spokanepolice.org&url_auth_token=AAAkCQYMGrzer8VxLONpUgOmZfM%3A1p8Aoi%3AYyGJ4OmPyEuw1JpmeJCyM-R8ylDwIqcX8SyXJjkHptQ \r\nAs your request is written, we interpret it to mean you are seeking a staff roster for officers from the Spokane Police Department.\u00a0 However, is this request meant to include all City of Spokane employees?\u00a0 Please clarify this point at your earliest opportunity. \r\nWe anticipate an installment will be available in approximately 30 days, or on or about January 23, contingent upon receiving the above-requested clarification.\u00a0 We will follow up with you on or about that date regarding the status of your request.\u00a0 If public records become available in advance of this estimate, we will let you know.\u00a0 Conversely, if City staff encounters a need to extend our estimate, we will advise accordingly. \r\nSincerely, \r\nLaurie Farnsworth \r\nSpokane Deputy City Clerk",

DSHS, 193 Wn. App. 377 (2016) holds that when a city receives a request for documents that includes a list of individuals, the City is required to determine whether the list will be used for \u201ccommercial purposes.\u201d The case concluded that a requestor has a commercial purpose if the requestor intends to use the list for direct or indirect profit-making activity, regardless of whether the requestor intends to contact the individuals on the list or even if the individuals are personally affected by the release of the list or not. If the City has some indication that a requester intends to use a list of individuals for a commercial purpose, we are required to \u201cinvestigate further\u201d before we disclose that list. \r\nAlthough, as I stated above, you have provided some information as to your intended use of any provided records, we ask that you fill out and return the attached Commercial Purpose declaration, which includes additional questions we use to make an independent evaluation as to whether or not your purpose is commercial or not. \r\n\r\nTo avoid unnecessary delay in obtaining records for your request, please return the completed declaration at your earliest opportunity. We will follow up with you within five business days as to the validity of the stated purpose(s) relating to your request. Please return the completed declaration within 30 days of today's date, or by February 24, 2023.\u00a0 We anticipate the responsive records will be available approximately 14 days from the date of receipt of a completed declaration determined to be valid.\u00a0 If responsive records become available sooner than the estimated 14-day window, we will let you know. \r\nSincerely, \r\nLaurie Farnsworth \r\nSpokane Deputy City Clerk",

(The other five were Edwin Edwards, George Wallace, Jim Hunt, Bill Janklow, and Terry Branstad.) Rhodes is tied for the fourth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,840 days. As governor in 1970, Rhodes sent National Guard troops onto the Kent State University campus at the request of Kent, Ohio's mayor, after the ROTC building was burned down by unknown arsonists on May 2. On May 4, four students were killed and nine others were wounded by the Guard. One victim, Dean Kahler, suffered permanent paralysis. \r\n\r\nProof of death is not required, as the subject was born over 100 years ago.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

Also note that improperly addressed (i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the department number) requests might be returned as undeliverable.\u201d We would like to clarify with you whether the list you are requesting may be used for commercial purposes. RCW Chapter 42.56 governs the disclosure of public records in Washington State. The Public Disclosure Act is generally construed liberally to promote access to public records ( RCW 42.56.030). However, RCW 42.56.070(8) specifically prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals requested for commercial purposes\u201d. This section \u201cdoes not distinguish between different types of commercial purposes\u201d. \r\n\r\nPrior to providing you with the list you requested, please complete and return the attached Affidavit form. Once your signed Affidavit form is received, we will process your request. We will consider your request for this list as abandoned/closed unless we hear from you by February 21, 2023. \r\nPLEASE NOTE: Per RCW 42.56.120(4) , the KCSO reserves the right to close a records request after 30 days if a requester does not inspect, view, download, and/or pick up the records we provide. There is no obligation for us to continue producing records that are not being collected by a requester. \r\nRCW 42.56.120(4)\u00a0states that if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. \r\nWAC 44-14-04006(1)\u00a0states that a records request has been fulfilled and can be closed if an entirely unclear request has not been clarified, a request or installment has not been claimed or reviewed, or the requester cancels the request. Please reply to this message or log in to the Online Request System if you have any questions or would like to clarify or cancel this request.
