        "communication": "Hi Amy,\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your thoughtful response \u2014 I really appreciate your willingness to look into this and reach out to your colleagues in healthcare staffing.\r\n\r\nTo give you a bit of background: I\u2019m part of a grassroots meditation group that\u2019s offering free, trauma-informed mindfulness programs to support the mental health of incarcerated individuals. We\u2019ve been running these programs in community and retreat settings, and are now reaching out to state departments to see if there\u2019s interest in offering this kind of support within correctional facilities.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m hoping to connect with the licensed mental health professionals currently working in NCDAC facilities \u2014 psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, or counselors \u2014 to gauge whether this kind of offering might complement their existing work or wellness programming.\r\n\r\nFor the records request itself, I\u2019m looking for any of the following information you might have available:\r\n\t\u2022\tFull name\r\n\t\u2022\tJob title\r\n\t\u2022\tAssigned facility (if known)\r\n\t\u2022\tGovernment-issued work email (or phone if email isn\u2019t available)\r\n\r\nI completely understand if there isn\u2019t a single document containing all of this \u2014 even a partial list or direction to the right person or system would be incredibly helpful. I\u2019m also happy to refine the scope or format if that would make it easier to fulfill.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and consideration, and please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if any clarification would be useful.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nAndrew Ma",
