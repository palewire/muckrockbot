But now the area I live in is changing. Investors are coming in, buying the buildings they're renting to anybody they can rent to. The rents have gone up five, six, $700. Next door to me, there's a Ukraine, Ukraine owner. Well, first thing he wanted to do was make the building into a four flat. And I told him, You'll never do it while I'm living here.  And he says to me, he says, This is America. He says, this is freedom. He says, I can do anything I want. I told them if I was a younger man, I said I would beat the hell out of you because of freedom. Freedom says I can beat you up. And I says, I would have whipped your ass so fast. But he doesn't talk to me no more. ...\"\r\n\r\nAt which point the board president laughed heartily. \r\n\r\nVideo of this event can be found on the village's board meetings archive here:\r\n<https://play.champds.com/nilesil/event/236/s/4240>\r\n\r\nA complaint was lodged regarding the behavior of the board president with the Village of Niles Community Relations Commission at their August 2nd, 2023 meeting in public comment. \r\n\r\nAudio of this meeting can be found via this FOIA:\r\n<https://www.muckrock.com/foi/niles-8224/crc-meeeting-audio-8-2023-150153/#files>\r\n\r\nCommissioner Tony Dati made this statement regarding this complaint:\r\n\r\n\"So definitely can bring it up to him, I can bring it up to him, and talk to him about it. \r\n[Another speaker: By him are you referring to the mayor?]\r\nThe whole board, mayor and board.\r\n \u2026all right we\u2019ll definitely address all this and look into all this and try to have something prepared for our next meeting. \"\r\n\r\nIn the next meeting on October 11, 2023, this complaint was not addressed as promised. \r\n\r\nTo this effect, we are requesting all communications between Commissioner Tony Dati and any member of the Village of Niles board between the date of this meeting on August 2nd, 2023 and the following meeting on October 11, 2023. This should include emails, text, voicemails and forms of communication typical between village officials and Community Relations Commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNiles Coalition",
