The records request includes, but is not limited to, policies regarding: \r\n\r\nA. Fingerprint and other data sharing, \r\n\r\nB. ICE detainer requests,   \r\n\r\nC. Compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including guidance or policies around when communication with ICE officers is allowed, and \r\n\r\nD. Communicating with federal immigration enforcement officers. \r\n\r\nThis request covers any policies that are currently in effect or that have been in effect at any point on or after January 20, 2025. \r\n\r\n2. The five most recent communications (e.g., emails, text messages, call logs or transcripts, or otherwise) between a departmental officer or employee and a federal DHS or ICE employee concerning immigration matters. In addition, I request all records related to these communications, including, but not limited to, any records indicating that the department was made aware of the communications, discussions of their content or implications, evaluations them for compliance with departmental or other city policies, identification or acknowledgement of any potential policy violations, and any internal responses, disciplinary actions, or follow-up measures resulting from these communications. \r\n\r\n3. All records relating to incidents, if any, from January 20, 2025, to the day this request is responded to, in which an individual was taken from the department\u2019s custody directly into ICE custody. For each incident, the records request includes, but is not limited to, booking and transfer records, communications with ICE or other federal agencies, internal documentation or discussion of the transfer, and internal notes, memos, or documentation referencing communication with DHS or ICE.\r\n\r\nFor each request, I am not seeking identifying information, and I will accept anonymized or redacted data as necessary to protect identities. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. I expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

This office received your request on February 8, 2026.  Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, the Department processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although DHS\u2019 goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). As your request seeks documents that will require a thorough and wide-ranging search, DHS will invoke a 10-day extension for your request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). If you would like to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters. As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher. We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. This office will contact you before accruing any further fees. We have queried the appropriate component(s) of DHS for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the analysts in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. Your request has been assigned reference number 2026-HQFO-01778. Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence.  If you have any questions, or would like to discuss this matter, please feel free to contact this office at 1-866-431-0486 or 202-343-1743.\r\nRegards, \r\nGregory Bridges \r\nDirector, Disclosure \r\nDepartment of Homeland Security, Privacy Office",
