On June 1, 2024, their Facebook account invited the public to view the vehicle. Here is a news article on this event. \r\nhttps://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/prosper-police-departments-emergency-vehicle/3560134/\r\n\r\nI am requesting all recorded uses of this MRAP vehicle and any other vehicles that have been obtained through the Federal 1033 program. This included uses by both Prosper and Collin County's police/sheriff departments. It was mentioned in new reporting that the vehicle can help neighboring communities in Collin County. This request includes an use of the vehicle for community engagement, like the news article, and uses for emergency rescues. If this vehicle was used in other counties, please include their uses of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nI request that I be properly classified as a news media requester. I am an investigative researcher for Bellingcat, and I am requesting this information in that capacity and request that fees be waived for this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKolina Koltai",
