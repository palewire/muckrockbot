Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am appealing the denial of my FOIL request for \"All emails sent by ex-Chief Judge Janet DiFiore from July 1, 2022, to the date that her resignation as Chief Judge became effective.\"\r\n\r\nIn denying my FOIL request, OCA cited Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(3) and (COOG AO-18863 (April 5, 2012), COOG AO 18949 (Aug. 20, 2012)) to justify their determination that my request was overly broad and did not sufficiently describe the records requested.\r\n\r\nPublic Officers Law \u00a7 89(3) states that records must be \"reasonably described,\" which my request was, specifically requesting emails sent by one employee of OCA during a roughly one-month period.\r\n\r\nCOOG AO 18949 (accessible at https://docsopengovernment.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/2013/18949.html) states that \"agency staff are not required to engage in herculean or unreasonable efforts in locating records to accommodate a person seeking records.\" In that opinion, the request in question would have required combing through 3,000 emails to find the correspondence between two specific individuals over an unbounded time period.\r\n\r\nThat is not the case here. I am rather requesting the emails sent by one government employee over a one-month period.\r\n\r\nCOOG also noted that agencies have property denied \"requests for all email communications transmitted or received by a particular government officer or employee over a period of several years, without regard to subject matter or content.\" Again, the scope of this request is far narrower.\r\n\r\nOCA did not state that it would require unreasonable, or even particularly extensive, effort, to complete this request. In the opinion cited by OCA, COOG wrote: \"When an agency has the ability to locate and identify records sought in conjunction with its filing, indexing and retrieval mechanisms, it was found that a request meets the requirement of reasonably describing the records, irrespective of the volume of the request.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that OCA has the ability to locate and identify the emails sent by its former chief over a one-month period. Accordingly, my appeal should be granted.",

ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). \r\n5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy... \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. \r\nPlease also be advised that although the District does have an incident reporting database (Aspen) that is used to document incidents, it does not comprehensively track disciplinary/misconduct action against students. Although some student discipline is maintained in our incident reporting database,\u00a0 it does not comprehensively track the information you appear to be seeking. For example, an entry showing a school code of conduct violation might not always result in disciplinary action. Additionally, the date that an incident was entered may not be the same date as when the discipline was issued. Furthermore, multiple students may be involved in a single incident report in various roles such as a participant or a witness. In order to determine if an incident report resulted in disciplinary action the District would have to read through each of the hundreds of incident reports submitted, reconcile them with various student records, some of which are kept at the school-level, and generate a new record that is not done in the normal course of business. However, please use this link and scroll down to \u201cSuspension/Expulsion\u201d to view similar data available on the District\u2019s website: https://www.cps.edu/about/district-data/metrics/ Please note that the Illinois Freedom of Information Act applies to existing records only and public bodies are not required to compile data from multiple sources into a single record, or answer questions (See generally Hites v.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. If you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-338-1050 or by email at Erinstewart@cfjj.org. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Stewart\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

Your request was denied in part as a\u00a0portion of the responsive records were determined to be exempt from disclosure pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a0\u00a7 87(2)(g), as they are inter-agency or intra-agency materials which are not statistical or factual tabulations or data; instructions to staff that affect the public; final agency policy or determinations; or external audits.\u00a0 \u00a0Other records were determined to be exempt from disclosure pursuant to Public Officer\u2019s Law \u00a7 87(2)(e), as the records were compiled for law-enforcement purposes and disclosure would: i nterfere with law enforcement investigations or judicial proceedings; deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or impartial adjudication; identify a confidential source or disclose confidential information relating to a criminal investigation; and/or reveal criminal investigative techniques or procedures. Finally, the request for portions of records containing information that\u00a0could be a violation of personal privacy was denied. Because such information is exempt from disclosure under Public Officers Law \u00a7\u00a787(2)(b) and 89(2)(b), it has been redacted in the attached documents. Your request is granted for the portions of such records not containing exempt information. Please log in to the FOIL Records Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. If you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-338-1050 or by email at Erinstewart@cfjj.org. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Stewart\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

        "communication": "Dear Records Requestor:\r\n\r\nOur School District wishes to acknowledge receipt of your recent request for copies of public records, received on Friday, November 5, 2021.\r\n\r\nYour records request seems clear in one respect, as to the records you wish to have copied and provided to you by the initial segment of your request.  But, the second segment of your  request is not clear to us.  So, we are in need of clarification from you as to that segment.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is clear by the first segment of your request that you wish to receive a copy of every public records request that has been submitted to our School District, going back historically for more than a decade, to January 1, 2010.\r\n\r\nIt will be a daunting and time-consuming task to locate all of those records for duplication and production to you.  Some of those requests would have been received by us in electronic format only, e.g., such as via email.  Those would not have been forwarded to any central electronic file location, nor printed to a paper copy and placed in any particular physical file location.  As well, requests of that sort would not necessarily have been received by the person designated as our public records officer at the time the request was received.  Rather, any given request could conceivably been received by any other given employee in our District.\r\n\r\nFor additional reasons, designing a search methodology calculated to locate all such emailed requests would be very difficult, if not impossible.  That is because we cannot be required to read every single email received by every employee in our School District over the last ten-plus years, to locate for you those had content qualifying them as public records request.  That likely means the next alternative search methodology would be to employ electronic \"keyword\" searches, of our \"inbound\" email databases over the last ten years.  But those sorts of searches could well be unreliable, to in-fact yield all such requests, as it would be the case that some, if not many, records requestors did not cite our public disclosure law in making their requests, nor even use any particular words or phrasing - such as \"public record\" - when submitting their requests.  In fact, our state's public disclosure law provides that in order for a public agency like our District to be compelled to process a records request under that statute, the records requestor need not submit it to a particular employee of ours, but s/he need not provide a citation to that public disclosure law nor reference it by name or in any other manner, nor use any particular language in submitting the request.\r\n\r\nSo, to create a list of \"keyword\" search terms that would likely yield every single records request that our District has received, via email over the last ten-plus years, could indeed be a practical impossibility.  However, when faced with such a situation, our public disclosure laws suggest we dialogue with a requestor in your position, toward a cooperative collaboration aimed at generating a mutually agreed-upon list of keyword search terms that can be used to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nSo, toward that end, I'd like to initiate that dialogue.  Would you please give me a call or email me to dialogue on that point?\r\n\r\nAside from those difficulties with locating all electronic public records requests we've received over the last ten-plus years, we of course have received such requests in the form of physical (i.e., paper).  These largely would exist only in files contained in boxes in our School District's archives.  To search those files will take an immense amount of staff time.\r\n\r\nIn any case, because of the number and variety of locations of records requests in need of being located, copied, and produced to you in response to the first segment of your request, we plan to fulfill it in a series of partial-batch-installments.  We are now estimating that you should expect to receive the first installment within 60 days of this email, on or before January 14, 2022.\r\n\r\nAlso, before we provide you that first installment, we likely will need an advance pre-payment from you of the cost-of-production charges that are allowable under our state's public disclosure law.  I will advise you if that will be necessary, and of the required amount, within that same 60-day period.\r\n\r\nSecond, as I said above, we are uncertain of the scope of records you wish us to locate for you, by your language stating you wish to receive: \"a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses\" to each of the public records requests we'll be providing you.   By \"Responses,\" that could be fairly interpreted in many different ways, as to the scope of records you do or do not wish to receive.  For instance, it could mean you wish only to receive copies of the actual; records that School District gathered, copied, and provided to each given requestor, in \"Response\" to his or her request (i.e., because those records had content falling within the descriptive scope of the request).  On the other hand, we frequently \"Respond\" to requestors by directing letters or email communications to them that contain no actual \"Responsive\" records, but instead communicate with the requestor about any number of points of information or inquiry that arise in the course of processing records requests (in fact, this email is a precise example of that sort of \"Response\".)\r\n\r\nSo, we're in need of receiving clarification from you, by way of a reasonably specific description, as to the scope of records that you do wish to receive by that second segment of your request.\r\n\r\nPer the above, I will now look forward to engaging in the dialogue I've initiated with you, concerning collaboratively working together toward a mutually-agreeable list of \"keyword\" searches that we can utilize to locate the emailed public records requests you've requested, and also to receiving the clarification I requested above.\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

        "communication": "Dear Requestor:\r\n\r\nThank you for your inquiry about the initial response you received from me to your records request to our School District, and the one you received from the counterpart representative of mine at the Mead School District.  While we are extremely busy with other matters and our School District has no obligation to dedicate the time or effort necessary to answer your inquiry, we\u2019re more than happy to do so on this occasion.  That\u2019s because it is essential, for successful fulfillment of your request, to foster the sort of mutually collaborative dialogue with you that I offered and requested of you in the very same initial response email about which you are inquiring.  In fact, that sort of affirmative collaborative communication is exactly what the regulations under the Washington Public Records Act (\u201cPRA\u201d) call for, reciprocally from a requestor such as yourself and our District, when questions exist \u2013 as they do here, with your request \u2013 about just what particular records do and do not need to be located for production, and when \u2013 also as here \u2013 difficulties are presented by the request as to how to best go about searching to locate all responsive records that happen to exist in electronic form.\r\n\r\nSo, please accept the following explanation as to why you received like initial responses from our School District and the Mead School District and why the same may well be occurring by this email in response to the inquiry you\u2019ve now made \u2013 and why that, of course, was and is not at all a matter of coincidence.\r\n\r\nIt is not infrequent that our School District receives a PRA records request that, by its unique nature, volume, and/or ambiguity, prompts us to double-check on the steps we ought to take to make sure we entirely fulfill all of the obligations we owe the requestor under the PRA.  And in the course of that, it is not at all uncommon that we find it appropriate to consult for assistance/advice with PRA resources outside of our office, for additional expertise that might supplement our District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d PRA-processing experience and abilities.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to requests like yours, we and many other school districts believe that outside consultation is in fact a \u201cbest practice.\u201d  Doing so not only operates to the benefit of the school district that is in need of processing the request, but just as much to the benefit of the records requestor.  In short, that sort of outside-resource consultation enhances assurances that the requestor will indeed receive an appropriately-timely and -thorough production of a copy of every reasonably-locatable, non-exempt public record that s/he/it seeks, as the end-product of the district\u2019s execution of search and production steps that were, from the very outset, very concertedly designed to assure that the requestor indeed receives full performance of all obligations owed her/him/it under public disclosure requirements.\r\n\r\nAs I said, many other school districts in our state engage in that same best practice, by seeking supplemental PRA assistance from resources outside their own records-processing staff, to assure they properly process and fulfill a request like yours.  And sometimes, some of them by happenstance coincidentally consult with to the same, common outside resource for that assistance.\r\n\r\nSo, when two or more school districts have received the same, identical request, and they happen to have consulted with the same external PRA resource to help assure they give a proper initial response to the request, it is not a surprise if they happen to \u201cland on the same spot\u201d in communicating their initial responses to the same request/requestor.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what happened here.  Since the verbiage, substance, and detail of your requests to both our School District and the Mead District were and are precisely identical, we and that District were prompted by a need to address with you the exact same records-collection, technology, time frame, dialogue/clarification, etc., issues with you, via our respective initial responses; and by happenstance, we consulted with the same outside source for assistance with our respective initial responses, toward the aim of best fulfilling your request to your ultimate satisfaction.\r\n\r\nFor that same reason, as I stated above, it would not be surprising and indeed quite that you may well receive this same explanation, virtually identically, to the exact same inquiry you\u2019ve now directed to both of our districts.\r\n\r\nStill, having provided the foregoing, we  want to acknowledge and assure you that we in no way plan to provide you any sort of a \u201ccookie cutter\u201d approach to the continuing processing and fulfillment of your request.  That could not properly occur under the obligations we owe you under the PRA.  We fully understand that when a records request we\u2019ve received has also been identically submitted to another (or more than one other) school district, at some point \u2013 usually fairly early on \u2013 that request must and will be handled differently and uniquely by us, as compared to the different sort of handling that (or those) other district(s) must and will need to dedicate to their proper processing of that same request.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s so for virtually innumerable reasons.  Some of those, just by way of examples, would be that we are most certainly differently-situated as compared to the Mead District to the particular internal processes we have adopted for processing records requests, once we are assured we know the specific parameters of the scope of records implicated by the request; we doubtless have differing particularities in the protocols we have followed in our paper and electronic records-filing and -archiving systems, relative to how and where records responsive to the request in likely to be located in our District; comparatively greater or lesser staffing levels will exist, as between that District and ours, in terms of the volume and \u201cquality\u201d of human resources we and they have to dedicate to the processing of your request, particularly in terms of experience or expertise levels amongst records-processing staff members as to unique issues raised by the request; differences in availability of that staff to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other high-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our respective Districts\u2019 abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and protecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us; the numbers of employees outside of our records-processing staffs (e.g., administrators/teachers/others employed in our schools who will need to dedicate time to assisting in the records-gathering process for the request, and their ability to perform that work while still performing their duties; different levels of experience, technologies, and staff availability in our respective IT departments who likely will need to work on the request; etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons I\u2019ve stated, the appropriate \u201csameness\u201d of our School District\u2019s processing of your request, as between ourselves and the Mead District (or for that matter, as compared to any other school district that has received your request) likely will end very shortly \u2013 indeed we\u2019d expect, upon the occurrence of the requested, collaborative dialogue with you on the points that were identified in my initial response to you.  So I do look very much look forward to hearing from you so that we can address those points, and we can proceed with the benefit of that planned, good discussion in the best possible posture toward fulfilling your request in a timely and thorough manner that best meets your records and informational needs.\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360\u2013604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

        "communication": "Hello Ms. Cornelison,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response.\r\n\r\nI disagree with many of your statements in regards to the District\u2019s legal obligations for compliance with the Washington State Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nPlease note RCW 42.56.030:\r\n\r\n\u2018The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may maintain control over the instruments that they have created. This chapter shall be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed to promote this public policy and to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other act, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe following are responses to your request for \u201cclarification\u201d dated 11-16-2021:\r\n\r\n1. Please address any questions you may have regarding this public records request (PRR) in writing via email.\r\n\r\n2. You stated the District was \u201cuncertain\u201d as to the scope of records requested and you then requested a \u201creasonably specific description\u201d as to the scope of records requested.\r\n\r\nI begin my response below by incorporating the text of the original public records request dated 11-4-2021:\r\n\r\n\u201cI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Evergreen Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo further clarify this request: \r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all original PRA requests. If the original PRA request was made via email, I request the NATIVE electronic format to be produced. If the original request was made via US mail or limited to written paper form only, I request an electronic .pdf copy of the original request.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all communications between the District and the PRA requestor regarding the processing and any other aspect of production for the  PRR. All communications, requests for clarification and replies are responses by the District and were previously requested in my original request. If the communications between the District and the requestor were via email I request the NATIVE electronic email format to be produced. If the communications between the District and the original requestor were limited to written paper form I request a .pdf copy of any communications.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all \u201crecords and writings\u201d as defined by RCW 42.56 previously produced by the District in response to the original PRA request. If the District produced electronic files in response to a PRA request, I request a duplicate copy of the files produced. If the District produced paper copies in response to a PRA request, I request a .pdf copy of those paper copies to be produced. \r\n\r\n3. As for keyword searches and the District\u2019s expressed difficulty in locating electronic and paper public records requests over the years, unfortunately I cannot offer guidance other than to suggest the District immediately seek and retain additional expertise that might supplement District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d PRA-processing experience and abilities. This PRR is not for keywords but rather for public records previously produced by the District.\r\n\r\nPlease reference WAC 44-14-04003 (10) Searching for records.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn agency must conduct an objectively reasonable search for responsive records. The adequacy of a search is judged by the standard of reasonableness. A requestor is not required to \"ferret out\" records on his or her own. A reasonable agency search usually begins with the public records officer for the agency or a records coordinator for a department of the agency deciding where the records are likely to be and who is likely to know where they are. One of the most important parts of an adequate search is to decide how wide the search will be. If the agency is small, it might be appropriate to initially ask all agency employees and officials if they have responsive records. If the agency is larger, the agency may choose to initially ask only the staff of the department or departments of an agency most likely to have the records. For example, a request for records showing or discussing payments on a public works project might initially be directed to all staff in the finance and public works departments if those departments are deemed most likely to have the responsive documents, even though other departments may have copies or alternative versions of the same documents. Meanwhile, other departments that may have documents should be instructed to preserve their records in case they are later deemed to be necessary to respond to the request. The agency could notify the requestor which departments are being surveyed for the documents so the requestor may suggest other departments.\r\n\r\nIf agency employees or officials are using home computers, personal devices, or personal accounts to conduct agency business, those devices and accounts also need to be searched by the employees or officials who are using them when those devices and accounts may have responsive records. If an agency's contractors performing agency work have responsive public records of an agency as a consequence of the agency's contract, they should also be notified of the records request. It is better to be over inclusive rather than under inclusive when deciding which staff or others should be contacted, but not everyone in an agency needs to be asked if there is no reason to believe he or she has responsive records. An email to staff or agency officials selected as most likely to have responsive records is usually sufficient. Such an email also allows an agency to document whom it asked for records. Documentation of searches is recommended. The courts can consider the reasonableness of an agency's search when considering assessing penalties for an agency's failure to produce records.\u201d\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm writing to let you know that we have an initial installment of records available for you. As requested, public records requests received by our District are being provided in the native format in which they were received. Also as requested, responses between our District and the requestor generated in the course of processing and fulfilling the request, are being provided in their native format. No new or additional redactions have been made to this installment of records, and a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Please note, requests for educational records containing information directly related to specific students under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), that were inadvertently made using the District's public records request email, have been designated as not responsive to your request. Of course please let me know if this is not an accurate understanding of the records you wish to receive.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this initial installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, this installment of records is being provided electronically via a [?Folder icon]  shared file<https://evergreenps-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/eliza_cornelison_evergreenps_org/EqkR4RJDy4hCj-5XFaq3o68B9lVHj2f4lSgm4rosC-Rgyw> that, as requested, is a public link and is not password protected. If you have any trouble accessing, downloading, or saving the records via that link, of course let me know so that we can troubleshoot the issue or get you the records in an alternate way.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our District is authorized by Board Policy 4040<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BM8UJL7C1628/$file/4040%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Revised)%202.28.2020.pdf> and Procedure 4040P<https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/esd114/Board.nsf/files/BXFR9L6C2E74/$file/4040P%20Procedure%20-%20Public%20Access%20to%20District%20Records%20(Adopted%202.28.2020).pdf> to request payment for electronic records as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n2. Five cents per every four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloudbased data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nI want to let you know that because the records we're providing you today comprise a comparatively small number of records (93 electronic records), we're able to waive the correspondingly de minimis PRA fees that otherwise would have been chargeable to you, as a pre-payment condition for your receipt of this installment. (That amount would have been $1.15, based on the statutorily-authorized formula of $.05/per every four electronic records; 93 / 4 = 23.25; 23 x $0.05 = $1.15).\r\n\r\nThe possible charge for the remaining records, however, likely will not be so de minimis that we could waive charges.  So, please be prepared that we likely will be asking that you pre-pay before we'll be able to provide you future installments.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing. Otherwise, in transmitting a partial installment production of this sort, we are also required by public disclosure law to provide you the date by which we estimate we'll be able to provide you our next installment of responsive records.  In that regard, we're estimating you should not expect to receive our next installment toward fulfillment of your request for 30 business days, measured from today's date, on or before March 1, 2022. As explained in my previous email, the time needed to process each installment is due to the differences in availability of staff needed to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other high-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our respective Districts' abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and protecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing or about any other aspect of our processing of your request as we proceed to work towards fulfilling it, of course do not hesitate to let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

As requested, public records requests received by our District are being provided in the native format in which they were received. Also as requested, responses between our District and the requestor generated in the course of processing and fulfilling the request, are being provided in their native format. No new or additional redactions have been made to this installment of records, and a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this initial installment is too large to be sent via email.

Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to scan the records;\r\n2. Five cents per every four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloudbased data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n3. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records electronically; and\r\n4. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the District, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\nI want to let you know that because the records we're providing you today comprise a comparatively small number of records (56 electronic records), we're able to waive the correspondingly de minimis PRA fees that otherwise would have been chargeable to you, as a pre-payment condition for your receipt of this installment.\r\n\r\nThe possible charge for the remaining records, however, likely will not be so de minimis that we could waive charges.  So, please be prepared that we likely will be asking that you pre-pay before we'll be able to provide you future installments.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing. Otherwise, in transmitting a partial installment production of this sort, we are also required by public disclosure law to provide you the date by which we estimate we'll be able to provide you our next installment of responsive records.  In that regard, we're estimating you should not expect to receive our next installment toward fulfillment of your request for 35 business days, measured from today's date, on or before April 15, 2022. As explained in my previous email, the time needed to process each installment is due to the differences in availability of staff needed to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other high-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our respective Districts' abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and protecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing or about any other aspect of our processing of your request as we proceed to work towards fulfilling it, of course do not hesitate to let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nI'm writing to let you know that we have another installment of records available for you. As you know, we provided previous installments at no cost due to the District's waiver or the de minimis Public Records Act (PRA) fee associated with those installments. However, as was previously explained to you, further installments would likely exceed an amount that we could consider de minimis and waive the charges. The next installment consists of 3,694 hard-copy pages. Under the PRA, pre-payment of $.10/page, or $369.40, is required to scan those records for processing and production of electronic copies to you. This amount does exceed the de minimis threshold.\r\n\r\nYou can make that $369.40 payment by mailing a check, money order, or similar form of payment made payable to \"Evergreen Public Schools,\" addressed to me as follows:\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\nAttn: Public Records Fees\r\nP.O. Box 8910\r\nVancouver, WA 98668\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may make that payment in person at our District Office, located at 13413 NE LeRoy Haagen Memorial Drive, Vancouver, WA 98684 on any non-holiday weekday. However, I suggest calling ahead to make sure the office is open to receive your payment. The best number to call is (360) 604-4049.\r\n\r\nOnce we receive payment, we will then be authorized by the PRA to scan the copies for you. The scanning process will not take long. However, those scanned copies will need to be reviewed for exempt material under the PRA and redaction of the same. This review will likely take considerable time, given the number of records. We estimate this review-redaction work will take approximately sixty days to complete once we receive the pre-payment required as outlined above.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that we are required to allow you a thirty-day time frame to make the pre-payment as outlined above, measured from the date of this email. A failure to receive such payment from a requester within that time frame permits us to consider their request abandoned and close it.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing or any other aspect of the processing of your request as we work towards fulfilling it, please do not hesitate to let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEliza Cornelison\r\nParalegal | Human Resources\r\nEvergreen Public Schools\r\n360-604-4049 | eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org<mailto:eliza.cornelison@evergreenps.org>\n",

Also as requested, responses between our District and the requestor generated in the course of processing and fulfilling the request, are being provided in their native format. Please note, the emails in this installment were not uploading correctly. Those emails have been converted to pdfs, and the metadata has been provided via an Excel spreadsheet titled \"Muckrock Metadata - Eleventh Installment\", included in the folder linked below.\r\n\r\nWe noted that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments, however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email. Therefore, this installment of records is being provided electronically via a shared file<https://evergreenps-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/eliza_cornelison_evergreenps_org/EqkR4RJDy4hCj-5XFaq3o68B9lVHj2f4lSgm4rosC-Rgyw> that, as requested, is a public link and is not password protected. If you have any trouble accessing, downloading, or saving the records via that link, of course let me know so that we can troubleshoot the issue or get you the records in an alternate way.\r\n\r\nA detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable, and I do need to briefly provide you information as to all additional records that I redacted in the course of fulfilling your request.\r\n\r\nAdditional redactions were made to some of the records included in the\"2.2020\", \"6.11.2021\", \"6.17.2021\" and \"9.2021\" folders of this installment. In that regard, at RCW 42.56.250(6) that statutory exemption-to-public disclosure protects against revealing the identities of complainants, other accusers, or witnesses as to alleged events of the sort that were investigated in the above folders, and who were identified as such in the materials compiled in the investigations. So, to the extent the identities of such persons could be determined by a reader of the originals of the attached records, then that personally-identifying content, as to those persons, was obscured from your ability to read it in the attached copies of those originals. Those redactions were made by our imposition of bright blue electronic redaction boxes (i.e., ___________), with all or part of the following phrase overwritten on each such box in black typeface: \"RCW 42.56.250(6)\".\r\n\r\nRedactions made under the exemption of that statute are, however, conditional, by the statute's terms. In that regard, each such accuser/complaint and witness has a right to elect that instead, the content that identifies him or her be revealed to you, as it exists in the originals of these records.  So, we have advised each such person of his/her right to make that election. As of fourteen days from today's date,  if and to the extent any of those persons advises me that s/he does consent to having his/her name/initials, as they appear in the records, disclosed to you, we will then re-produce these same records to you, but with reversal of the de-identifying redactions we've made for those persons, such that you would then be able to read their identities. So even though we've now provided you a copy of every record responsive to your request, we cannot formally consider your request closed for another two weeks. If we need to make the sort of supplemental re-production to you that I've described, then you will receive it at that time.\n",
