Any correspondence, reports, or memoranda exchanged between JPMorgan and relevant government agencies during the historical period when the institution may have been involved in the slave trade.\r\n\r\n2. Documents related to any investigations, audits, or regulatory actions taken against JPMorgan regarding its historical practices in connection with the slave trade.\r\n\r\n3. Any internal policies, guidelines, or communications within the National Archives and Records Administration that pertain to the preservation, classification, or accessibility of documents concerning financial institutions and their historical involvement in morally reprehensible practices such as the slave trade.\r\n\r\n4. Records indicating any efforts or initiatives undertaken by the National Archives and Records Administration to proactively disclose information related to the historical involvement of financial institutions, including JPMorgan, in the slave trade.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I would like to draw your attention to relevant case law, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n- **National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004):** This case emphasizes the importance of balancing the privacy interests against the public interest in disclosure when considering FOIA requests.\r\n\r\n- **Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989):** This case underscores the need for a functional analysis of the requested documents, focusing on the nature and content of the information rather than the identity of the parties involved.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a detailed justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease be aware of your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request will be instantly published on the platform.",

I am requesting access to the following records in the possession of the National Archives and Record Administration (NARA):\r\n\r\nAll records related to Project Fantasia. Project Fantasia was a collaboration between the Office of Strategic Services (record group 226) and the Office of Scientific Research and Development (record group 227), and was assigned a project number of SAC-26. A 2016 article published by NARA in Prologue Magazine, titled \"Secret Weapons, Forgotten Sacrifices,\" contains a description of Project Fantasia and identifies some of the records as being in record group 227. It can be found here: https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2016/spring/office-scientific-research-development-world-war-ii\r\n\r\nPlease restrict your search for any records to record groups 226 and 227.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to review these records in-person, at your location in College Park, Maryland. If any of these records are being held at a facility other than the one in College Park, please notify me of this before processing the request.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please advise which tier of processing queue this request falls under and an estimated time frame for processing.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said destruction or transfer, to include but not be limited to confirmation that NARA has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
