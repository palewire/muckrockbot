If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I\r\n    have previously written about the government and its activities, with\r\n    some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo,\r\n    MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn\r\n    Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of\r\n    publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established.\r\n    In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them\r\n    available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and\r\n    and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large\r\n    audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of\r\n    it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate\r\n    the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n    Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to\r\n    disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the\r\n    public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice,\r\n    19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that\r\n    \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number\r\n    of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as\r\n    a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on\r\n    the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires\r\n    that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id.\r\n    \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there\r\n    is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As\r\n    such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of\r\n    determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by\r\n    reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees\r\n    be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records relating to or mentioning a group which the FBI referred to as a\r\n    \"black street gang known as the \"FOLKS\".\"\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

State and local agencies that spent less than $100,000 may voluntarily submit reports (RCW 40.14.026(5)).\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2021.

The most recent public records should be produced first. \r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\nPlease provide all electronic records in their native electronic format. Please do not create new records by printing native electronic files then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints for electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Daniel Bledsoe. As you probably recall, the FBI located approximately 1330 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFOIA Negotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nNeed a status check?

Big Local News is a program of Stanford University\u2019s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and helps journalists collect, process and analyze public data. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking any datasets, databases, and/or spreadsheets sufficient to show the following information regarding every current or former sworn employee of the Hawaii Department of Public Safety, year-by-year, dating back however far as the data exist for:\r\n\r\nFirst name\r\nMiddle name or initial\r\nLast name\r\nUnique employee identification number\r\nStar or badge number\r\nRace\r\nGender\r\nYear of birth\r\nRank\r\nTroop assignment\r\nUnit assignment\r\nDivision assignment (Patrol, Investigations, Support, etc.)\r\nHire date\r\nSeparation date, if applicable\r\nReason for separation, if applicable\r\n\r\nIf your certification/roster system contains data elements not listed above, please include them in the response, provided they are releasable under the law. On the other hand, we recognize some of the information we are asking for may not be tracked by your system. If that is the case, we are willing to accept as many of the data elements as your agency maintains. If some records are more readily available, we are happy to receive partial information as soon as possible while the remaining request is processed. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the data elements listed, we request documentation necessary to understand and interpret the data, including but not limited to record layouts, data dictionaries, code sheets, lookup tables, etc. \r\n\r\nOur preference is to receive structured data provided in a machine-readable text file, such as delimited or fixed-width formats. We can also handle a variety of other data formats including SQL databases, Excel workbooks and MS Access. If there are additional formats your agency would prefer to provide, please let us know. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking this information as a news media organization on a matter of public interest concerning the conduct of government. As such, we ask for a waiver of all fees, if allowed under state law. If fees are necessary to reimburse the agency for actual costs, we agree to pay up to $100. If costs exceed that amount, please let us know before fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease send clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time. Thank you very much for your time and attention to this request.\r\n\r\nSam Stecklow\r\nJournalist\r\nInvisible Institute",

Detainee deaths have been the subject of widespread media attention culminating in congressional action, including the mandatory reporting requirements ICE itself describes. https://www.ice.gov/detain/detainee-death-reporting. ICE is currently violating that law by allotting itself 90 days instead of 30. The purpose of the Death Report publication requirement is to ensure Congress and the public have information about deaths in custody. Access to timely, complete, and accurate information allows the public to take protective actions and advocate policies that could reduce these deaths. For instance, public outcry over in-custody deaths resulted in Congress ordering the DHS Office of Inspector General to conduct an annual review of ICE and CBP in-custody deaths to determine if any systemic issues contributed to those tragedies and make recommendations about how to address those issues. See https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-02/OIG-23-12-Feb23.pdf. \r\n\r\nAs of the date of this request - May 11, 2023 - ICE is in violation of the 30-day Death Report publication requirement. This means the ICE detention system is violating the Anti-Deficiency Act, and ICE leaders are potentially subject to civil and criminal penalties. \r\n\r\nPlease grant this request expedited processing and bring ICE into compliance by posting the detainee death report for Mr. Vargas on ICE\u2019s FOIA reading room, or supplying it to the #DetentionKills Transparency Initiative so that we may post it publicly. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

        "communication": "05/16/2023Andrew FreeMuckRock News, DEPT MR145704Boston, Massachusetts 02115 RE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2023-ICFO-25793        Dear Requester:This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 5/11/2023, and to your request for expedited treatment. Your request was received in this office on 5/11/2023. Specifically, you requested ICE Detainee Death Report regarding Salvador Vargas, 61, who ICE says died April 7, 2023, after being imprisoned at CoreCivic\u2019s Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, which has housed 10 people for ICE who have died in the past 6 years. https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/noncitizen-ice-custody-passes-away-georgia-hospital.Your request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. Under the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). Your request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards.   Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10- day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you care to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free, as are the first two hours of search time, after which you will pay the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.If you deem the decision to deny expedited treatment of your request an adverse determination, you have the right to appeal.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to:                                 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement                                 Office of the Principal Legal Advisor                                 U.S. Department of Homeland Security                                 500 12th Street,, S.W., Mail Stop 5900                                  Washington, D.C. 20536-5900Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.ICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records.

Albert Fentress is a convicted criminal who gained notoriety for his involvement in the abduction, rape, and murder of a college student in Poughkeepsie in the late 1980s. Fentress was arrested, tried, and convicted for these heinous crimes, and his case has been a subject of public interest and scrutiny for several years.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there have been further allegations against Albert Fentress, including suspicions of involvement in other unsolved cases of a similar nature. These allegations have raised concerns within the community and have sparked discussions about the extent of Fentress's criminal activities. Therefore, I believe it is crucial to access the requested records to shed light on these allegations and provide a comprehensive understanding of the investigations conducted by the City of Poughkeepsie Police Department.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nArrest records and charging documents related to Albert Fentress.\r\nCourt records, including judgments, verdicts, and sentencing information.\r\nPolice reports, incident reports, and any other investigative documents related to Albert Fentress.\r\nCorrespondence and communications, including emails, letters, memoranda, or any other written exchanges mentioning or involving Albert Fentress.\r\nAny audio or visual recordings, such as interviews, interrogations, or surveillance footage related to Albert Fentress.\r\nAny internal memos, policies, or guidelines concerning the handling of Albert Fentress's case.\r\nGiven the profound impact of Albert Fentress's crimes on the community and the ongoing interest in understanding the scope of his criminal activities, accessing these records will contribute significantly to the public's understanding of the operations and activities of the City of Poughkeepsie Police Department.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I firmly believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure will greatly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\nPhone:845 218 0299\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com. Additionally, any correspondence in relation to this request will be instantly published on the platform.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.",

If payment is needed to cover actual costs incurred by the City in processing your request, you will be advised and required to remit payment prior to the City releasing the records to you.\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[Image result for wildwood mo logo]\r\nMegan Eldridge, MRCC\r\nCity Clerk\r\nCity of Wildwood\r\n16860 Main Street<https://goo.gl/maps/nUqBDAkjnNE2>\r\nWildwood, MO 63040-1242<https://goo.gl/maps/nUqBDAkjnNE2>\r\n636-405-2029",

See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.If you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.
