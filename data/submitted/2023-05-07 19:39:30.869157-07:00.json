The Public Records we are requesting include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Quarterly Progress Reports (QPRs) submitted by the County to the DOJ summarizing the Tobacco Grant-funded activities; and\r\nThe fully signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the DOJ and the County pertaining to the Tobacco Grant; and\r\nThe fully signed MOU or other such agreement between the County and each and every school, whether public, private or parochial, that lies within the unincorporated patrol jurisdictions of Marin County that the MCSO serves;\r\nAny Public Records intended for use or in fact used to communicate the duties and responsibilities to an SRO or candidate for an SRO; \r\nAny Public Records intended for use or in fact used to communicate the schedule of the SRO position funded by the Tobacco Grant; \r\nAny Public Records intended for use or in fact used to communicate the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the SRO position; and\r\nAny Public Records submitted by the SRO funded by the Tobacco Grant to the County citing each activity performed by the SRO; \r\nAny Public Records documenting the allocation of TUPE funding to each School District within the County including the work plan; and\r\nAny and all quantitative and qualitative analysis conducted using the TUPE Evaluation Surveys submitted to the County by each School District and the Marin County Office of Education, including the Student Curriculum and Presentation Feedback, Brief Intervention Post-Survey, Parent/Caregiver and Community Member Presentation Feedback, Staff Presentation/Professional Development, and Peer Educator/Leadership Feedback surveys.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this request is to gather all Public Records pertaining to the County\u2019s application of the Tobacco Grant and the SRO position to be funded by the Tobacco Grant including the specific activities outlined in the job description.\r\nNone of the undersigned is a member, agent, officer, or employee of a federal, state, or local agency acting within the scope of his or her membership, agency, office, or employment.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public. This request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nIn the event the County shall choose to withhold any such documents, pursuant to Govt Code \u00a7 6255, the County shall justify withholding any record by demonstrating that the record in question is exempt under express provisions of the Act or that on the facts of this particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record. Pursuant to Govt Code \u00a7 6253, if the County feels a portion of a record should be withheld because it feels that portion is exempt, then any reasonably segregable portion of the record shall be made available after deletion of the portions that are exempted by law. \r\nIn the event that there are fees, we would be grateful if you would inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling this request. We would prefer that the request be fulfilled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
