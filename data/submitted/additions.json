This may include complaints related to securities fraud, insider trading, or any other area over which the SEC has jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nI would like to request information on any companies owned or controlled by Donald J Trump, including but not limited to the Trump Organization, Trump Foundation, and Trump International Hotels. Please include any and all relevant communications, documents, or other materials related to complaints filed against these entities or their representatives.\r\n\r\nTo support my request, I would like to cite several relevant court cases, including SEC v. Trump, 279 F. Supp. 2d 340 (S.D.N.Y. 2003), SEC v. Trump, 2020 WL 4044162 (S.D.N.Y. July 17, 2020), and SEC v. Trump, 2021 WL 1520177 (S.D.N.Y. April 19, 2021). These cases demonstrate the importance of transparency and accountability in the securities industry, and underscore the need for disclosure of relevant complaints and information.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to provide notice that any withholding or deletion of responsive records without a lawful basis will result in my pursuit of legal action and complaint to the appropriate authorities. As you are aware, FOIA requires agencies to disclose all non-exempt records in response to a request within a reasonable time frame, and any failure to do so would constitute a violation of the law.\r\n\r\nPlease provide any responsive records to this request on a rolling basis, as they become available.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGood Citizen",
