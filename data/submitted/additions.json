I am requesting the \"complaint request\" in the category of \"Air Pollution, Odor or Dust,\" which is the raw intake of \"Air Pollution, Odor or Dust Complaint Requests.\" Last August, I received  this data for the year of 2022 (https://www.muckrock.com/foi/chicago-169/air-pollution-odor-or-dust-complaint-request-132006/). I'm requesting the same data, in the same form, but for the years 2010 to 2022. \r\n\r\nThus, I request the raw data - in a machine-readable database or spreadsheet format such as Excel, CSV, Access, SQL or XML - pertaining to \"Air Pollution, Odor or Dust Complaint Requests.\" The data should include all fields in the database or spreadsheets that contain non-exempt information. I also request all documentation that describes the layout of the database\u2019s tables and fields, and that provides the definitions of any field names, codes, and abbreviations used in the database. This information may be gathered together in a single document like a data dictionary, entity layout, or user's guide. If that is the case, I request access to and copy of said document.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDillon Bergin",
