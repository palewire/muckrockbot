        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. The ICE Detainee Death Report for Pete Sumalo Montejo, who passed away December 5, 2025, in ICE custody in Texas. \r\n2. A copy of the ICE ERO or IHSC Significant Incident Report or Significant Event Notification\r\n\r\nAccording to the information currently published on ICE's website, ICE was under a Congressional mandate to release this information no later than 30 days after his death, and to update it no more than 60 days after each immigrant's death. ICE has released a Death Report for Jean Wilson Brutus and Shiraz Sachwani, both of whom died after Mr. Sumalo Montejo. \r\n\r\nI make this request under both 5 USC 552(a)(2) - which governs the agency's affirmative disclosure obligations - and 552(a)(3), which concerns the agency's obligation to respond to a request. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(ii) and (iv), I seek expedited processing of this request, and certify and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and current understanding: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media, primarily engaged information dissemination. See www.MuckRack.com/Andrew-Free.\r\n\r\n2. I research and publish regarding deaths in ICE custody. My work documenting deaths in ICE detention is published, cited, and relied upon by national media outlets, including the Washington Post, the New York Times, the L.A. Times, and others. \r\n\r\n3. As of the date of filing my filing of this request, ICE has not posted its Detainee Death Report for this individual. \r\n\r\n4. There is an urgent need to inform the public about the circumstances ICE is aware of surrounding this death. Congress is currently contemplating alterations to DHS and ICE's funding, and the facts of each death in custody directly impact demands lawmakers and the public may wish to press when authorizing future funding increases, or applying limits to them.\r\n\r\n5. Deaths in ICE custody reached their highest numbers in 20 years in 2025, and they have been the subject of widespread media coverage, and there is significant reason to believe ICE's treatment of people in detention has not met the standards it claims it adheres to when defending its actions in public statements. This coverage has prompted a number of responses by DHS's Twitter page and other public statements, pushing back against the coverage.\r\n\r\n6. I will make the records available to the general public upon receiving them.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Internal Control Deficiencies: Any written communications from external auditors regarding \"significant deficiencies\" or \"material weaknesses\" in the City\u2019s internal controls related to departmental compliance with the City Charter, specifically regarding the qualification of officers under Charter Section 2-5.\r\n\r\n3. Compliance Testing Records: Any audit \"working papers\" or summaries in the City's possession that document the testing of Oaths of Office for the Health Department Directors (Fernanda Carvalho, Kara Prunty, and Lisa Morrissey).\r\n\r\n4. Single Audit Compliance: For the years 2018\u20132024, please provide the \"Report on Compliance for Each Major State/Federal Program\" that specifically addresses the Health Department\u2019s adherence to administrative legal requirements.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest & Urgency: These records are of vital public interest following the $17 million verdict in Girolametti v. Danbury, which established a pattern of \"reckless disregard\" within City departments. The failure of three consecutive Health Directors to file mandatory Oaths of Office suggests a systemic failure of internal controls that the auditors were tasked to identify.\r\n\r\nI request a response within the statutory four business days. If any portion of this request is denied, please cite the specific exemption and provide the name of the official responsible for the denial.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
