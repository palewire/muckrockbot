Specifically, I seek:\r\n\r\n1) All non-exempt investigative records, including but not limited to incident reports, follow-up reports, witness statements, and case summaries, held at 1 Police Plaza.\r\n2) A copy Leanne Hausberg's diary, which is located at One Police Plaza, as confirmed to me by former NYPD detective John Ferriso.\r\n3) General NYPD policies, procedures, or training manuals for handling missing persons cases in 1999, particularly for minors and Indigenous persons, to understand investigative protocols.\r\n4)Any inter-agency communications (e.g., with the FBI or Kings County DA) related to Case #09-7493 CF, redacted as needed to protect privacy.\r\n\r\nI understand that certain records may be exempt under POL \u00a7 87(2), such as those interfering with an ongoing investigation (POL \u00a7 87(2)(e)(i)), personal privacy (POL \u00a7 87(2)(b)), or medical/DNA information (POL \u00a7 87(2)(a)). However, given that this case is over 26 years old with no publicly reported developments since 1999, it likely has no active leads, and thus disclosure would not interfere with an ongoing investigation, as exemptions cease when investigations conclude (Lesher v. Hynes, 19 NY3d 57, 2012). I request that any exempt portions be redacted and that all segregable, non-exempt records be released, as required by Gould v. NYC Police Dep\u2019t (89 N.Y.2d 267). \r\n\r\nIf no additional records exist beyond the initial complaint report provided to me on July 9, 2025, please confirm this in writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is made in the public interest to understand NYPD\u2019s handling of missing minors\u2019 cases, as highlighted by media coverage (e.g., ABC7\u2019s \u201cMissing\u201d series) and also to understand the NYPD's handling of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous People crisis, as Leanne Hausberg (Birth Name: Leanne Marie Billie) was half-Native American.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me at sarahaziz822@gmail.com or (929) 752-2814 for correspondence. \r\n\r\nThank you very much for your attention to this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

My request includes but is not limited to 137, 157, 176, 177, 183, 184, 188, and 214 files.

Please search for any\r\ncorrespondence to or from DOIG by either Director William Webster or William\r\nSessions. According to a blog post read, it is important that I state the\r\nfollowing: \"As you know, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is required to\r\nsearch the records stored at NARA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD,\r\nbut still technically under the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control. For more information see 36 CFR\r\n1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington\r\nRecords Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to DALE DOIG.\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited\r\nto all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio\r\nfiles, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found\r\nin other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-\r\nrelated names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other\r\nidentifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult\r\nthe Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR)\r\nData Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records,\r\nPhysical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records,\r\nand all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition\r\nto any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to\r\nDALE DOIG. If the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or\r\ncertain portions must be redacted please provide any reasonable segregable\r\nportion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions\r\nclaimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the\r\nrecord, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record\r\nwhich is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate\r\non the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed. Thank you\r\nfor the bureau's commitment to transparency.
