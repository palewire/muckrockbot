Colonel Kristina Stanger, and Colonel Zach Nunn. These actions appear to constitute whistleblower retaliation and are connected to Regent Bruce Rastetter. This request also relates to my 2017 Iowa False Claims Act petition, which remains under seal, and my public letter to Polk County Attorney John Sarcone seeking civilian oversight of suspected misconduct. This misconduct includes the alleged misuse of MQ-9 Reaper drones for unreported \"pay-to-slay\" and \"drink-and-drone\" activities, which may not have been properly reported to the Polk County Medical Examiner.\r\n\r\nOctober 2023 PPE Donation:\r\nRecords regarding Governor Kim Reynolds' purported donation of a warehouse of personal protective equipment (PPE) to \"Israel\" in October 2023. I am requesting clarification on whether the PPE was defective and subsequently disposed of in an Illinois landfill, or if it was actually shipped to Israel.\r\n\r\nDisclosures by Intelligence Officer Zach Nunn:\r\nRecords related to intelligence officer Zach Nunn's disclosures to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and Iowa DOD, particularly regarding potential inconsistencies in his 2018 testimony to the Iowa House. Specifically, I request documentation of whether Nunn failed to disclose his wife Kelly Nunn\u2019s Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) income from China and Saudi Arabia via Brenna Bird\u2019s LS2Group.\r\n\r\nThese records are necessary to investigate potential misuse of public resources, transparency concerns, and compliance with ethical and legal standards by Iowa National Guard personnel and related entities.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This includes records from 2005, such as the $35,000 embezzled from the Iowa State University Foundation to Blouin for Governor via Belin McCormick attorneys Zumbach and Boykin.\r\nRelevant law firms include, but are not limited to, Daigle Law (admitted in April 2024 in the ISU Daily), Dentons Davis Brown (ISU Daily), Belin McCormick (ISU Foundation, ISU Research Park), Husch Blackwell (2018 ISU Daily admission), Nyemaster (Krapf v. Rastetter). Additional information may exist under seal and should be included as appropriate.\r\n\r\nFARA and LS2Group Incorporation by Belin McCormick\r\nRecords relating to the incorporation of LS2Group, a FARA-registered entity connected to Governor Counsel Bird. Specifically, I am requesting documentation of illegal funds funneled through Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.7 and 13.11 to Belin McCormick Law Firm, which incorporated LS2Group using funds passed via ISU Veterinary Services Corporation.\r\n\r\nUnauthorized Attorney Fees for Whistleblower Retaliation\r\nRecords of unauthorized private attorney fees paid by the City of Clive to Nyemaster and the City of Ankeny to Brick Gentry for matters relating to whistleblower retaliation following my May 15, 2024, whistleblower email to Senator Grassley. Note that your assistant Angela Studeman concealed this whistleblower email from the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board at their October 2024 meeting.\r\n\r\nState of Iowa Trial Exhibits in State v. Brewbaker (Polk 2019)\r\nCopies of all trial exhibits used in State v. Brewbaker (Polk 2019), which the Assistant Attorney General failed to file in the magistrate court EDMS system, obstructing my discretionary review and subsequent February 2020 PCR filing, which was never docketed in the district court due to wire fraud by the Polk County Clerk.\r\n\r\nMedicaid Billing for 2020 Detainment\r\nThe total amount billed to Iowa Medicaid during 2020 for my Iowa Code 229 involuntary detainment, during which I was defrauded of 812 credits in connection with the aforementioned case.\r\n\r\nAdmission of Embezzlements in 2022 Campaign Statements\r\nDocumentation related to Attorney General Bird\u2019s acknowledgment of embezzlements in her 2022 campaign, referred to as \"Tom Miller's slush fund,\" including the $1.8 million kickback received from RAGA through structured $30,000 donations by Husch Blackwell and Husch Blackwell Strategies (as documented in their IRS Form 990 filings). This information should be included in an amended Iowa False Claims Act 2024 annual report for oversight by the Iowa Senate along with information of Iowa Code 229 missing invoices to county auditors.\r\n\r\nAdditional Context:\r\nIt appears that the Iowa Fifth Judicial District Court Administrator removed your office from EDMS access to State ex rel Brewbaker v. Thomas John Miller (Polk 2017). Additionally, the State Court Administrator is reportedly violating a federal settlement agreement to no longer conceal basic case information, which includes records involving the Iowa Attorney General\u2019s Office.\r\n\r\nThis request aims to ensure compliance with Iowa Code and to enable proper oversight and accountability for public funds and legal processes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nChad Brewbaker",
