Any refusal to provide responsive records must be accompanied by a detailed justification citing specific statutory exemptions.\r\n\r\nFailure to comply with FOIA obligations or provide the requested accommodations will necessitate escalation through administrative appeals, formal complaints to oversight bodies, and judicial remedies.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources\r\nDB.42.131.Inf.\r\nABI Resources https://www.ctbraininjury.com/blog/tags/db-42-131-inf https://x.com/ABIresources/status/1866212331279339765 https://www.youtube.com/@ABI.RESOURCES-CT-ABI-MFP-CARE/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=2\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\r\nConnecticut Attorney General\u2019s Office\r\nRelevant Congressional Oversight Committees\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

DI-25-000310 DI-25-000325 DI-25-000379\r\n\r\nTo:\r\nFOIA Officer\r\nOffice of the Special Counsel (OSC)\r\n1730 M Street, N.W., Suite 218\r\nWashington, D.C. 20036-4505\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. Comprehensive Records on Specified Cases\r\nComplete documentation, communications, and records related to the following cases:\r\n\r\nDavid Medeiros (DI) - Case Open Dates:\r\n\r\nNovember 27, 2024, 7:36 AM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nNovember 28, 2024, 11:13 AM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nDecember 2, 2024, 8:00 AM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nDecember 3, 2024, 2:30 PM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nDecember 5, 2024, 9:11 AM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nDecember 6, 2024, 12:33 PM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nDecember 7, 2024, 5:53 AM \u2013 Case Status: Duplicate/Add'l Info\r\nCase Numbers and Related Details:\r\n\r\nDI-25-000310: Closed as of November 25, 2024\r\nDI-25-000325: Closed as of November 27, 2024\r\nDI-25-000379: Closed as of December 9, 2024\r\n\r\nPattern of Non-Compliance by the Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\r\nI must emphasize that the OSC has repeatedly and willfully failed to comply with clearly outlined ADA accommodation requests, including:\r\n\r\nFailure to Identify FOIA Officers: OSC has continually failed to disclose the names, titles, and roles of FOIA officers and decision-makers responsible for processing previous requests. This omission is concerning and raises significant issues regarding transparency, accountability, and compliance with FOIA mandates.\r\n\r\nThese repeated failures directly violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Rehabilitation Act, and FOIA transparency requirements. It is imperative that the OSC address these concerns immediately and provide the requested accommodations without further obstruction.\r\n\r\n2. Records to Include\r\nCase Files: All records related to OSC\u2019s review, processing, and closure of the above cases.\r\nCorrespondence: Internal and external communications (emails, directives, meeting notes) involving OSC personnel handling these cases.\r\nRationale for Case Status: Specific records detailing the decisions to mark cases as \"Duplicate/Add'l Info\" or to close them, with supporting documentation.\r\nReferrals: Any communications or referrals made to other agencies concerning these cases.\r\nTimeframe\r\nThis request covers records from November 1, 2024, to the present to ensure comprehensive inclusion of all case-related materials.\r\n\r\nADA Compliance\r\nI require all records to be provided in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Please ensure:\r\n\r\nCommunication via MuckRock Platform:\r\n\r\nAll responses, updates, and records must be delivered exclusively via Muckrock. No physical mail, phone calls, external links, passwords or portal-based responses.\r\nDirect Text in Email Body:\r\nProvide summarized responses directly in the email body for accessibility.\r\nScreen-Reader-Compatible PDFs:\r\nAttachments must be clearly labeled, properly formatted, and fully accessible.\r\nSimplified Summaries:\r\nInclude plain-language summaries for complex or technical records to aid comprehension.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis for Request\r\n1. FOIA Compliance (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552)\r\nFOIA mandates full and timely disclosure of requested records unless exemptions explicitly apply.\r\nAny redactions or withholdings must include detailed statutory citations (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)) and clear explanations.\r\n2. ADA Compliance (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160)\r\nPublic entities must ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. Accessible document formatting and accommodations are legally required.\r\n3. Whistleblower Protection\r\nAs the cases directly involve whistleblower disclosures and protections, prompt access to these records is critical to ensure transparency and accountability under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8).\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nThis request is not for commercial purposes. I request a waiver of all fees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), as disclosure of these records serves the public interest in promoting transparency, whistleblower protection, and ADA compliance.\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nExpedited processing is requested under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E) based on:\r\n\r\nSignificant Public Interest: The implications for systemic accountability and whistleblower protections.\r\nUrgency: Timely transparency is necessary to address ongoing ADA compliance concerns and retaliation claims.\r\nIdentification of Personnel\r\nPlease include the names, titles, and roles of all FOIA officers, decision-makers, and supervisory personnel involved in processing this request for transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nDelivery and Response\r\nAcknowledge receipt of this request within five (5) business days.\r\nProvide requested records within the statutory timeframe.\r\nFor any denials or partial redactions, include detailed justifications, appeal instructions, and the name of the reviewing authority.\r\nConsequences of Non-Compliance\r\nFailure to comply with FOIA or ADA requirements may result in:\r\n\r\nAdministrative Oversight: Filing of formal complaints with the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).\r\nLegal Action: Pursuit of remedies under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133.\r\nPublic Advocacy: Escalation through media and public channels to ensure accountability.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDavid Medeiros\r\nFounder, ABI Resources, LLC\r\nDB.42.131.Inf.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Neuroimaging Findings in US Government Personnel and Their Family Members Involved in Anomalous Health Incidents. JAMA. Published March 18, 2024. doi:10.1001/jama.2024.2424\r\n\r\nBesides the doi address above, a web link to the study is https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816532 and the file of the published study is attached to this FOIA request.\r\n\r\nDocuments, memoranda, e-mails, and reports issued by or received by the IRB  related to the study should be collected from January 1, 2017 until December 9, 2024.\r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing\r\n\r\nI am filing this request in my role as a Board Member for Targeted Justice, Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, and a news organization. Targeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 n16.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2). Targeted Justice currently has over 16,000 subscribers and over 130,000 thousand views a month in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\n\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\n\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\n\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLen Ber MD\r\nGlobal Medical Leader\r\nBoard Member\r\nTargeted Justice, Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization\r\n\r\n417 Cardinal Dr.\r\nBloomingdale, IL 60108\r\n\r\nPh: 630-450-7014\r\ne-mail: lenber@protonmail.com\r\nWebsite: www.TargetedJustice.com",
