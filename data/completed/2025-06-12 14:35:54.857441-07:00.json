L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. \r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n1.

Also note that improperly addressed (i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the department number) requests might be returned as undeliverable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 21, 2025:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Data on school-based arrests (Seekonk Police Department)\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record.

And should that exclude classified employees? We can provide job descriptions which would also include grade once you clarify.\r\n\r\nThe \"President's Report\" included all titles for all full-time employees. The collective bargaining agreements we provided do have all salary grades for each of the unions.  The Professional Association covers all non-executive full-time staff & faculty (excluding classified which are covered in the UPSEU CBAs.) Our management confidential positions do not have salary grades.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCrystal\r\n\r\nCrystal Marceau\r\nExecutive Director of Human Resources\r\nPayne Hall 349\r\nMohawk Valley Community College | 1101 Sherman Drive | Utica NY  13501\r\nPhone: 315.792.5637\r\nFax: 315.731.5858\r\n\r\n[cid:image003.png@01DBBA7B.79D38290]\r\n\r\nRelator | Responsibility | Arranger| Individualization | Analytical",

If any 911 calls exist, I request them only if they provide additional relevant details.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nI request a fee waiver as the disclosure of these records serves the public interest in ensuring transparency in law enforcement actions and documenting public safety incidents, rather than for personal or commercial gain.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in digital format via email or a secure online portal if available. If any costs apply, please notify me before processing. If any portion of this request is denied or redacted, please cite the specific exemption under Florida law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance. Please confirm receipt of this request at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPolice Cam News",

The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests take longer than a month to complete.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public.\u00a0 You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

With the FOIAXpress application, the PAL is the best method for EPA to release voluminous records to our Requesters, without encountering MB-limiting firewalls and such transmission impediments.\r\n\r\nThe Agency is working diligently to solve this FOIAXpress issue.  In the interim, we have taken the step to \"push\" a system-generated invitation to create a PAL account to you.  You should receive an email from address noreply_nfo@epa.gov<mailto:noreply_nfo@epa.gov> with instructions on how to take the next steps to successfully establish the PAL account.\r\n\r\nIf you chose to establish this account, this would then ensure that all future interim and final responses from your FOIA requests to EPA will be available for download via the PAL.  It will also allow you to submit any new requests to U.S. EPA using your PAL account.\r\nRegards,\r\nRebecca Clausen, on behalf of the\r\nEPA FOIAXpress Implementation Team",

This could be in the form of training materials on how to quarantine individuals with blood borne pathogens, or training materials for correctional staff on what to do when coming into contact with someone who has a blood borne pathogen. \r\n\r\n2- Any emergency preparedness manuals, directives, or training materials for when a viral outbreak occurs (this could also be referred to as a \u201cpandemic procedure\".)\r\n\r\n3- Any medical directives, memos, regulations, or staff training around prescribing the medical protocol of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis).\r\n\r\n4- Any directives, regulations, manuals, memos, or other training materials given to staff on housing criteria for specific populations (e.g. women, youth, those with illnesses, etc.)\r\n\r\n5- Employee handbook given to correctional staff upon hiring, as well as any employee handbook given separately to medical staff\r\n\r\nI am also requesting the following data and forms:\r\n\r\n1- Aggregate data by month on the number of prisoners with HIV and Hep C for the last two years. If this data exists only in a format that requires creation of a new record, please provide the data in its original format and remove identifying information.\r\n\r\n2- A copy of the standard medical intake form used for prisoners or people held inside the facility.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Elizondo-Pinochi: \r\n\r\nI  previously submitted a public records request to the Nevada Department of Corrections (NDOC) regarding current mental health staff. I was informed that NDOC does not maintain these records and that the Department of Administration (specifically Human Resources) is the custodian, to which I submitted a public records request.\r\n\r\nHowever, the DOA has now replied stating they are not the custodian and referred me back to NDOC. To simplify the request and avoid unnecessary burden, I\u2019d like to narrow the scope to a single question:\r\n\r\nCould you kindly provide the name(s) and contact information (email or phone) for the individual or individuals responsible for overseeing mental health or behavioral health programming within Nevada Department of Corrections facilities \u2014 such as a Chief Psychologist, Mental Health Director, or similar supervisory role?\r\n\t\u2022\tFull name\r\n\t\u2022\tJob title\r\n\t\u2022\tAssigned facility\r\n\t\u2022\tWork email and/or phone number (if available)\r\n\t\u2022\tDepartment (e.g. Behavioral Health)\r\n\r\nI understand many services are contracted out \u2014 if that\u2019s the case, any direction you could offer (e.g. relevant points of contact at the contracting entity) would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nFor context: I\u2019m reaching out as part of a nonprofit initiative exploring the possibility of offering free meditation-based rehabilitation programming to incarcerated populations across the U.S., including Nevada. Similar programs have been successfully implemented in state and federal prisons in the U.S. and abroad, with evidence showing significant benefits to inmate well-being and facility safety.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time and support.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\nAndrew Ma",
