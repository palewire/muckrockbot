In order to\r\n    ensure a comprehensive search for responsive records, I am requesting an\r\n    interagency search for any records that may be held by other law enforcement\r\n    agencies or government entities.\r\n    \r\n    I would also like to reference the Brennan Center's report entitled \"FBI\r\n    Targets a New Generation of Black Activists,\" published on September 13,\r\n    2017, which highlights the FBI's targeting of Black activists. I will be\r\n    attaching the article for your reference.\r\n    \r\n    Specifically, I am seeking any records, reports, memoranda, emails, or other\r\n    documents related to the FBI's surveillance or investigation of Black Lives\r\n    Matter, including any policies, guidelines, or procedures related to this\r\n    surveillance or investigation.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal the response to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request regarding Black Lives Matter, FOIPA Request No.: 1589047-000. I am requesting that the FBI conduct a more thorough search and provide all responsive records.\r\n\r\nIn my initial request, I provided specific key terms and reference points to narrow down the search, yet the response I received stated that there was no attempt made to search for responsive records. This leads me to believe that the search was inadequate in whole, and I request that the FBI conduct a more comprehensive search.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to request an interagency search for any responsive records that may be held by other agencies. As stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(3)(C), agencies are required to make reasonable efforts to search for records that are requested, even if the records are not located within the agency. Given the importance and significance of the Black Lives Matter movement, I believe it is reasonable to assume that other agencies may hold responsive records.\r\n\r\nIn support of my appeal, I would like to cite the case law of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Executive Office of the President, 658 F. Supp. 2d 217, 225 (D.D.C. 2009), which held that agencies must conduct a search that is reasonably calculated to uncover all responsive documents, rather than a search that is cursory or in bad faith. Additionally, I would like to cite the legal principle of agency discretion, which provides that agencies must conduct their searches in good faith and with due diligence.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will reconsider your response to my FOIA request and conduct a more thorough search for responsive records. If you have any questions or require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,",

We have no record of receiving a request email on August 4, 2023.\r\n\r\nPursuant 950 CMR 32.06(2)(g) I write to suggest a reasonable modification of the scope of your request as doing so would enable the City of Somerville to respond and produce any record more efficiently and cost effectively.  A search of all email communications to and from the employees and officials of the City of Somerville involving bike lanes including the word \u201cordinance\u201d will likely return a voluminous number of communications.   I suggest that you please provide a list of City employees and officials that you want a search to be conducted.  I further suggest we search specifically for the words \u201cbike lanes\u201d and \u201cordinance\u201d together and \u201cbicycle lanes\u201d and \u201cordinance\u201d together to better filter the results.\r\n\r\nThe City will send a cost estimate for production of the records upon receipt of your response and reserves the right to seek permission from the Supervisor of Public Records to charge an amount which exceeds the amount otherwise permitted by law to be charged, pursuant to 950 CMR 32.06(4), depending on the scope of work.

We are unable to tell why. So, I am requesting these records: \r\n\r\n1. The FOIA request which you assigned tracking number 2023-03329\r\n\r\n2. The tracking sheet your agency used to track the progress of this FOIA request \r\n\r\n3. Any agency communications describing whether and how to respond to this FOIA request \r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n4. A copy of the documents that responsive to the FOIA request. For this part, please note that some may need to be partially redacted. In your adjudication letter, you threw in a laundry list of exemption codes, but these likely don\u2019t justify withholding 873 pages in full. For B7A specifically, the mere pendency of enforcement proceedings is an inadequate basis for the invocation of B7(A) with showing that some distinct harm could reasonably be expected to result if the record or information requested were disclosed. Miller v. USDA, 13 F.3d 260, 263 (8th Cir. 1993)\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
