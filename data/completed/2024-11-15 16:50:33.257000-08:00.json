In accordance with section 7922.000 of the California Public Records Act, if you claim that any portion of any record is exempt, please redact that portion of the record that you believe is exempt and provide both the statutory citation to any exemption you believe is applicable and the specific reasons for your conclusion that the redacted portion of the record is exempt from disclosure and produce the remainder of the record(s). If you claim that any of the requested records are not a public record, or you claim a privilege not to disclose any record, please respond by identifying any such records and explaining your claim that it is not a public record or why it is privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt, in accordance with section 7922.000. Please produce all records for which you do not claim an exemption or privilege. The California Public Records Act requires determination of whether these records may be disclosed, and specific reasons why any material requested, or portions thereof, are exempt from disclosure, within ten days from receipt of this request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code section 7922.535. It also requires that you notify us of this determination and of the estimated date and time when the records will be produced. See id.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous Anon",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

If your FOIPA Number is [1195846-1] please enter [1195846-001] into the system. If you have any questions about the status of your FOIPA request, please e-mail foipaquestions@fbi.gov.\r\n\r\nFIND STATUS OF FOIPA- Request statuses are updated weekly\r\n\r\nPlease enter the whole FOIPA number-Example: [1234567-000]\r\n\r\nFOIPA:\r\nResults will show the Request Number, Case Type and Process Description shown below:\r\nFOIPA:\r\n1234567-000\r\nCase Type:\r\nFOIPA\r\nProcess Description (Will display the current progress of the request)\r\n\r\nThe FBI\u2019s FOIPA Program is searching the FBI\u2019s indices for potentially responsive documents.\r\n\r\nYou may be contacted via formal letter for all fees and/or negotiation issues that may apply.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Recent requests are entered into the FOIPA database in the order that they are received. Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 360 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.

You had appealed an adverse determination of your request dated 1/23/2024. \r\n\r\nWe have considered your request under the both the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.  After review of the documents, I have determined that portions of documents will be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6 of the Privacy Act and Exemptions 7 of the FOIA as described below. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 5 protects from disclosure those inter- or intra-agency documents that are normally privileged in the civil discovery context.  The three most frequently invoked privileges are the deliberative process privilege, the attorney work-product privilege, and the attorney-client privilege.  After carefully reviewing the responsive documents, I have determined that portions of the responsive documents qualify for protection under the deliberative process privilege/ attorney work-product privilege/ attorney-client privilege/ or all three.  The deliberative process privilege protects the integrity of the deliberative or decision-making processes within the agency by exempting from mandatory disclosure opinions, conclusions, and recommendations included within inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters.  The release of this internal information would discourage the expression of candid opinions and inhibit the free and frank exchange of information among agency personnel. The attorney work-product privilege protects documents and other memoranda prepared by an attorney in contemplation of litigation. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right privacy.  The types of documents and/or information that we have withheld may consist of social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, or various other documents and/or information belonging to a third party that are considered personal.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \r\n\r\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \r\n\r\nExemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I determined that disclosure of law enforcement systems checks could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSupervisory Paralegal Specialist",

Both Eppolito and Caracappa are widely reported as deceased (please see the attached report of the New York Daily News). As such, there are no longer privacy concerns under FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7, nor are there any privacy concerns under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nTo assist in identifying records, the following is known of Eppolito:\r\n\r\nFirst 5 Digits of SSN: 129-36\r\nBOP Registration Number: 04596-748\r\nDate of Birth: 7/22/48\r\nDate of Death: 11/03/2019\r\n\r\nTo assist in identifying records, the following is known of Caracappa:\r\n\r\nFirst 5 Digits of SSN: 115-32\r\nBOP Register Number: 04597-748\r\nDate of Birth: 11/12/41\r\nDate of Death: 04/08/2017\r\n\r\nPlease return a result for a query of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System (NADDIS) using each aforementioned subject's name and (where necessary) accompanying identifying numbers or dates of birth. \r\n\r\nPlease return both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies, across all systems of records. This includes records within the following systems of records (not exclusively): Automated Intelligence Records System (Pathfinder); Investigative Reporting and Filing System (IRFS); Grants of Confidentiality Files (GCF); Operations Files; and Security Files.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the DEA has no other copies of said records.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nT. McElwee\n\n",

        "communication": "Mrs. Starr, Jupiter Police Department,\r\n\r\nAfter an extensive conversation with Mr. King Wekenmann from IS (The Town of Jupiter's IT Department) on 5/28/2024 at 1:50pm, He explained that the desk phones from this request during my time frame of 1/6/2024/-1/16/2024 were provided by AT&T, the records in the custody of AT&T during that time period are public records. As for Cell Phones, police department employees either used AT&T FirstNet or used personal cellphones that would be subsidized by the Town. So first off, Diana's desk phone records will need to be furnished as I have confirmed with AT&T that they maintain records far beyond this date. Secondly, It is irrelevant if Diana has a firstnet phone, a subsidized personal phone or a unsubsidized cell phone. The records will need to be retrieved from her cell phone. If it is a personal phone then while she is \"on the clock\" or \"working\" any actions or information created on her personal phone (ie call records, texts etc.) also creates public records and would need to be retrieved and furnished. This has been upheld by courts across the nation and please consult the town attorney regarding this matter if needed. Now that you are aware of how your phone systems work and operate. Any hesitation to turn over these phone records is no longer negligence.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nMason C. Turner",

We are currently experiencing a high volume of open requests (there are currently 1,370 open requests) and many require additional research such as yours. We are interpreting this request as email records related to the provided domain and therefore we will conduct email search for records from January 1, 2021 through August 30, 2023 with the keywords: @clearview.ai @mg.clearview.ai Please let me know by September 21, 2023, if this clarification is incorrect.\u00a0 If we do not hear from you by then, we will proceed our research with these search parameters. Once we have identified the records we will begin reviewing and preparing them for release. We anticipate our first installment of records to you on or before November 1, 2023 . If we are unable to meet this self-imposed deadline, we will let you know. If we are able to provide a response sooner, we will certainly do so. \r\nYour request is subject to fees as allowed under King County Ordinance 18949 and the Public Records Act, RCW 42.56.120 . Please visit our website  and select \"What is the cost to obtain records\" for more information. Once we have determined the scope of your request and responsive records, we may provide an estimate for fees requiring 10% down prior to processing your request. PLEASE NOTE: Per RCW 42.56.120(4), the KCSO reserves the right to close a records request after 30 days if a requester does not inspect, view, download, and/or pick up the records we provide. There is no obligation for us to continue producing records that are not being collected by a requester. \r\nRCW 42.56.120(4) states that if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. \r\nWAC 44-14-04006(1) states that a records request has been fulfilled and can be closed if an entirely unclear request has not been clarified, a request or installment has not been claimed or reviewed, or the requester cancels the request.

        "communication": "Dear Requester \r\n\r\nI am writing regarding the Public Records Act (PRA) request you submitted to KCDA on 10/11/2022. As you are aware, KCDA has been regularly furnishing responsive records in installments. Installments 13 was sent on 03/22/2024 and has not been claimed. Under the PRA, \u201cIf an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\u201d RCW 42.56.120(4). KCDA\u2019s local policy also states:\r\n\r\n\"Providing Records in Installments \r\n\r\nWhen the request is for a large number of records, the Public Records Officer or designee has the right to provide access for inspection and copying in installments. If, within thirty (30) days, the requestor fails to inspect or claim the entire set of records or one or more of the installments, the Public Records Officer or designee may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request as discussed further below. \r\n\r\n\u2026 \r\n\r\nClosing Withdrawn or Abandoned Request \r\n\r\nThe requestor must claim or review the assembled records within thirty (30) days of KCDA's notification that the records are available for inspection or copying. KCDA should notify the requestor in writing of this requirement and inform the requestor that they should contact KCDA to make arrangements to claim or review the records. If the requestor or a representative of the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, KCDA may close the request and refile the assembled records. \r\n\r\nWhen the requestor either withdraws the request or fails to claim or inspect the records or pay the deposit or final payment for requested copies, the Public Records Officer will close the request and indicate to the requestor that KCDA has closed the request.\"\r\n\r\nBecause this installment of documents responsive to your request have gone unclaimed for over 30 days, KCDA has closed your request, and no further installments will be produced. With the closing of your request, the PRA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of KCDA\u2019s fulfillment of your request has started to run, as KCDA does not intend to take further action on your request. Please advise promptly if you believe that KCDA\u2019s determination that your request has been abandoned is in error, if you have any questions, or if you would like to renew your request. \r\n\r\n\r\nKindest regards,\r\nKristen Deskin, SHRM-SCP\r\nHuman Resources Manager\r\n|Ph: 425-251-8115 x 126 | Fax: 253-395-5402 | Website: www.kcda.org  |Follow us on LinkedIn and Facebook",

I am also not required to respond to false statements made by your agency,  and thus far I have declined to do so.\r\n\r\nYour false statement of 05-22-2024:\r\n\r\n\"I am writing regarding the Public Records Act (PRA) request you submitted to KCDA on 10/11/2022. As you are aware, KCDA has been regularly furnishing responsive records in installments. Installments 13 was sent on 03/22/2024 and has not been claimed. Under the PRA, \u201cIf an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\u201d RCW 42.56.120(4). KCDA\u2019s local policy also states:\r\n\r\n\"Providing Records in Installments\r\n\r\nWhen the request is for a large number of records, the Public Records Officer or designee has the right to provide access for inspection and copying in installments. If, within thirty (30) days, the requestor fails to inspect or claim the entire set of records or one or more of the installments, the Public Records Officer or designee may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request as discussed further below.\"\r\n\r\nAs I have previously stated, no installments have gone unclaimed. This statement is false.

Emails with attachments have provided the name of attachments, is this sufficient to meet your request?\r\n2. You were provided installments related to personal files part of this request with adequate time to review, has this part of the request been filled to you meet your expectations?\r\n\r\nOnce KCDA is able to gain more clarity from you, will be able to continue providing installments.\"\r\n\r\nRESPONSE:\r\n\r\n1. Have all records responsive to this request been produced? Have all agency claims of exemption been properly documented and have contemporaneous exemption logs  been provided? This is the standard for which records responsive to this request are required to be produced.\r\n\r\n2. The original records request does not reference \"expectations\" of any kind.  Have all records responsive to this request been produced? Have all agency claims of exemption been properly documented and have contemporaneous exemption logs  been provided?\r\n\r\nORIGINAL PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST DATED 10-11-2022:\r\n\r\nPursuant to Washington State Public Records Law RCW 42.56, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUEST PART 1: THREE (3) EMPLOYEE PERSONNEL FILES\r\n\r\nI request the complete non-exempt Personnel File, including all payroll files, timesheets, absence & tardiness, disciplinary actions, W-2's, travel and expense reimbursements, any and all additional appropriations on behalf of (for example conference attendance reimbursements, hotel and flight vouchers, etc.) resumes, letters of recommendation and all other nonexempt hiring-related documents, position descriptions, compensation records, information on benefit enrollment, attendance records, performance evaluations and information about all other employment-related actions (e.g., promotions, training, or any disciplinary action), and any other non-exempt job-related information available for the for the following current or former employee of the King County Directors Association:\r\n\r\nDAVID SCOTT MALHALKO\r\nYOHAN LEE\r\nKAREN KAY DESKIN\r\n\r\nPlease provide all responsive records available for the time period 2017 \u2013 Present.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUEST PART 2: EMAIL RECORDS 2017-PRESENT\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of the email server .PST file for the email account associated with the following three (3) email addresses for the time period 2017 \u2013 Present:\r\n\r\ndmalhalko@kcda.org\r\nylee@kcda.org\r\nkdeskin@kcda.org\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of these email records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing responsive email records in REVERSE chronological order by date, producing the most recent messages and records first.\r\n\r\nSEARCH FOR RESPONSIVE RECORDS\r\n\r\nYour agency\u2019s search for responsive email records should involve a good-faith search of all public employee personal devices reasonably believed to contain requested responsive records regardless the type of device or account from which the communication was generated or where the device or data is stored (including personal devices such as personal cell phones, laptops, tablets, and/or computers etc. used from home to conduct public business during the COVID-19 Pandemic). Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wa.2d 863 (2015).\r\n\r\nAlso, please provide a reasonably detailed, nonconclusory affidavit attesting to the nature and extent of any search of any privately owned public employee computer, device, or account.\r\n\r\nFORMAT OF PRODUCTION OF RESPONSIVE RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all requested email records in their NATIVE electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records as stored in their NATIVE .pst (personal storage table) format as stored on agency email servers.\r\n\r\nIf these email records cannot be produced in this NATIVE .pst format, explain in exact technical and procedural detail under the Washington State Public Records Act (RCW 42.56) WHY these electronic records cannot be produced as the electronic records are NATIVELY stored.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure any agency redactions or exemptions claimed in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. Again, this request does not seek a list of any kind and is NOT FOR A COMMERICAL PURPOSE.\r\n\r\nPRIOR DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS\r\n\r\nIf any potentially relevant records have been destroyed, please provide copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation pertaining to, mentioning, or describing said transfer or destruction, including, but not limited to, a statement that your agency has no additional copies of the records in question.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure any agency redactions or exemptions claimed in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety.\r\n\r\n*** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***",

The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.",

        "communication": "Dear Requester \r\n\r\nI am writing regarding the Public Records Act (PRA) request you submitted to KCDA on 10/11/2022. As you are aware, KCDA has been regularly furnishing responsive records in installments. Installments 17th and 18th were sent on 03/29/2024 and 4/19/2024 respectively, neither of which have been claimed. Under the PRA, \u201cIf an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.\u201d RCW 42.56.120(4). KCDA\u2019s local policy also states:\r\n\r\n\"Providing Records in Installments \r\n\r\nWhen the request is for a large number of records, the Public Records Officer or designee has the right to provide access for inspection and copying in installments. If, within thirty (30) days, the requestor fails to inspect or claim the entire set of records or one or more of the installments, the Public Records Officer or designee may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request as discussed further below. \r\n\r\n\u2026 \r\n\r\nClosing Withdrawn or Abandoned Request \r\n\r\nThe requestor must claim or review the assembled records within thirty (30) days of KCDA's notification that the records are available for inspection or copying. KCDA should notify the requestor in writing of this requirement and inform the requestor that they should contact KCDA to make arrangements to claim or review the records. If the requestor or a representative of the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the thirty-day period or make other arrangements, KCDA may close the request and refile the assembled records. \r\n\r\nWhen the requestor either withdraws the request or fails to claim or inspect the records or pay the deposit or final payment for requested copies, the Public Records Officer will close the request and indicate to the requestor that KCDA has closed the request.\"\r\n\r\nBecause these installments of documents responsive to your request have gone unclaimed for over 30 days, KCDA has closed your request, and no further installments will be produced. With the closing of your request, the PRA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review of KCDA\u2019s fulfillment of your request has started to run, as KCDA does not intend to take further action on your request. Please advise promptly if you believe that KCDA\u2019s determination that your request has been abandoned is in error, if you have any questions, or if you would like to renew your request. \r\n\r\n\r\nKindest regards,\r\nKristen Deskin, SHRM-SCP\r\nHuman Resources Manager\r\n|Ph: 425-251-8115 x 126 | Fax: 253-395-5402 | Website: www.kcda.org  |Follow us on LinkedIn and Facebook",

The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.",

The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011).

The locations associated with this incident are either 2700 N Sheffield Ave, Chicago, IL, 60614, or the intersection of W 63rd St & S Knox Ave, Chicago, IL, 60629. The original request sought the following: Incident Reports, 911 Audio, Dispatch Recordings, Body Cam Footage, and a CAD Log. However, the request was denied in full on the grounds of being overly broad in scope. I would like to emphasize that, under FOIA guidelines, if certain portions of a request are deemed too broad or are otherwise exempt, the department should not deny the request in full. Instead, the agency is obligated to produce any non-exempt records that are reasonably identifiable and within scope. Additionally, Incident Reports are a standard type of document routinely requested and disclosed by this agency. In fact, I have previously received such reports from the Chicago Police Department without the need for separate or narrowed requests. I respectfully request that this standard practice be applied to this case as well. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate this process, I am submitting a revised, narrower request:\r\n\r\nIncident Report: Any incident or police report(s) prepared in connection to a November 5th, where police responded to a report of an election judge striking another individual with a cane at a polling site.

        "communication": "Dear Department of Defense, Freedom of Information Policy Office,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of myself and Fiat Fiendum, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3), as to your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency, corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1):\r\n\r\n1. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(5) deliberative process privilege exemption claim, whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2002\r\n2. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(1) classified records exemption claim \u2014 including a Glomar \"refuse to confirm or deny\" response \u2014 whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2016\r\n3. a CSV formatted spreadsheet of all such determinations/Glomars, including the FOIA tracking ID, request, exemptions/Glomar claimed, component agency, number of records found, and all other information available in your current or at-the-time FOIA tracking software or other FOIA processing records held in bulk, database, or spreadsheet form\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the age of the underlying records, please ignore the text \", about records that were created before before Jan. 1, 2002\" in item 1, and \", created before Jan. 1, 2016\" in item 2 \u2014 i.e. you may have false positives (additionally disclosing exemptions about records that are from 2002 or later), but not false negatives (failing to disclose exemptions about records that are from before 2002, e.g. because your search fails to include exemption letters about records whose creation date you didn't track). For item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the subtype of (b)(5) exemption claimed, please ignore the text \"deliberative process privilege\" \u2014 i.e. include all (b)(5) claims. If you are unable to do either without false negatives, item 1 would read \"all FOIA determination letters that have ever made a (b)(5) exemption claim, whenever issued\".\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search. Please mind that items 1 & 2 refer to the age of the underlying record for which an exemption (including Glomar) claim was made \u2014 not to the age of the exemption claim or date of the FOIA request that triggered it. The dates of the request or exemption claim are irrelevant. For example, a 2015 (b)(5) deliberative process denial of a FOIA request made in 2010 about records created in 2000 would be in scope.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and made determinations for all records requested;\r\n* your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for both items;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* Congress determined in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Puib. L. 114-195 that 25 year old (b)(5) deliberative process records are of public interest, and the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.
