This includes but is not limited to his work as a national security advisor to the U.S. President in the 1960s, 1970s, and in subsequent decades. \r\n\r\nBorn May 27th, 1923 in F\u00fcrth, Bavaria, Germany, Henry Alfred Kissinger died November 29th, 2023 in Kent, Connecticut. He is well known for many things including having said: \"The illegal we do immediately, the unconstitutional takes a little longer\" in a diplomatic cable in 1975. I also request documents that include or reference this quote even if it is otherwise unattributed to Dr. Kissinger.\r\n\r\nHe was a German citizen until being stripped of his citizenship in 1935 by the Nazi regime in Germany at the time. It is reported that he was then stateless until becoming an American citizen in 1943. His death at the age of 100 was widely reported in the media in late in November of 2023. He is also known by the name Dr. Kissinger or simply Kissinger.\r\n\r\nMajor media outlets across America and internationally as of late 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/29/us/henry-kissinger-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Henry Alfred Kissinger.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Henry Alfred Kissinger.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8).

This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public. I have previously been determined to meet the criteria for a full fee waiver under journalistic and academic requester status.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am writing to request a copy of any FBI files on John Richard Pilger. I am seeking records relating to or mentioning John Richard Pilger personally, and as well any records relating to John Richard Pilger's work as an investigative journalist and as a public figure involved in investigating many international stories in the public interest. This includes but is not limited to his political work in pledging bail in Britain for the award winning investigative journalist and at the time editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.\r\n \r\nBorn October 9th, 1939 in Bondi in New South Wales, Australia, John Richard Pilger died December 30th, 2023 in London, England. He was widely acclaimed as an internationally award winning, and extremely well respected investigative journalist. He was an Australian and a British citizen. His death at age 84 was widely reported in the media in late December of 2023 and in January 2024. He is also known by the name John Pilger.\r\n\r\nMajor media outlets across America and internationally as of early 2024 have reported his death including: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/business/media/john-pilger-dead.html \r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to John Richard Pilger.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about John Richard Pilger.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to John Richard Pilger.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on John Richard Pilger including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nJohn Richard Pilger was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public. I have previously been determined to meet the criteria for a full fee waiver under journalistic and academic requester status. I am however currently waiting for a copy of that determination letter from the FBI. I am able to produce the relevant FOIA reference where this determination was made by the FBI, if that is needed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. The Congressionally mandated ICE Detainee Death Report for Frankline Okpu, who died December 6, 2023, at the GEO-owned Moshannon Valley ICE Processing Center in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania. \r\n2. All emails exchanged between ICE and GEO, ICE and CRCL, and ICE and Congress regarding the publication of the Congressionally Mandated Detainee Death Report sent or received between December 6, 2023, and January 24, 2024. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), I hereby request expedited processing and certify that the following is true and correct pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information collection and dissemination. \r\n2. Frankline Okpu died in ICE custody on December 6, 2023. https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/cameroonian-national-ice-custody-dies\r\n3. Implementing Congressional Appropriations requirements, ICE\u2019s death policy, ICE Directive 11003.5, Section 5.3, paragraph 4, mandates ICE make available to the public a detainee death report on its website within 30 days of a person\u2019s death. See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention/directive11003-5.pdf. \r\n4. The ICE Detainee Death Report for a man who died two days before Frankline, Carlos Juan Francisco, is presently online: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddr_carlosJuanFrancisco.pdf. \r\n5. The ICE Detainee Death Report for Frankline is not online as of the date of this request. \r\n6. Public records received from the Pennsylvania State Police indicate the agency received at least 77 calls for alleged criminal activity at the Moshannon Valley ICE Processing Center between April 2022 and December 2023. https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24373955-psp_final_response_2023-2559\r\n7. At least 22 of those calls involved allegations of drug paraphernalia or possession. At least 19 of those calls involved allegations of rape, attempted rape, sexual assault, or indecent assault. https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24373955-psp_final_response_2023-2559. \r\n8. Frankline Okpu died of a drug overdose\u2014MDMA toxicity\u2014according to toxicology reports by the Clearfield County Coroner\u2019s Report. \r\n9. Between December 2022 and December 2023, there was not a single month that passed in which the Pennsylvania State Police went without receiving a call to investigate alleged criminal activity at Moshannon Valley. \r\n10. In June 2023, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties published its May 2023 Closing Memorandum summarizing investigative findings of multiple violations of detention standards at Moshannon Valley. https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-09/23_0620_crcl-close-summary-ice-moshannon-valley-processing-center-06-20-23.pdf. \r\n11. ICE non-concurred or only partially concurred with at least 20 of 29 of CRCL\u2019s recommendations. \r\n12. Hundreds of noncitizens currently reside inside involuntarily the Moshannon Valley facility. \r\n13. Neither ICE nor any of its oversight bodies has publicly released information revealing the cause and manner of Frankline\u2019s death. \r\n\r\nBased on the above, there is an urgent need to inform the public regarding the facts surrounding Mr. Okpu\u2019s death, and the steps the agency may have taken to prevent harm to other people locked inside Moshannon Valley at government expense.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",
