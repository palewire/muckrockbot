Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nEleni Karen Villios\r\n\r\nEleni Villios\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: 594-34-1984.

Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production. \r\n\r\nIf the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on an alleged investigation, you must certify that the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed. \r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, it is inappropriate to deny production of any responsive material to this request, if the statute of limitations for the motive of investigation has elapsed. \r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB. \r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization. \r\n\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\n\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n//s// Eleni Karen Villios\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for information under the Privacy Act , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.\r\n\r\nThis Request seeks access to: a) any and all records and/or documents that have been prepared, received, transmitted, collected and/or maintained by the FBI, USDOJ, or DHS concerning me or my activities; b) The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) list for the past five (5) years; and c) the list containing all the agencies, entities, private corporations or individuals with whom you have shared the TSDB during the past five (5) years; and d) provide a copy of the Standard Nomination Form or original information that was used to place my name on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned also requests that you remove my name and any aliases from any and all \u201cWatchlists\u201d under your agency's control. Should there be a specific procedure to go about the removal of my name from all of the Watchlists, the undersigned requests that you produce the forms, regulations and procedures associated to such request.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned does not waive my right to appeal any objection to the production of documents listed above under (b) and (c), but agrees to obtain for the time being the page in each of the lists where her name or variations thereof appear. In consideration of the undersigned's compelling interest and need to stop the illegal targeting, derived from inclusion on the TSDB.\r\n\r\nWhen carrying out the search, please do so under all of these names and aliases:\r\n\r\nEleni Karen Villios\r\n\r\nEleni Villios\r\n\r\nTo facilitate your search, please note that my social security number is: 594-34-1984. Date of birth is 04-17-82.  Place of birth is Miami, Florida\r\n\r\nThe term \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d entails copies thereof regardless of form or format and thus can be interchangeably used to include documents in paper, digital, microfilmed or electronic format; photographs, lists, flowcharts, reports, correspondence, complaints, memoranda, presentations, advisories, emails, or any other tangible form containing information relating to the undersigned in any of the name forms set for the above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 522(a)(1)(D) items (b) and (c) of the documents requested above should be readily produced inasmuch as they have been requested by the general public more than three times.\r\n\r\nWhere a document contains information that falls into one or more of the categories described above, I seek the entirety of that document. Please disclose all segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).\r\n\r\nSince the agency has a duty to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form, I request that responsive electronic records be provided electronically in their native file format. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(B). Alternatively, I request that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, static-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency\u2019s possession, and in separate, Bates-stamped files.\r\n\r\nShould you refuse to produce a record under a statutory privilege or exemption, I ask that you list and describe the document omitted and set forth with specificity the grounds for exempting its production. \r\n\r\nIf the reason for failing to produce any of the documents and/or information requested herein lies on an alleged investigation, you must certify that the statute of limitations for the alleged crime(s) being investigated has not elapsed. \r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that the undersigned has never been accused or convicted of any crimes, it is inappropriate to deny production of any responsive material to this request, if the statute of limitations for the motive of investigation has elapsed. \r\n\r\nIn tandem with the legal provision that requires your reply to this request within 20 days, I have a compelling need that justifies that you carry out an expedited processing of this request pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E). Namely, the urgent need to stop the illegal targeting, resulting from inclusion on the TSDB. \r\n\r\nThe undersigned expects a determination regarding expedited processing within ten calendar days. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(I); 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(4).\r\n\r\nIf the cost of the production of the records sought herein exceeds $50.00, I request you first request my authorization. \r\n\r\nI ask that to the extent possible, all replies, correspondence, documents and media be forwarded by means of email.\r\n\r\nPlease send all correspondence and records relating to this request to email.\r\n\r\nIf the documents or records cannot be sent by email, you should send them to the mailing address above.\r\n\r\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n//s// Eleni Karen Villios\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEleni Karen Villios",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all records, documents, and communications responsive to Mr. Crillon C. Payne, II, aka Crillon Payne, aka Cril Payne  (May 28, 1943 \u2013 June 18, 2006). Mr. Payne worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation between the years of 1968 and 1976 as an undercover agent investigating domestic terrorist groups in the antiwar movement. He wrote a memoir about his experiences of his time at the Bureau which was published by Newsweek Books in 1979 as \"Deep Cover: An FBI Agent Infiltrates the Radical Underground\". In the book, Mr. Payne states that he was given informant designation \"LA 7852-S (Extremist)\" as part of a Domestic Intelligence Division operation known as the Special Informant Development Program (SPECTAR). According to Mr. Payne, this operation was created to target terrorist group the Weather Underground. As such, I am requesting all records related to Mr. Payne under all previously stated permutations of his name, LA 7852-S (Extremist), and LA 7852-S.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. Payne's privacy, as he passed away on June 18, 2006. Privacy rights are not extended to deceased persons. I have attached a reproduction of Mr. Payne's obituary in the Austin American-Statesman. For expediency's sake, I am including a link here: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/statesman/name/crillon-payne-obituary?id=26854114\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mr. Payne publicly revealed his work with the the Bureau in his memoir, removing any further concerns over privacy. The fact that he published a memoir about his undercover work would also make him a figure of public interest; \"Deep Cover\" received media attention in national newspapers and on radio stations at the time of its publication.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including Covert Action Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
