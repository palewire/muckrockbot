These years are both approximate and inclusive. \r\n\r\nPreemptively addressing FOIA exemption concerns:\r\n\u2022 These records concern a case that can be safely assumed to be closed and in no danger of being compromised, given that Rosenthal's case is noted as convicted 1984 and his death was recorded in 2018. \r\n\u2022 Proof of Rosenthal's death is attached, in the form of a printout from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator (Register Number as 08075-020) noting his status as \"Deceased.\"\r\n\u2022 Proof of the case's resolution is attached in the form of a UPI record of conviction (\"AROUND THE NATION; 9 Convicted in Atlanta On Cocaine Smuggling (Published 1984)\". The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/27/us/around-the-nation-9-convicted-in-atlanta-on-cocaine-smuggling.html\u200c)\r\n\u2022 In the balancing test of privacy concerns against public interest, the privacy concerns are minimal (the case was tried decades ago, was a public event, and at least Rosenthal is deceased). Meanwhile the public interest in such the historical study of OCDETF cases has been established by reviews of the Management Information System by the National Archives.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nT. McElwee",
