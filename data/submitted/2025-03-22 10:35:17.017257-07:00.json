Part 304. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 904(a)(2) further supports his appointment and states that the Commissioner of Social Security \u201cmay procure services of experts and consultants in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of section 3109 of title 5.\u201d His duties currently relate to improper payments and SSA\u2019s Death Master File (records maintained by SSA on deceased individuals). SSA is currently working with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to effectuate an interagency agreement for Employee 1 to be detailed temporarily to SBA. \r\n\r\n\"On February 18, 2025, we began onboarding and training Employee 3, a Schedule C Policy Advisor, detailed from the Department of Labor to SSA. The agreement finalizing his onboarding is dated February 22, 2025. His duties currently relate to improper payments and SSA\u2019s Death Master File (containing information about decedents from SSA records). \r\n\r\n\"On February 18, 2025, we began onboarding and training Employee 5, an engineer, detailed from the United States DOGE Service to SSA. The agreement finalizing his\r\nonboarding is an Interagency Agreement with U.S. Digital Service (now U.S. DOGE Service) covering Fiscal Year 2025, which was amended February 20, 2025 to recognize the change to U.S. DOGE Service; extend the duration to July 4, 2026; and modify and supplement certain terms in the original agreement. The agreement authorizes work to include, but does not limit work to, increasing efficiency and the modernization of SSA IT infrastructure and systems, detecting waste, fraud, and abuse. \r\n\r\n\"On February 18, 2025, we began onboarding and training Employee 2, Senior Advisor (Program Specialist AD-0301-00). He is in the process of being detailed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to SSA. The agency is waiting on final signature on the interagency detail agreement from NASA. His duties currently include serving as the DOGE lead at SSA\r\n\r\n\"On February 19, 2025, Employee 10, a software engineer, was detailed from the Office of the Administrator at the General Services Administration to SSA. His duties currently include supporting the leadership team with the assessment and enhancement of internal processes and operational procedures, specifically, focusing on identifying inefficiencies and areas for improvement and ensuring that the administrative and programmatic functions align with the best practices for effectiveness and accountability. \r\n\r\n\"On February 26, 2025, Employee 8, an engineer, was detailed from Office of Personnel Management to SSA. His duties currently relate to improper payments and death data.\r\n\r\n\"On February 27, 2025, Employees 4, 6, and 9 were each appointed as an expert, special government employee under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 and 5 C.F.R. Part 304. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7904(a)(2) further supports their appointment and states that the Commissioner of Social Security \u201cmay procure services of experts and consultants in accordance with the provisions of section 3109 of title 5.\u201d All three of these individuals\u2019 duties currently relate to improper payments and death data.\r\n\r\n\"On March 5, 2025, the agency began onboarding Employee 7, as a detailee from Department of Labor (DOL) to SSA. The agency is waiting on final signatures on the interagency detail agreement from DOL. His duties currently relate to improper payments. \r\n\r\nI would like to request the following information:\r\n1. For the SGEs, I would like to receive whatever publicly shareable details can be made of their appointments, including if they signed SF-61s\r\n2. For the detailees, I would like to see their detailing agreements made with the other agency governing the scope of work and who they report to, etc.\r\n3. For the SGE potentially being detailed to the Small Business Administration, I would like to see that agreement\r\n4. I would like to request \"Signed Acknowledgements of SSA Information Security and Privacy Awareness Training, which covers requirements for compliance with information security and privacy policies of SSA.\" for both the SGEs and detailees.\r\n\r\nI expect the timespan for this inquiry to be in February 2025, but it does seem like there might be a pre-existing USDS detailing arrangemnt for Employee 5.

LEGAL BASIS AND PRECEDENT\r\nThis request is made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f552 and is supported by the following legal authorities and judicial precedents, which mandate exhaustive and complete searches for all relevant documents:\r\n\r\nDepartment of Justice v.

Federal Trade Commission, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015) and Carney v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814 (2d Cir. 1994), support fee waivers for requests that enhance governmental transparency.\r\nIf fees are expected to exceed $100, please contact me prior to proceeding further.\r\n\r\nVII.

ADMINISTRATIVE TRACKING AND SEARCH DOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\nIn compliance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f552(a)(6)(A)(i) and relevant case law, please include with your response:\r\n\r\nThe tracking number assigned to this request.\r\nThe name(s) of the FOIA personnel responsible for processing this request.\r\nA detailed description of the search methodology employed, including all systems, databases, repositories, and local storage locations searched.\r\nThe exact search terms used (including Boolean operators and any modifications).\r\nDate ranges for each search.\r\nDocumentation of personnel involved and the time spent on each search.\r\nCopies or summaries of search logs, including timestamps and result counts.\r\nCertification by the designated Information Management Officer that all potentially responsive records were searched.\r\n\r\nXI. RIGHT TO APPEAL AND JUDICIAL REVIEW\r\n\r\nI expressly reserve my right to appeal any adverse determination regarding this request, including:\r\n\r\nDenials of expedited processing or fee waivers.\r\nInsufficient or inadequate searches.\r\nWithholdings or redactions based on FOIA exemptions.\r\nAny such determination shall be subject to immediate judicial review as provided under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f552(a)(4)(E) and other applicable law.\r\n\r\nXII. PREVIOUS EVIDENCE OF INTERACTION\r\n\r\nThere is extensive, independently documented evidence of interactions between U.S. Border Patrol personnel and militia groups. Specifically:\r\n\r\nSouthern Poverty Law Center Report: In Plain Sight: Uncovering Border Patrol\u2019s Relationship with Far-Right Militias at the Southern Border (\u200b\r\nSPLCENTER.ORG\r\n) details multiple instances of such interactions in Arizona.\r\nWIRED Report: Border Militias Prepare to Assist With Donald Trump\u2019s Mass Deportation Plans (\u200b\r\nWIRED.COM\r\n) describes contacts between militia groups like Arizona Border Recon and federal officials.\r\nAdditional Investigative Reports: Articles from the Los Angeles Times and TIME (\u200b\r\nLATIMES.COM\r\n; \r\nTIME.COM\r\n) corroborate historical and ongoing patterns of informal cooperation or tacit approval between Border Patrol personnel, local law enforcement, and vigilante groups.\r\nThese independent sources establish a clear pattern of interaction that underscores the public interest in obtaining full disclosure of the requested records.\r\n\r\nXIII. SUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENTATION AND SUBSTATION RECORDS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records explicitly described above, please produce any supplementary or \u201csubstation\u201d records that are relevant to the processing of this request. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\nAdditional memos, internal correspondence, briefing materials, or working documents not otherwise specifically identified herein that discuss or reference the search process, procedures, or any additional documentation related to interactions between U.S. Border Patrol and the specified militia groups.\r\nAll administrative reports, summaries, or analyses prepared by FOIA or records management personnel that elucidate the methodology, limitations, or findings related to the search for responsive records.\r\nAny documentation from U.S. Customs and Border Protection substations located in Texas, Arizona, or any other relevant border states\u2014including records, communications, internal memos, and operational reports\u2014that pertain to interactions or cooperation with the aforementioned militia groups or their representatives.\r\nAny records maintained at regional or substation offices that support the production of records responsive to this request.\r\nPlease confirm receipt of this request and provide a tracking number within five (5) working days, as required under FOIA. If any portion of this request is unclear or if additional information is required, please contact me immediately. I further request that no delay tactics or improper denials be employed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt, full, and legally compliant disclosure of these records.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nInvestigative Journalist",

Please use the following unique FOIA tracking number CBP-FO-2025-088795 to track the status of your request.  If you have not already done so, you must create a SecureRelease account. This is the only method available to check the status of your pending FOIA request. \n\nProvisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations. By submitting your request, you have agreed to pay up to $25.00 in applicable processing fees, if any fees associated with your request exceed this amount, CBP shall contact you. \nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request.  Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, CBP processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.  Although CBP\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c).  [As your request seeks documents that will require a thorough and wide-ranging search, CBP will invoke a 10-day extension for your request pursuant to 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). If you would like to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office.  We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.] \n\nCBP\u2019s FOIA Division is working hard to reduce the amount of time necessary to respond to FOIA requests.  We truly appreciate your continued patience. \nFor additional information please consult CBP FOIA website please click on FOIA Act Resources or visit http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

Part 5 \u00a7 5.3(b) of the DHS FOIA regulations, you must describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search of appropriate systems of records can find them with a reasonable amount of effort. Your FOIA request has been closed as insufficient because you did not include a clear and detailed description of the records being requested. Please be advised that the FOIA does not require federal agencies to answer inquiries or create records in response to a FOIA request, but rather is limited to requiring agencies to provide access to reasonably described, nonexempt records. As you have failed to reasonably describe the records you are seeking, your request is not a perfected request, and we are unable to initiate a search for responsive records. Please provide whom in senior leadership (names or titles is ok to as well) you wish the emails searches and for your search terms most of them are overly broad and need to be narrowed. Lastly, not all MuckRock requests are considered media, please provide credentials that you are a member of the media to be considered for the fee waiver. \n\nPlease be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. Please resubmit your FOIA request, along with the required information, by logging into your existing SecureRelease account. \n\nPlease note that this message has been sent from an unmonitored e-mail account.

On Tuesday, April 23rd of 2013, the Twitter account of the Associated Press was taken over by hackers who sent out tweets claiming that the White House had been struck by two bomb blasts and that President Obama had been injured. \r\n\r\nCoverage of this event can be read here: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/23/ap-tweet-hack-wall-street-freefall\r\n\r\nThese hoax tweets contributed to a 143 point drop in the Dow Jones and highlighted the dangers of hoaxes in markets that rely on high frequency trading. The hoax and their aftermath was commented upon by Jay Carney that day and led the broadcast channel newscasts that evening. This incident has been described as an early example of social media disinformation impacting markets and the public. \r\n\r\nPlease search for materials related to the immediate reaction to those hoax tweets on April 23rd of 2013, as well as continued discussion in the weeks afterward as to their impact. For purposes of this request please limit the search for documents created between April 23rd 2013 and July 23rd 2013. Of particular interest is examinations of the hoax of the markets, internal deliberations about how to combat such threats, and any communication with representatives of Twitter regarding the implementation of \"two-factor authentication\".\r\n\r\nThank you for the commitment to transparency, and I look forward working together to have this request resolved.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
