De Hoyos has never made an arrest, please provide a sworn statement confirming his current employment status and exact dates of service with the McAllen Police Department, from his hire date of September 26, 2022, to the present (March 17, 2025).\r\nArrest Reports: If Officer De Hoyos has made arrests, provide all arrest reports from September 26, 2022, to March 17, 2025, where he is listed as the arresting officer, including:\r\nReport number\r\nDate of arrest\r\nCharges filed\r\nName of the individual arrested\r\nPlease note that records for cases no longer under active investigation are not exempt under TPIA and must be disclosed.\r\nDisciplinary Records: All disciplinary records, internal affairs investigations, reprimands, and citizen complaints involving Officer Edgar I. De Hoyos, from September 26, 2022, to March 17, 2025, including:\r\nDates of incidents\r\nSummaries of allegations\r\nResolutions or outcomes\r\nIf these records are held by the Civil Service Office per your prior referral, please coordinate with that office to fulfill this request or provide their direct contact for a separate submission.\r\nThis request pertains to existing records only, as required under TPIA. Given Officer De Hoyos\u2019 documented role as a Police Officer III in the Tactical Patrol Unit (effective September 9, 2024), it is implausible that no arrest records exist after over two years of service. Be advised that this is part of a broader, ongoing investigation into potential misconduct specifically police brutality, and any failure to comply fully with TPIA may result in escalation to the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office for review.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is deemed exempt, please cite the specific TPIA exemption and provide non-exempt portions as required by law. If a determination from the Texas Attorney General is sought, please provide a copy of that request and the subsequent ruling. I expect a response within 10 business days, per TPIA \u00a7552.221.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Using a decoy package equipped with a tracker, he waited in an unmarked van in a high-theft area. When a known porch pirate attempted to steal the package, Det. Luis apprehended the suspect alone. The suspect was found with dozens of stolen packages in their vehicle. The arrest was captured on body-worn camera footage and praised as a strategic and effective takedown of a package theft ring.\r\nRequested Records:\r\nBody-Worn Camera Footage:\r\n\r\nAll video and audio recordings from Detective Luis Q. and any other responding officers related to the undercover operation.\r\nFootage capturing the moment the suspect attempted to steal the package and their subsequent apprehension.\r\nAny footage showing the recovery of stolen packages.\r\nDash Camera Footage:\r\n\r\nAny available in-car camera recordings from unmarked or marked police vehicles involved in the operation.\r\nIncident and Arrest Reports:\r\n\r\nThe full police report detailing the sting operation and subsequent arrest.\r\nSupplementary reports from any assisting officers or units.\r\nPhotographs:\r\n\r\nAny images taken at the scene, including photos of the decoy package, the suspect\u2019s vehicle, and recovered stolen items.\r\nSurveillance or Third-Party Footage:\r\n\r\nAny surveillance footage collected as evidence, such as home security footage from affected residents.\r\n911 Call or Radio Dispatch Logs:\r\n\r\nAny radio communication or emergency call records related to the operation.\r\nFee Waiver Request:\r\nThe primary goal of this request is to serve the public interest by making the footage and related records publicly accessible. I acknowledge that I may also generate revenue from its dissemination; if a full fee waiver is not possible, please inform me of the estimated costs in advance, and let me know if fees can be reduced or eliminated by removing specific items from the request, specifying which if so.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records in electronic format, if available. If any records are withheld or redacted, kindly specify the reasons and the applicable exemptions under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance.

If you have requested body camera footage, these requests can be lengthy and will cost a minimum average of $80 but could cost several hundred dollars due to many factors: \r\n  * How long was the law enforcement encounter? \r\n  * How many deputies were on scene? \r\n  * How much redaction will be required for public release?\r\n2. If you have requested only paper documentation, these do not require a charge unless the report is length or requires significant redaction. \r\n3. Florida Statute 119 does not require a governmental body to create new information, to do legal research, or to answer questions. \r\nIf any of the above factors change your request, you can reply to this email with the modifications you would like to make.
