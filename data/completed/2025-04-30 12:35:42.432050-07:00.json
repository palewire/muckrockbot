If any 911 calls exist, I request them only if they provide relevant additional details.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\nI request a fee waiver as the disclosure of these records serves the public interest in transparency regarding law enforcement interactions and public disturbances, rather than for personal or commercial gain.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in digital format via email or a secure online portal if available. If any associated fees apply, please inform me before processing. If any portion of this request is denied or redacted, please cite the specific exemption under Ohio law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance. Please confirm receipt of this request at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPolice Cam News",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nBelow are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to your agency and its department head. Your response is required by May 14, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records. Exact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing (SFAC 67.27). \r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26). \r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)). \r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)). \r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)). \r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\n1.  All text or chat messages in any form or application (SMS, MMS, WhatsApp, WeChat, Signal, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Hangouts, Skype, Teams) sent by Dr. Grant Colfax to Mayor Breed OR sent by Mayor Breed to Dr. Grant Colfax, timestamps between Jan 1, 2020 and May 4, 2020 (inclusive), including a personal search under City of San Jose vs Superior Court (2017).  Please also include any group messages where more than Dr. Grant Colfax and Breed are on the message.  While the phone numbers are not needed, the following must be preserved: the timestamps, the textual content, attachments, and images, and also ALL sender and recipient names (including groups).  Pursuant to SF Admin Code 67.21(l), please provide a spreadsheet format or if you will use PDF, do not print and scan.  \r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. The email address sending this request is a publicly- viewable mailbox. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock).

Please do not include any confidential information, as I intend that these communications with the City all be disclosable public records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nGabriel Greschler",

Please also include any group messages where more than Dr. Grant Colfax and Breed are on the message.\u201d \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are providing you texts messages that were sent by Dr. Grant Colfax to Mayor Breed, or sent by Mayor Breed to Dr. Grant Colfax. The responsive text messages were sent or received between March 2, 2020 to May 3, 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nRedactions\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nDPH redacted text messages that contain privileged attorney-client communications. State law renders communications made in confidence as part of the attorney-client relationship between the City Attorney\u2019s Office and City officials and employees privileged. (Cal. Gov\u2019t. Code \u00a7\u00a7 6254(k), 6276.04; Cal. Evid. Code \u00a7 950 et seq.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nCell phone numbers and text messages containing cell phone numbers were redacted under the official information privilege. (Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6254(k).) This privilege is codified in California Evidence Code section 1040, which defines \u201cofficial information\u201d as \u201cinformation acquired in confidence by a public employee in the course of his or her duty and not open, or officially disclosed, to the public prior to the time the claim of privilege is made.\u201d (Id. at \u00a7 1040(a).)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nWithholdings \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, DPH has withheld text messages that include the City Attorney\u2019s Office. The Public Records Act allows an agency to decline to disclose \u201c[r]ecords, the disclosure of which is exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law, including, but limited to, provisions of the Evidence Code relating to privilege.\u201d (Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6254(k).)\u00a0 California Evidence Code section 954 protects from disclosure communications between attorneys and their clients. Disclosure of communications between the DPH and the City Attorney\u2019s Office would chill DPH\u2019s ability to discuss candidly issues on which legal advice is sought.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City and County of San Francisco.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://www.nextrequest.com/support'>help page</a>",

Your response is required by May 14, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records. Exact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color record. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing (SFAC 67.27). \r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26). \r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)). \r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)). \r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)). \r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\n1.  All text or chat messages in any form or application (SMS, MMS, WhatsApp, WeChat, Signal, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Hangouts, Skype, Teams) sent by Dr. Grant Colfax to Mayor Breed OR sent by Mayor Breed to Dr. Grant Colfax, timestamps between May 4, 2020 and July 7, 2020 (inclusive), including a personal search under City of San Jose vs Superior Court (2017).  Please also include any group messages where more than Dr. Grant Colfax and Breed are on the message.  While the phone numbers are not needed, the following must be preserved: the timestamps, the textual content, attachments, and images, and also ALL sender and recipient names (including groups).  Pursuant to SF Admin Code 67.21(l), please provide a spreadsheet format or if you will use PDF, do not print and scan.  \r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations.\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses. Once you send them to us, there is no going back. The email address sending this request is a publicly- viewable mailbox. All of your responses (including all responsive records) may be instantly and automatically available to the public online via the MuckRock.com FOIA service used to issue this request (though the requester is an anonymous user, not a representative of MuckRock).

Representative edited works based on prior FOIA requests like this one may be reviewed here: https://theappeal.org/authors/andrew-free/; and here: https://atlpresscollective.com/2025/01/31/new-record-sheds-light-on-unreported-death-in-atlanta-airport-customs-inspection/. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request pursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 that the following statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding: \r\n1. ICE deaths in custody in FY25 are currently on track to equal or surpass the 12 deaths in the previous fiscal year. \r\n\r\n2. IHSC Mortality Reviews provide an authoritative agency accounting of the medical circumstances of in-custody deaths. These reviews often conflict with the public-facing story the agency tells, raising critical questions about accountability, transparency, waste, fraud, and abuse.

Your request was received in this office on 3/13/2025. Specifically, you have requested all records pertaining to the IHSC Mortality Review for Genry Ruiz-Guillen, (DOB: 11/10/1995; COC: Honduras) who died January 23, 2025, following his detention at the Krome Service Processing Center in Miami, Florida, according to the Detainee Death Report ICE published: https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/ddr-GenryRuizGuillen.pdf.. \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited treatment is hereby denied. \r\n\r\nUnder the DHS FOIA regulations, expedited processing of a FOIA request is warranted if the request involves \u201ccircumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1)(i), or \u201can urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information,\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(l)(ii).  Requesters seeking expedited processing must submit a statement explaining in detail the basis for the request, and that statement must be certified by the requester to be true and correct.  6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(3). \r\n\r\nYour request for expedited processing is denied because you do not qualify for either category under 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.5(e)(1).  You failed to demonstrate a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request beyond the public\u2019s right to know about government activity generally.  Your letter was conclusory in nature and did not present any facts to justify a grant of expedited processing under the applicable standards. \r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued. \r\n\r\nICE has queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington, at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St, SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009. Additionally, you have a right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-ICFO-25062.

        "communication": "I appeal the agency's blanket b7A assertion on two grounds.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is no \"ongoing law enforcement investigation[]\" that could result in a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, as required to invoke Exemption 7A. Rather, the investigations ICE performs following an in-custody death -- IHSC Mortality Reviews, Root Cause Analyses, Healthcare and Security Compliance Analyses, and Detainee Death Reviews, pertain solely to \"oversight of the performance of duties\", rather than an investigation into violations of laws. See, e.g., Jefferson v. DOJ, 284 F.3d 172, 178 (D.C. Cir. 2002). They cannot be fairly characterized, based upon ICE's publicly available policies and procedures and the history of its post-death inspections, to anything constituting an \"enforcement proceeding.\" Consequently, they do not meet Exemption 7A's requirements. Miller v. DOJ, 872 F. Supp. 2d 12, 24-25 (D.D.C. 2012) (explaining that focus is on circumstances of compilation and whether records relate to enforcement proceeding (citing Jefferson 284 F.3d at 176-77)); Rural Hous. All. v. USDA, 498 F.2d 73, 82 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (explaining that purpose of investigatory files is critical factor in establishing law enforcement threshold); Pub. Emps. for Env't Resp. v. U.S. Sec'y. Int'l Boundary & Water Comm'n, 839 F. Supp. 2d 304, 324 (D.D.C. 2012) (explaining that in \"assessing whether records were compiled for law enforcement purposes, the 'focus is on how and under what circumstances the requested files were compiled, and whether the files sought relate to anything that can fairly be characterized as an enforcement proceeding'\" (quoting Jefferson, 284 F.3d at 176-77)), aff'd in pertinent part & rev'd on other grounds, 740 F.3d 195 (D.C. Cir. 2014).\r\n\r\nSecond, even if the agency were able to show its allegedly ongoing investigations satisfy the threshold for invoking Exemption 7A, the blanket assertion of the exemption to all potentially responsive records is unlawful and improper. A record-by-record analysis is required to determine whether there is any reasonably segregable, releasable portion of the responsive documents that would not interfere with the ongoing investigation. But ICE did not conduct this analysis. According to the Department of Justice and every court to review agencies\u2019 assertions of the power to engage in blanket 7A withholdings simply because of the existence of an investigation, blanket withholding is unlawful. See, e.g., https://www.justice.gov/oip/page/file/1197166/download at page 11: \u201cWhile generalized showings of harm are accepted, courts have also cautioned that the exemption [7A] does not permit \u2018blanket\u2019 withholding.\u201d See, e.g., Cuban, 744 F. Supp. 2d at 85 (D.D.C. 2010) (stressing that exemption does not permit \"blanket\" withholding for all records relevant to investigation); UtahAmerica Energy v. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 700 F. Supp. 2d 99, 109 (D.D.C. 2010), rev'd in part, vacated in part sub nom. UtahAmerica Energy, Inc. v. Dep't of Labor, 685 F.3d 1118 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (reiterating that \"automatic, or wholesale withholdings\" are not authorized simply because law enforcement proceeding is ongoing); United Am. Fin. v. Potter, 531 F. Supp. 2d 29, 3840 (D.D.C. 2008) (reiterating that the agency \u2018should be mindful of the standards applicable in this Circuit\" and that even under categorical approach, agency must review each document because there is \"no 'blanket exemption'\"); Gould Inc. v. GSA, 688 F. Supp. 689, 703-04 n.34 (D.D.C. 1988) (describing generic categories approach as steering \"middle ground\" between detail required by Vaughn Index and blanket withholding).\r\n\r\nPlease grant expedited processing of this appeal, reverse the decision of the FOIA office, and remand to the agency with instructions to release the record in full.\r\n\r\nThank you very much,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

My request is for a fully unredacted version of this document.  \r\n\r\nA redact version of this document is accessible from the CIA's FOIA Reading Room: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0005403091.pdf\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that every single Georgian political figure mentioned in this document: Jaba Ioseliani, Tengiz Kitovani, Tengiz Sigua, Eduard Shevardnadze, Giorgi Chanturia, have all now passed away. The history of the early years of independence of Georgia is of ongoing interest to the public, and release of the requested document would further the American and Georgian public's understanding of contemporary observations of this time. In addition, I ask that this request be expedited, considering the historical importance of the document in question, and due to the fact that all the individuals mentioned in said document are now deceased. \r\n\r\nThank you for the CIA's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working towards the granting of this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

        "communication": "Dear U.S. Department of Education,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of myself and Fiat Fiendum, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3), as to your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency, corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1):\r\n\r\n1. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(5) deliberative process privilege exemption claim, whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2002\r\n2. all FOIA determinations that have ever made a (b)(1) classified records exemption claim \u2014 including a Glomar \"refuse to confirm or deny\" response \u2014 whenever issued, about records that were created before Jan. 1, 2016\r\n3. a CSV formatted spreadsheet of all such determinations/Glomars, including the FOIA tracking ID, request, exemptions/Glomar claimed, component agency, number of records found, and all other information available in your current or at-the-time FOIA tracking software or other FOIA processing records held in bulk, database, or spreadsheet form\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the age of the underlying records, please ignore the text \", about records that were created before before Jan. 1, 2002\" in item 1, and \", created before Jan. 1, 2016\" in item 2 \u2014 i.e. you may have false positives (additionally disclosing exemptions about records that are from 2002 or later), but not false negatives (failing to disclose exemptions about records that are from before 2002, e.g. because your search fails to include exemption letters about records whose creation date you didn't track). For item 1, to the extent that you are unable to narrow your search based on the subtype of (b)(5) exemption claimed, please ignore the text \"deliberative process privilege\" \u2014 i.e. include all (b)(5) claims. If you are unable to do either without false negatives, item 1 would read \"all FOIA determination letters that have ever made a (b)(5) exemption claim, whenever issued\".\r\n\r\nThis request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search. Please mind that items 1 & 2 refer to the age of the underlying record for which an exemption (including Glomar) claim was made \u2014 not to the age of the exemption claim or date of the FOIA request that triggered it. The dates of the request or exemption claim are irrelevant. For example, a 2015 (b)(5) deliberative process denial of a FOIA request made in 2010 about records created in 2000 would be in scope.\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version. I specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the original native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and made determinations for all records requested;\r\n* your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for both items;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* Congress determined in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Puib. L. 114-195 that 25 year old (b)(5) deliberative process records are of public interest, and the President determined in EO 13526 that 10\u201325 year old classified records should be declassified, and the records requested would serve as an index for a follow-up request for all such records, to make them widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S. My full legal name is just Sai. Please use no title for me.",

A representative of a person(s) on the report will be subject to a $1.92 redaction cost. \r\nEstimated Cost is $24.79\r\nDue to the high demand for Open Records Request the estimated time is one month.\r\nPlease provide a waiver from the person(s) on the record releasing the images of them, and if any, of minor children present in the report, which would save redaction time. \r\nYou will receive a notice upon completion of processing your request of the Open Record, if a response isn\u2019t received within 10 business days, we will consider the request abandoned and closed. \r\nWe accept Check, Money Order or Cash at the Sheriff\u2019s Office.\r\nMake payment payable to: Sawyer County Sheriff\r\n\r\nRecords will be released upon receiving payment.",

There were no redactions applied to this installment. As I previously stated, I am working with others both within and outside of DAJD to process this request. This request will be quite large and will take over 12 months to complete. At this time, I am unable to provide a more definitive completion estimate as the Care and Closure process is still on-going. I have been advised that there may be thousands of emails and documents/records responsive to this request and they may be held by numerous County agencies and departments. I will need to Coordinate with numerous others to locate, obtain and process all responsive records. My estimate of 12+ months may be wrong and it may end up taking longer than that to complete this request. I have scheduled the next installment for 1/10/2024. Due to the upcoming holidays and needing to coordinate with others, this installment is later than usual and most future installments will not have as long of a timeframe between them. Please contact me if you have any questions.

There were no redactions applied to this installment. I received your email regarding not being able to access the previous installments. I am not quite sure what is going on, as I have not been able to find a solution. If you are able to provide a second email address, I can add that to the OneDrive access to see if that works. If that does not work, I may need to come up with a completely different system for delivering installments to you. With this installment, I have provided all of the reports that have been given to me regarding Care and Closure. I am interpreting your request as, \"a request for documents (including memos) sent by DAJD or received from the Executive's Office related to the CCFJC closure? Is this correct? If so, please confirm \u00a0by 3/22/2024, and I will ensure my colleagues are continuing to collect responsive records. If this is not correct, please let me know and I will re-engage with my colleagues and we will revise our search for records. If you could provide a secondary email address and confirmation of my interpretation by 3/22/24, I would appreciate it. If I hear back from you, I have scheduled the next installment of records for no later than the end of the day on 4/4/2024. I will also provide a link to this installment in a separate email. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Our office receives over 12,000 records requests annually, one of our main priorities is to provide those responsive records to your request in a reasonable timeframe and as efficiently as possible. In order to do that we would like to work with you to identify possible ways to narrow your request so that we are only searching for and reviewing those records that contain the information you are looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, the most time intensive records to review are APD lapel video (a 1-hour recording requires 3-4 hours to review and redact). In most cases, the first responding officer\u2019s lapel video contains the information most requesters seek. If you are able to narrow/tailor your request to that officer\u2019s lapel it can avoid tens to hundreds of hours of review and redaction (which results in additional time needed to respond to your request).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you choose to proactively reach out to our office, we will work with you to better understand your records request and will offer suggestions on ways your request can be further specified to obtain those records you seek as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis invitation to contact our office to narrow your request is voluntary and does not alter any of your rights to inspect public records under the New Mexico Inspection of Public Records Act. If you decline our offer to assist in narrowing your request, we will conduct a reasonable search and process your request accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, if you have or later acquire documents relating to your request, please let us know and upload the records into NextRequest. Such additional information has proven to be a useful resource in identifying, locating, and producing additional records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDominic Leyba\r\n\r\nIPRA Tech\r\n\r\nOffice of the City Clerk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Albuquerque.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

NOTE: This includes: all but the last four digits of a (1) taxpayer ID number; (2) financial account number; (3) credit/debit card number; (4) driver\u2019s license number; AND (5) all but the year of a person\u2019s date of birth; AND (6) social security number; AND (7) nonelected government employee\u2019s home street address, but not the city state or zip code. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have redacted portion(s) of the records because they are exempt from disclosure under IPRA, NMSA 1978, Section 14-2-1(A) (medical records); Section 14-6-1(A) (medical records); Section 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including NMRA Rule 11-504 (physician-patient and psychotherapist-patient privilege)). See generally 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 160, 164 (HIPAA). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also determined it was necessary and appropriate to redact/blur the officers\u2019 computer screen videos to avoid potential disclosure of information from the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC). See\u00a0NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1.2(A)(7) (confidential sources, methods or information); \u00a7 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.21-21, .33). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also redacted certain information which could reveal the identities of undercover police officers or informants.\u00a0This information is exempt from the Inspection of Public Records Act.\u00a0See\u00a0NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1.2(A)(7) (confidential sources, methods or information). If made public, the redacted information would seriously interfere with the effectiveness of criminal investigations and prosecutions, and endanger undercover police officers or informants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also redacted/exempted certain tactical information pursuant to\u00a0NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1(I) (tactical response plans or procedures). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also redacted/exempted some confidential law enforcement information.\u00a0See\u00a0NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1 (D) (law enforcement records), including \u00a714-2-1.2(A)(7) (confidential sources, methods or information). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have redacted portion(s) of the records because they are exempt from disclosure under IPRA, NMSA 1978, \u00a714-2-1.2(A)(5); and NMSA 1978, Section 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including the City of Albuquerque\u2019s Open Records Ordinance, ROA 1994, Section 2-7-6-5(C)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsive records:\r\n\r\n* * Lapel Videos - Part 1 (shared via Evidence.com at no charge)\r\n\r\n* Please let us know if the provided videos will satisfy this request or if you still want additional lapel videos. The videos provided include those from the officer most directly related in the incident along with several others. There are approximately 171 lapel videos related to this request. Reviewing videos to make ready for release takes approximately 2-4 times as long as just watching the video itself, so it is a time-consuming process. If you do want additional lapel videos, if you can narrow your request in any way (such as, to specific officers or events), your request may be fulfilled sooner. Otherwise, it will take a significant amount of time for all the videos to be reviewed and made available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPending records:\r\n\r\n* * Additional Lapel Videos (if requested)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lapel videos responsive to your request were shared with you via Evidence.com; you will receive a link from Evidence.com which will prompt you to create an account in order to view the videos. If you did not receive the link from Evidence.com, please check your junk/spam folder. Please be advised: you cannot share or forward the link from Evidence.com, because this will void the link and you will not be able to access the videos. Additionally, the videos are only active for 90-days, but you may download them at no charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis list reflects my understanding of the records that have been completed and processed and the records on which we are still working.\u00a0If you have a different understanding or believe there are other records outstanding, please contact me as soon as possible.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will be notified when additional records become available. Thank you for your continued patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any issues, please contact the City Clerk's office at (505) 924-3650 for assistance in troubleshooting.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER C.

Your request is still open with our office, and we apologize for the delay.\u00a0We will be in touch as we have additional information about your request or as we complete processing your records.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if the provided videos will satisfy this request or if you still want additional lapel videos.\u00a0The videos provided include those from the officer most directly related in the incident along with several others.\u00a0There are approximately 171 lapel videos related to this request. Reviewing videos to make ready for release takes approximately 2-4 times as long as just watching the video itself, so it is a time-consuming process.

Our office receives over 12,000 records requests annually, one of our main priorities is to provide those responsive records to your request in a reasonable timeframe and as efficiently as possible. In order to do that we would like to work with you to identify possible ways to narrow your request so that we are only searching for and reviewing those records that contain the information you are looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, the most time intensive records to review are APD lapel video (a 1-hour recording requires 3-4 hours to review and redact). In most cases, the first responding officer\u2019s lapel video contains the information most requesters seek. If you are able to narrow/tailor your request to that officer\u2019s lapel it can avoid tens to hundreds of hours of review and redaction (which results in additional time needed to respond to your request).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you choose to proactively reach out to our office, we will work with you to better understand your records request and will offer suggestions on ways your request can be further specified to obtain those records you seek as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis invitation to contact our office to narrow your request is voluntary and does not alter any of your rights to inspect public records under the New Mexico Inspection of Public Records Act. If you decline our offer to assist in narrowing your request, we will conduct a reasonable search and process your request accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, if you have or later acquire documents relating to your request, please let us know and upload the records into NextRequest.

NOTE: This includes: all but the last four digits of a (1) taxpayer ID number; (2) financial account number; (3) credit/debit card number; (4) driver\u2019s license number; AND (5) all but the year of a person\u2019s date of birth; AND (6) social security number; AND (7) nonelected government employee\u2019s home street address, but not the city state or zip code. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have redacted portion(s) of the records because they are exempt from disclosure under IPRA, NMSA 1978, Section 14-2-1(A) (medical records); Section 14-6-1(A) (medical records); Section 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including NMRA Rule 11-504 (physician-patient and psychotherapist-patient privilege)). See generally 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 160, 164 (HIPAA). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also determined it was necessary and appropriate to redact/blur the officers\u2019 computer screen videos to avoid potential disclosure of information from the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC). See\u00a0NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-2-1.2(A)(7) (confidential sources, methods or information); \u00a7 14-2-1(L) (as otherwise provided by law, including 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.21-21, .33). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsive records:\r\n\r\n* * Lapel Videos - Part 1 (shared via Evidence.com at no charge)\r\n\r\n* Please let us know if the provided videos will satisfy this request or if you still want additional lapel videos. The videos provided should be from the officers most directly involved in the incident, including any who fired their weapons. There are approximately 155 lapel videos related to this request. Reviewing videos to make ready for release takes approximately 2-4 times as long as just watching the video itself, so it is a time-consuming process. If you do want additional lapel videos, if you can narrow your request in any way (such as, to specific officers or events), your request may be fulfilled sooner. Otherwise, it will take a significant amount of time for all the videos to be reviewed and made available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPending records:\r\n\r\n* * Additional Lapel Videos (if requested)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lapel videos responsive to your request were shared with you via Evidence.com; you will receive a link from Evidence.com which will prompt you to create an account in order to view the videos. If you did not receive the link from Evidence.com, please check your junk/spam folder. Please be advised: you cannot share or forward the link from Evidence.com, because this will void the link and you will not be able to access the videos. Additionally, the videos are only active for 90-days, but you may download them at no charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis list reflects my understanding of the records that have been completed and processed and the records on which we are still working.\u00a0If you have a different understanding or believe there are other records outstanding, please contact me as soon as possible.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will be notified when additional records become available. Thank you for your continued patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any issues, please contact the City Clerk's office at (505) 924-3650 for assistance in troubleshooting.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER C.

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll bureau files covering investigations into the Minutemen organization in the following cities: Chicago (105-11643), Los Angeles (62-5101), Miami (105-4921), Phoenix (105-1226), and San Diego (100-12461). The Minutemen were a right-wing paramilitary group founded in June 1960 by businessman Robert Bolivar DePugh and operated in some capacity in cities throughout the United States between 1960 and 1969. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has already made public files on Robert Bolivar DePugh and Minutemen operations in cities like New York City, so I am asking the FBI provide copies of files on these additional cities so the public may have a greater understanding of this organization and its place within the social unrest of the sixties.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media, and I am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I have written for Philly Voice and Atlas Obscura. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $250. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To FOIA Appeals Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information (FOIA) Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am appealing the following:\r\n\r\nOn November 22, 2022, I submitted Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) request number 1510574-000 via MuckRock seeking all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records on the Chicago chapter of paramilitary group the Minutemen. At that time, I included the chapter\u2019s Bureau file number (105-11643) for reference purposes.\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 2022, I received a response letter from the FBI releasing only one page from the chapter\u2019s Bureau file and rejecting the rest of my request. The rejection letter cited FOIA exemptions (b)(3) 50 U.S.C., \u00a7 3024 (i)(1), (b)(6), (b)(7)(c), and (b)(7)(e). I am appealing these exemptions for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n(b)(6) and (b)(7)(c): Exemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(c) are written to protect the rights of individuals against a clear and unwarranted \u201cinvasion of personal privacy,\u201d with (b)(6) specifically covering personnel and medical files. First, I am not requesting personnel or medical files; I am asking for files from investigations into a right-wing paramilitary group. I believe exemption (b)(6) may have been included in error and request a review of this exemption.\r\n\r\nNext, persons and groups may retain privacy rights under some circumstances, but, per the United States Court of Appeals, District Columbia Circuit, in Fund for Constitutional Government v. National Archives & Records Service, these rights yield \u201cwhere exceptional interests militate in favor of disclosure.\u201d Through actions and public statements made by Minuteman founder Robert Bolivar DePugh, the Minutemen and any subsequent chapters have no expectations of privacy because they are figures of exceptional public interest. Mr. DePugh spoke at length with newspapers about the group and participated in an unofficial biography, published in 1968 under the title \"The Minutemen\" (later re-released in 1969 as \"A Private Army\").\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the FBI has already released files on Robert Bolivar DePugh and the Minutemen to researcher John Greenwald, Jr. in 2018, as part of FOIPA request number 1415062-000 (attached under \"1510574-000 Appeal Documents\"). Other files on the New York City chapter were released to researcher Ernie Lazar prior to that (attached under \"1510574-000 Appeal Documents\"). These documents are publicly accessible in a variety of formats as of the writing of this appeal; Mr. Greenwald\u2019s can be found on his site, The Black Vault, while Mr. Lazar\u2019s are collected at the Internet Archive. Privacy concerns cannot be re-extended to figures where they have already been waived or determined no longer applicable.\r\n\r\n(b)(3) 50 U.S.C., \u00a7 3024 (i)(1) and (b)(7)(e): These exemption cover information that disclose \u201cintelligence sources and methods\u201d and \u201ctechniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\" However, these would not apply as the group in question, the Minutemen, ceased operations and disbanded in the 1970s. Although individuals may have claimed to revive the group at various points since then, there are no active chapters of the Minutemen at this time. The group\u2019s founder, Robert Bolivar DePugh, passed away on June 30, 2009 (attached as \"Minuteman outlasted notoriety...\"). In the absence of a functioning body and the death of Mr. DePugh, the release of these files would not risk circumvention of the law by any living parties.\r\n\r\nMany of the intelligence sources for the FBI have also been disclosed elsewhere. These individuals include: Michael Desmond Sadewhite, who served as a Bureau informant from 1966 until 1967 (attached under \"1510574-000 Appeal Documents\"); Henry Edward Warren, who disclosed information on the Minutemen from 1966 to 1968; and Jerry Milton Brooks, who testified against Mr. DePugh in 1966 and later claimed to have worked as an informant for both the FBI and then-Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Unit. These individuals have all been identified publicly in newspaper articles during the 1960s and 1970s or in J. Harry Jones\u2019s book \"The Minutemen\".\r\n\r\nAlso, as previously mentioned, documents containing information about Mr. DePugh and the Minutemen have been released in other FOIPA releases in the past. Any concerns over disclosures with regard to intelligence sources or law enforcement investigation techniques or methods would have been voided upon the release of those documents.\r\n\r\nFinally, I am renewing my request for a fee waiver. I am a member of the news media, with bylines including CovertAction Magazine, Janata Weekly, and Philly Voice. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response to this appeal. I appreciate the work that the FBI's Information Management Division does in processing FOIA requests and disseminating eligible material. As provided in 5 U.S.C. subsection 552(a)(6)(A)(ii), I anticipate that you will produce responsive documents within twenty (20) working days of receipt of this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Seidel, Section Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section, Information Management Division, inquiring if I would like to continue with FOIPA requests 1510698-000 and 1510700-000, for information on the Minutemen organiation. Please consider this communication confirmation of my intention to continue with these requests. No circumstances have changed on my end, and I am still very much interested in obtaining these records.\r\n\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to renew my request for a fee waiver. My bylines include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThank you for your guidance through the FOIPA process. I greatly appreciate the work the FBI's Information Management Division does in reviewing and releasing all eligible records.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

Where non-disclosable portions of public records are \u201creasonably segregable\u201d from the disclosable portions, the agency may withhold or redact the non-disclosable portions while producing the disclosable portions. Thus, redactions are permitted under the CPRA, as long as the basis for the redaction (specified exemption) is identified in the agency\u2019s response. See Cal. Gov. Code \u00a7 7922.525(a)-(b) American Civ. Liberties Union Found\u2019n v.

        "communication": "Andrew Free \nMuckRock News DEPT MR 122335, 411A Highland Ave \nSomerville, Massachusetts 02144-2516 \n\nRE:\tICE FOIA Case Number 2022-ICFO-14106 \n\nDear Requester: \n\nThis letter is the final response to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), dated 12/22/2021.  You have requested all records pertaining to FOIA request 2021-ICFO-32710. This request includes, but is not limited to search taskings, processing notes, and communication regarding the agency\u2019s processing and response.. ICE has considered your request under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. \n\nICE considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and has applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General\u2019s Guidance. \n\nA search of the ICE Office of the Freedom of Information Act for records responsive to your request produced 17 pages that are responsive to your request.  After review of those documents, I have determined portions of 16 pages will be withheld pursuant to Exemptions of the FOIA as described below. \n\nICE has applied FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect from disclosure the names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers of DHS employees, as well as other third-party information contained within the documents. \n\nFOIA Exemption 6 exempts from disclosure personnel or medical files and similar files the release of which would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This requires a balancing of the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to privacy.  The privacy interests of the individuals in the records you have requested outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into the aforementioned balancing test. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  This exemption takes particular note of the strong interests of individuals, whether they are suspects, witnesses, or investigators, in not being unwarrantably associated with alleged criminal activity.  That interest extends to persons who are not only the subjects of the investigation, but those who may have their privacy invaded by having their identities and information about them revealed in connection with an investigation.  Based upon the traditional recognition of strong privacy interest in law enforcement records, categorical withholding of information that identifies third parties in law enforcement records is ordinarily appropriate.  As such, I have determined that the privacy interest in the identities of individuals in the records you have requested clearly outweigh any minimal public interest in disclosure of the information.  Please note that any private interest you may have in that information does not factor into this determination. \n\nICE has applied FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure internal agency case numbers and internal agency URLs contained within the document. \n\nFOIA Exemption 7(E) protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  I have determined that disclosure of certain law enforcement sensitive information contained within the responsive records could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.  Additionally, the techniques and procedures at issue are not well known to the public. \n\nYou have a right to appeal the above withholding determination.  Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.8. You may submit your appeal electronically at GILDFOIAAppeals@ice.dhs.gov or via regular mail to: \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nOffice of the Principal Legal Advisor \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n500 12th Street, S.W., Mail Stop 5900 \nWashington, D.C. 20536-5900 \n\nYour envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d  Copies of the FOIA and DHS regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia. \n\nProvisions of FOIA allow DHS to charge for processing fees, up to $25, unless you seek a waiver of fees.  In this instance, because the cost is below the $25 minimum, there is no charge. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Daniel Edgington at (866) 633-1182 or 500 12th St., SW Stop 5009 Washington, DC 20536-5009.  Additionally, you have a right to right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) which mediates disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  If you are requesting access to your own records (which is considered a Privacy Act request), you should know that OGIS does not have the authority to handle requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974.  You may contact OGIS as follows:  Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448. \n\nSincerely, \n\nMegan Davis \nDeputy FOIA Officer, Operations \n\nEnclosure(s):\t22 Pages \nNote: If you are receiving this message by email and responsive records are not included as an attachment to the email, please log in to your SecureRelease portal account to view the responsive records.\n",

Nino suffered a broken wrist, facial lacerations requiring stitches, and was subsequently hospitalized. He was charged with aggravated assault, though charges were later dropped.\r\nI am requesting copies of all body-worn camera footage from officers who:\r\n\r\nSpoke with Sergio Nino\u2019s father before engaging with the teenager.\r\nInteracted with Sergio Nino, including advising his father on discipline.\r\nUsed force on Nino, leading to his injuries and subsequent arrest.\r\nTransported Nino from the scene to medical facilities or booking.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
