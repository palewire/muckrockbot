Limit the search to a time frame of May 1st 2024 and the date that this request is received. I believe that RCW Ch. 42.56 specifically makes these emails a public record. \r\n\r\nThe public was urged to email Ms. Sodt. More information can be found here:\r\nhttps://friendsofinscape.org/news/historic-seattle-landmarking\r\nhttps://historicseattle.org/ins-building-inscape-landmark-nomination/\r\n\r\nThank you for the city of Seattle's commitment to transparency, and I look forward to working with you on this request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
