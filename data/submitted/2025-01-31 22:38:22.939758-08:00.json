[https://ussliberty.com]\r\n\r\nOn June 8, 2005 the USS Liberty Veterans Association submitted \u201cA Report: War Crimes Committed Against U.S. Military Personnel, June 8, 1967\u201d to the Secretary of the Army in his capacity as Executive Agent for the Secretary of Defense. \r\n\r\nA copy of that report is at https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25497919-war-crimes-report-with-exhibits/.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Defense Law of War Manual requires \u201cDoD policy has required that the commander of any unit that obtains information about a reportable incident shall immediately report the incident through the applicable operational command and Military Department.\u201d [Paragraph 18.13.2, DoD Law of War Manual Page 1100]\r\n\r\nThe footnote on page 1100 states in part, \u201cAll reportable incidents committed by or against U.S. personnel, enemy persons, or any other individual are reported promptly, investigated thoroughly, and, where appropriate, remedied by corrective action.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe DoD Law of War Manual is at https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/DoD%20Law%20of%20War%20Manual%20-%20June%202015%20Updated%20Dec%202016.pdf.\r\n\r\nAn excerpt of the relevant passage in the Law of War Manual is attached.\r\n\r\nA reportable incident committed against U.S. personnel was reported to the Flag and other high-ranking US Navy officers serving on the US Navy Court of Inquiry when USS Liberty survivor Lloyd Painter testified under oath during the US Navy Court of Inquiry that he witnessed the IDF torpedo boats deliberately machine gunning of life rafts we had dropped over the side in anticipation of abandoning ship.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving a copy of the US Navy Court of Inquiry Report, Painter noted that the portion of his testimony referenced above does not appear in the Report of the Court.\r\n\r\nIn his sworn deposition, Painter writes:\r\n\r\n\u201c1515 Hours: I climbed the ladder and opened the hatch to the main deck. I wanted to see if it was safe enough to bring the wounded sailors out onto the main deck. What I saw sent ice running through my veins. The life rafts were either destroyed or had been cut loose and had floated away. I personally observed an Israeli MTB methodically machine gun one of the Liberty's empty life rafts that had been cut loose and was floating in the water. I knew at that split second that the thrust of the IDF attack was to kill every American sailor on board. There were to be no survivors that day. I decided to leave all of the wounded sailors below decks for some measure of protection. I did not prepare to abandon ship.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe have attached a complete copy of Lloyd Painter\u2019s sworn deposition to this request.\r\n\r\nWe are requesting a copy of the investigation of the War Crimes investigation that is mandated by the Department of Defense Manual.\r\n\r\nWe are further requesting a copy of all records related to or mentioning our submission of \u201cA Report: War Crimes Committed Against U.S. Military Personnel, June 8, 1967\u201d\r\n\r\nWE ARE NOT ASKING FOR ANOTHER COPY OF A US NAVY COURT OF INQUIRY REPORT BUT FOR THE REPORT OF THE MANDATED INVESTIGATION, CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOD LAW OF WAR MANUAL, ESTABLISHED TO INVESTIGATE AND RESOLVE THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN OUR WAR CRIMES REPORT WHICH WE SUBMITTED TO THE DOD ON JUNE 8, 2005.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

We charge $50/hour for labor.  Because we do not have the staff to devote such time to one request, we would have to work on this piecemeal. Accordingly, we can begin with the first 5 hours of this project and the cost of this labor will be $250 (made payable in advance of the work being commenced).  If you would like to proceed this way, please send me a check, made payable to the State Attorney's Office, in the amount of $250 and we will get started upon receipt of same.  Due to the various other requests we process daily, completion of this labor should occur within two to three weeks after payment is received.\n",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Carollo: \n\nThe Department of the Navy received your Freedom of Information (FOIA) request dated 1/30/2025 and placed it in queue for processing by order of receipt on the same day. \n\nUnusual circumstances arise when a response within the statutory 20-day period may not be attainable due to: \n\n1. Collection and search for records from a facility outside of this office. \n2. Volume of records that may be responsive to your request. \n3. Consultation with one or more agencies having a substantial interest in the determination or the subject matter. \n\nThe Navy FOIA program is decentralized, requiring our office to search and gather documents from Navy component offices which are not geographically co-located. Per the Department of the Navy FOIA/PA regulation 32 CFR \u00a7701.8(g)(2), this office grants itself an extension of ten days response time. We appreciate your patience and understand the importance of timely responses to FOIA requests and apologize for any inconvenience this delay may cause. \n\nAdditionally, please be aware that the U.S. Navy\u2019s new FOIA portal, Secure Release, is online. For your convenience, you may now submit FOIA requests online at www.SecureRelease.us or www.FOIA.gov. \n\nPlease direct questions to the FOIA Service Center by phone (202) 685-0412 or send via email don-foia-pa@us.navy.mil. \n\nU.S. Navy Headquarters (FOIA) \n2000 Navy Pentagon \nWashington, DC 20350-1200 \ndon-foia-pa@us.navy.mil",
