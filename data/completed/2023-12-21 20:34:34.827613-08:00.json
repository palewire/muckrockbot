        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Daniel Ellsberg. Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny and all records mentioning, relating to, or generated as a result of investigation or inquiry into William David Foreman, also known as David Foreman or Dave Foreman. Mr. Foreman was a prominent environmental activist for over four decades and was co-founder of the organizations Earth First! and the Rewilding Institute as well as the founding publisher of the Earth First Journal.\r\n\r\nMr. Foreman was born on Oct. 18, 1946, in Albuquerque and died on Sept. 19, 2022, in Albuquerque. Specific proof of death is not required as Mr. Foreman\u2019s death has been widely publicized. This is a link to his obituary published in The New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/us/david-foreman-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release. For this request, the term \u201call records\u201d refers to, but is not limited to, any and all documents, correspondence (including, but not limited to, inter and/or intra-agency correspondence as well as correspondence with entities or individuals outside the federal government such as the subject and/or his affiliates, agents, contractors, representatives or lawyers), emails, letters, notes, audio or video recordings, telephone records, voicemails, telephone notes, telephone logs, text messages, chat messages, minutes, memoranda, comments, files, presentations, consultations, assessments, evaluations, schedules, papers published and/or unpublished, reports, studies, photographs and other images, and/or all other responsive records, in draft or final form.  This includes all attachments and/or linked documents noted in the responsive records.\r\n\r\nI also request that fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7552(a)(4)(A)(iii). The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press, and is made in the process of news gathering. The responsive records will also be provided to nonprofit public interest environmental organizations. As the requester, I am a qualified researcher with a nonprofit environmental organization, and will release and share the records in order to inform the public about Mr. Foreman\u2019s work and activities and to contribute to the public\u2019s understanding of the operations and actions of a government agency. This request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that a fee waiver is not granted and there are fees as a result, I would appreciate if you would inform me of the estimated charges to receive the records in advance, if the estimated cost is expected to be more than $25.00.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that any of the responsive records will be exempt from disclosure, as FOIA exemptions must be identified, applied narrowly, and justified by the agency in light of the particular exemption as applied. However, if you determine that responsive records are exempt from disclosure, please separate the exempt portions from the nonexempt portions and release the nonexempt portions. For any records that you determine to be exempt from release, please provide a specific description of the agency record or portion of the record along with a particularized description of the legal basis for withholding it and the FOIA-recognized harm that the agency believes would warrant the withholding. \r\n\r\nI prefer to receive the responsive records electronically, if possible, by electronic download from a website, by attachment to email, or by CD or thumbnail digital storage. If the responsive records are not available electronically, then I request that you mail copies to me using the contact information below.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJennifer Thurston",

The responsive records will also be provided to nonprofit public\r\n    interest environmental organizations. As the requester, I am a qualified\r\n    researcher with a nonprofit environmental organization, and will release and\r\n    share the records in order to inform the public about Mr. Foreman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work and\r\n    activities and to contribute to the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understanding of the operations\r\n    and actions of a government agency. This request is not being made for\r\n    commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that a fee waiver is not granted and there are fees as a\r\n    result, I would appreciate if you would inform me of the estimated charges\r\n    to receive the records in advance, if the estimated cost is expected to be\r\n    more than $25.00.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Please See attachment for description.\r\n\r\nSupporting documentation **\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that efoia@subscriptions.fbi.gov is a no-reply email\r\naddress.

With respect to when the 10 days begins to run, California Code of Civil Procedure section 12 provides that the \u201ctime in which any act provided by law is to be done is computed by excluding the first day and including the last, unless the last day is a holiday, and then it is also excluded.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus, the 10 day period for response to a PRA request would begin the day after receipt of the PRA request.  For example, if an agency received a PRA request on Monday, September 25, the 10 day period would begin on Tuesday, September 26 and expire on Thursday, October 5.\r\n\r\nDo you need more time?\r\n\r\nMolly",

        "communication": "Dear Department Of Correction Records Access Officer:\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n1. All existing monthly, quarterly, and annual reports or other records that indicate the number of people within DOC custody (including DOC pre-release and/or home confinement) who are subject to electronic monitoring (by which we mean GPS or ankle bracelet monitoring, hereinafter referred to as \u201cELMO\u201d) from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. We are interested in records that indicate the average length of time an individual is on ELMO, the reason that an individual is on ELMO and the geographic and demographic (race, ethnicity, age, sex) breakdowns of individuals on ELMO.\r\n2. Records that include information on the operation and implementation of ELMO, including:\r\n  a. Policy manuals or other guidance documents that address, mention, discuss, or implement (by name or in substance)  of 103 DOC 468 \r\n       Electronic Monitoring Program,\r\n  b. Guidance on how violations of ELMO terms/conditions are handled,\r\n  c. Any documents or records that show the impact of ELMO term/condition violations (i.e. whether the individual re-incarcerated, etc),\r\n  d.  Any documents or records that address which staff or unit(s) are responsible for monitoring participants in the DOC ELMO program,\r\n  e.  Any documents, presentations, emails, or other records prepared by the Office of Investigative Services in relation to training staff slated \r\n  to work as a unit responsible for electronic monitoring,\r\n  f.  The cost of ELMO GPS devices to individuals who are on ELMO, if any, and\r\n  g.  Any memorandum of understanding or other records that define the relationship between DOC and Massachusetts Probation Service or \r\n   its ELMO vendors for the provision of people subject to ELMO in DOC custody, pre-release, or home confinement\r\n3. An extract of your records management system that indicates line-level data of the number of individuals on ELMO who are under the DOC\u2019s custody on pre-release, on home confinement, or otherwise from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. Specifically, we request the following fields in an excel or CSV format for all people who were on ELMO at any point at your agency during the above-mentioned time:\r\n  a. The individual\u2019s start date on ELMO\r\n  b. The individual\u2019s end date on ELMO \r\n  c. Reason/status of individual on ELMO (i.e. parole, pre-release, home confinement, etc.)\r\n  d.Reason for individual being released from ELMO, if applicable\r\n  e. County and Zip Code of individual\r\n  f. Age of individual\r\n  g. Gender of individual \r\n  h. Race of individual\r\n  i. Ethnicity of individual \r\n  j. Underlying lead charge and/or offense for which the person was convicted\r\n  k. Whether the person\u2019s GPS conditions were allegedly violated, how many times such an alleged violation occurred, whether the violation was sustained, and what the outcome of said violation was, if applicable. \r\n\r\nThis information does not require identified data or any personally identifying information of any person in the custody of the Department of Correction. This records request seeks only aggregate statistics, or non-identifying database extracts, and documents as outlined above.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the form of production, we note that relevant regulations require the production of records in an accessible, commonly used electronic form, to the extent feasible. See 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). Record custodians are also required to implement new record keeping systems and databases in such a way as to allow for \u201cretrieval of public portions of records to provide maximum public access.\u201d See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(e). Extraction of such data from a database or electronic record system does not constitute creating a new record. See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(f). Printing these records from a database or electronic system, redacting them with a marker, and then re-scanning them, is generally not consistent with these regulations; this process provides the digital records neither in the preferred form nor in a \u201csearchable machine-readable form.\u201d 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). If necessary, we welcome reasonable suggested modifications pursuant to 950 CMR 32.06(2)(g). Per Attorney Gen. v. Dist. Attorney for Plymouth Dist., 484 Mass. 260, 141 N.E.3d 429 (2020), compiling information from a database is not tantamount to creating a new record that would otherwise be precluded under public records law. Specifically: \u201cWhere public records are in electronic form, a public records request that requires a government entity to search its electronic database to extract requested data does not mean that the extracted data constitute the creation of a new record, which would not be required, under the public records law. \" Id. at 442 to 443. Thus, we request that your department query its database and provide a response to the records request.\r\n\r\nShould you determine that some portions of the documents are exempt from disclosure, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are not exempt. In addition, please note for any such redactions the applicable statutory exemption and explain why it applies to the redacted or withheld information.\r\n\r\nI also request that fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by email attachment if available.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nErin Stewart\r\nSchool to Prison Pipeline Project\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

Any documents or records that show the impact of ELMO term/condition violations (i.e. whether the individual re-incarcerated, etc),\nd. Any documents or records that address which staff or unit(s) are responsible for monitoring participants in the DOC ELMO program,\ne.

Any memorandum of understanding or other records that define the relationship between DOC and Massachusetts Probation Service or\nits ELMO vendors for the provision of people subject to ELMO in DOC custody, pre-release, or home confinement\n3. An extract of your records management system that indicates line-level data of the number of individuals on ELMO who are under the DOC\u2019s custody on pre-release, on home confinement, or otherwise from January 1, 2019 to the time when this request is answered. Specifically, we request the following fields in an excel or CSV format for all people who were on ELMO at any point at your agency during the above-mentioned time:\na. The individual\u2019s start date on ELMO\nb. The individual\u2019s end date on ELMO\nc. Reason/status of individual on ELMO (i.e. parole, pre-release, home confinement, etc.)\nd.Reason for individual being released from ELMO, if applicable\ne. County and Zip Code of individual\nf. Age of individual\ng. Gender of individual\nh. Race of individual\ni. Ethnicity of individual\nj. Underlying lead charge and/or offense for which the person was convicted\nk. Whether the person\u2019s GPS conditions were allegedly violated, how many times such an alleged violation occurred, whether the violation was sustained, and what the outcome of said violation was, if applicable.\n\nThis information does not require identified data or any personally identifying information of any person in the custody of the Department of Correction. This records request seeks only aggregate statistics, or non-identifying database extracts, and documents as outlined above.\n\nWith respect to the form of production, we note that relevant regulations require the production of records in an accessible, commonly used electronic form, to the extent feasible. See 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). Record custodians are also required to implement new record keeping systems and databases in such a way as to allow for \u201cretrieval of public portions of records to provide maximum public access.\u201d See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(e). Extraction of such data from a database or electronic record system does not constitute creating a new record. See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(f). Printing these records from a database or electronic system, redacting them with a marker, and then re-scanning them, is generally not consistent with these regulations; this process provides the digital records neither in the preferred form nor in a \u201csearchable machine-readable form.\u201d 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). If necessary, we welcome reasonable suggested modifications pursuant to 950 CMR 32.06(2)(g). Per Attorney Gen. v. Dist. Attorney for Plymouth Dist., 484 Mass. 260, 141 N.E.3d 429 (2020), compiling information from a database is not tantamount to creating a new record that would otherwise be precluded under public records law. Specifically: \u201cWhere public records are in electronic form, a public records request that requires a government entity to search its electronic database to extract requested data does not mean that the extracted data constitute the creation of a new record, which would not be required, under the public records law. \" Id. at 442 to 443. Thus, we request that your department query its database and provide a response to the records request.\n\nShould you determine that some portions of the documents are exempt from disclosure, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are not exempt. In addition, please note for any such redactions the applicable statutory exemption and explain why it applies to the redacted or withheld information.\n\nI also request that fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by email attachment if available.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoshua Dankoff\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\nErin Stewart\nSchool to Prison Pipeline Project\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice \nYour request will be forwarded to the relevant department(s) to locate the information you seek and to determine the volume and any costs associated with satisfying your request. You will be contacted about the availability and/or provided with copies of the records in question. \n \nYou can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you'll receive an email when your request has been completed.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Manuel de Dios Unanue (4 January 1943 \u2013 11\r\n    March 1992) who was a Cuban-born US journalist, radio show host, anti-drug\r\n    crusading editor of magazines Cambio XXI and Crimen, and editor-in-chief of\r\n    El Diario La Prensa, New York City's largest Spanish-language daily\r\n    newspaper.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 853 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,786 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,500 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

It is very difficult to provide an accurate estimated date of completion until our FOIA analyst reviews these records for responsiveness and we have a better sense of the number of pages and the sensitivity of the material. Our general expectation is that we will be able to send you a final response within 3-4 months.\r\n\r\nPlease know that this estimate may change dramatically based on the volume of work associated with our expedited COVID-19 requests that are in front of the queue and on the types of records we received from the Program office regarding your request.\r\nRegardless of the specificity of your request, we cannot accurately estimate the amount of time it will take to process the record until we understand both the volume and sensitivity of the records.\r\nWe hope that this response provides additional insight into why we are not able to give you a more precise estimated date of completion, and why we expect it will take 3-4 months for us to respond to your request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records.

PRU responds as follows:\r\n\r\nRequest No. 1\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease provide the following information: Lists all technologies including the names of all products, manufacturers and model numbers for artificial intelligences, algorithms, databases, database locations, data analytic centers, softwares, facial recognition technologies, predictive policing programs, hot spot mapping systems, mobile applications, automated license plate readers, cameras; body worn or otherwise, audio and video recording equipment, stingrays, digital receiver technologies, reports, (including but not limited to police reports/citation numbers), financial documents, field interviews cards\r\nused in securing Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 201.354 citations/arrests for the time period 1/1/2022 through November 30, 2023.\u201d\r\n\r\nResponse to Request No. 1\r\n\r\nAs discussed during our phone conversation on December 12, 2023, LVMPD does not track the technologies used to facilitate arrests. In order to determine if technologies, products, databases, etc. were used, each individual arrest report would have to be reviewed. Therefore, this portion of your request is burdensome.\r\n\r\nThe records you seek are not readily available and would be unduly burdensome to gather, compile, redact, and produce.\r\nA public entity need not produce records that are not readily available and would require research, compilation, and redaction to produce.  See Lunney v. State, 418 P.3d 943, 954 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2017) (recognizing that the agency was not required to respond to the burdensome request); Shehadeh v. Madigan, 996 N.E.2d 1243, 1249 (Ill. App. Ct. 2013) (holding that the Attorney General satisfied its burden by explaining that its staff members would have to go through all of the 9,200 potentially responsive documents by hand); Beckett v. Serpas, 112 So.3d 348, 353 (La. App. Ct. 2013) (determining that segregating 10-years\u2019 worth of files is unreasonably burdensome); Community Youth Athletic Ctr. v. City of Nat\u2019l City, 164 Cal.Rptr.3d 644, 676, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1425 (2013) (generally, an agency is not required to undertake extraordinarily extensive or intrusive searches, and in general, the scope of an agency\u2019s search for public records need only be reasonably calculated to locate responsive documents) .\r\nTo determine if producing documents \u201cposes an unreasonable administrative burden,\u201d courts consider whether the general presumption in favor of disclosure is overcome by:  \u201c(1) the resources and time it will take to locate, compile, and redact the requested materials; (2) the volume of materials requested; and, (3) the extent to which compliance with the request will disrupt the agency's ability to perform its core functions.\u201d  Lunney, 418 P.3d at 954; cf.\r\n\r\nNAC 239.860 (defining \u201creadily available\u201d for purposes of State agencies as records that are \u201ceasily retrievable,\u201d \u201cnot confidential,\u201d and having a \u201cnature...such that an officer, employee or agent of the agency\u2026is not required to review the record to determine whether the record includes confidential information\u201d).\r\nPlease reformulate your request.  If you can narrow your focus to records that are readily available, LVMPD can proceed with researching your request.\r\n\r\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) does not maintain any particular record containing the information you are seeking. Moreover, LVMPD databases cannot \u201creadily compile the requested information.\u201d  See Public Employees Retirement System of Nevada v. Nevada Policy Research Inst., Inc., --- Nev. ---, 429 P.3d 280, 288 (2018), quoting Las Vegas Metro. Police Dep\u2019t v. Blackjack Bonding, Inc., 131 Nev. 80, 87, 343 P.3d 608, 613 (2015).\r\nIn other words, your request requires LVMPD to do more than simply \u201c[s]earch[] an electronic database to produce existing records and data\u2026.\u201d\r\n\r\nPublic Employees Retirement System at 287, quoting ACLU of Arizona v. Arizona Dep\u2019t of Child Safety, 377 P.3d 339, 346 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2016).  Rather, your request requires LVMPD to \u201ccompile information about the information [the database] contains.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).\r\nAs such, your request requires the creation of a new record, which LVMPD has no duty to do under the Nevada Public Records Act.  Public Employees Retirement System at 286.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequest No. 2\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease provide all citation/arrest numbers for Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 201.354 and Nevada Revised Statute \u00a7 201.353 (To include all Sub Sections) for the time of January 01, 2022 through November 30, 2023.\u201d\r\n\r\nResponse to Request No. 2\r\n\r\nWe are actively corresponding with the appropriate unit(s) to determine what documents, if any, are responsive.\r\n\r\n Please be advised The Nevada Public Records Act permits public entities to \u201ccharge a fee for providing a copy of a public record\u201d as long as the fee does \u201cnot exceed the actual cost to the government entity to provide the copy of the public record.\u201d NRS 239.052(1). \u201cActual cost\u201d is defined broadly as \u201cthe direct cost related to the reproduction incurred by a governmental entity in the provision of a public records, including without limitation, the cost of ink, toner, paper, media and postage.\u201d NRS 239.005(1). The latter statute was amended in 2019 by the Nevada Legislature via Senate Bill 287. The legislative history indicates that public entities may charge for labor and personnel costs when compilation and redaction are required.\r\n\r\nWe will advise if there will be a fee after corresponding with the appropriate unit.\r\n You can expect to be updated on the progress of your request no later than 01/02/2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPublic Records Unit (PRU)\r\nLas Vegas Metropolitan Police Department",

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

I am specifically seeking records related to the discovery of two deceased women in the home in March 2016. The types of records I am interested in include: complaints, site investigations, notices of violation (NOVs), return to compliance documentation, and those related to the suspension of the home's license (motions, complaints, summary judgments, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKent Hoover, a citizen of Tennessee, in coordination with Caitlin Downey.",

My paralegal has estimated that it will take 3 hours to fulfill your request.\r\nFor purposes of the cost incurred, the first hour is free, so in actuality it will only be the charge for two hours of the paralegal's time at $34.74 per hour for a total cost of $69.48.\r\n\r\nWhile that figure is just an estimate (it may be slightly higher or lower than the estimated figure), the estimation is usually fairly accurate.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to proceed with your public records request given the amount of the estimation, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DA2901.D4840960]\r\nTroy Bryant | Associate General Counsel, Regulatory Boards Division\r\nOffice of Legal Counsel\r\nDavy Crockett Tower, 12th Floor\r\n500 James Robertson Pkwy, Nashville, TN 37243\r\n615-770-0447\r\nTroy.Bryant@tn.gov<mailto:Troy.Bryant@tn.gov>\r\ntn.gov/commerce<http://www.tn.gov/commerce>\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MISSION: To provide exceptional legal service and valuable counsel to achieve the mission of our clients and serve the people of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n_____________NOTICE______________\r\nThis e-mail message and any attachment is for use by the recipient only, and contain information that may be legally privileged and confidential from the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, Legal Division.

Through the survey, superintendents are required to attest that the district is teaching about the Holocaust appropriately as part of classroom instruction aligned with the NYS Social Studies Learning Standards and \u00a7801 of Education Law.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, Deputy Commissioner Angelique Johnson-Dingle sent a memo to public school superintendents including a copy of that survey and instructions for accessing and submitting the survey via the SED Monitoring and Vendor Performance System in the NYSED Business Portal.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request all of the Holocaust Instruction Survey responses submitted since August 10, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

        "communication": "CDR U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command\r\nAttn: Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts Office\r\n810 Schreider Street\r\nFort Detrick, MD 21702-5000\r\n\r\nAugust 23, 2023\r\n\r\nGreetings:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am appealing the following decision for FOIA case number FA-23-0032/FP-23-0018994:\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 2023, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request was filed via MuckRock with the U.S. Army Medical Department asking for copies of records germane to award ID W81XWH2211105.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 2023, Glenn W. Field, Records Manager, U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence, responded by stating this request had been forwarded to the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USMRAA). A subsequent communication from Nicole Schwab, Freedom of Information Act Specialist, USMRAA, also dated June 6, 2023, confirmed receipt of the request and stated it had been assigned a FOIA control number of 23-00415.\r\n\r\nOn June 7, 2023, Nicole Schwab, Freedom of Information Act Specialist, USMRAA, released a copy of a program announcement for the Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health Research Program, and on June 23, 2023, released a copy of a grant voucher for the program.\r\n\r\nFinally, on June 12, 2023, Robyn Mack, Communications Director, U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC), responded to a partial referral to the USAMRDC, now assigned a FOIA case number FA-23-0032/FP-23-0018994, notifying me that it had been rejected because the reviewing agency could find no records.\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\n\r\nIn my original FOIA request, I referenced a Politico article dated September 15, 2022, titled \"The Pentagon is funding experiments on animals to recreate \u2018Havana Syndrome\u2019\". You will find a copy of this article attached but for clarity's sake, a link can be found here: https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/09/pentagon-funding-experiments-animals-havana-syndrome-00086393\r\n\r\nThe Politico article identifies award ID W81XWH2211105 as being connected to Department of Defense-funded research that will use live animal subjects in testing and experimentation. The relevant sections of the article state: \r\n\r\n\"The Army in September awarded Wayne State University in Michigan a $750,000 grant to study the effects of radio frequency waves on ferrets, which have brains similar to humans, according to information on the grant posted on USASpending.gov.\r\n\r\n\"During the Wayne University study, researchers planned to expose the 48 ferrets to radio frequency waves for two hours a day for 60 days. This is expected to result in 'an exposure profile that is likely comparable to that which our embassy personnel received.' Twenty-four additional ferrets will receive 'sham exposure,' according to the summary.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to use an animal like a ferret that has brain structures resembling the 'gyrencephalic nature' of the human brain; mice and rats do not fulfill this criteria, according to the summary. The brain tissue of gyrencephalic animals, like humans, ferrets, pigs and primates, resembles ridges and valleys, compared to smooth surfaces of the brains of lissencephalic animals, such as mice and rats.\"\r\n\r\nGiven that these highlighted sections reference tests using live animals, I believe the USAMRDC did not conduct a complete search of records. Had it done so it should have also found, at a minimum, a proposal created by Wayne State researchers and sent to the USAMRDC\u2019s Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO), an ACURO-formatted appendix, an institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) approved protocol, and, potentially, adverse event reports.\r\n\r\nPer the USAMRDC ACURO website, these documents are required for all research funded by the Department of Defense. For instance, a section of the website covering protocol submission instructions (https://mrdc.health.mil/index.cfm/collaborate/research_protections/acuro/protocol_submission) states: \r\n\r\n\u201cInstitutions using United States Department of Defense (DoD) funds to support the use of animals in research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) or training must adhere to DoD requirements for administrative review and approval by the Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO). Below is guidance on protocol and amendment submission.\u201d\r\n\r\nAPPEAL\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am appealing the June 12, 2023 decision by Ms. Mack and, at a minimum, requesting copies of the following records:\r\n\r\n- ACURO proposal;\r\n\r\n- ACURO appendix;\r\n\r\n- IACUC approved protocol;\r\n\r\n- Adverse Event Reports.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am also asking the USAMRDC to conduct an additional search for other records germane to award ID W81XWH2211105. It is likely that if the USAMRDC missed these records, it may have also missed others.\r\n\r\nI am also renewing my request for a fee waiver. The waiver would help to further public understanding of government-funded research currently underway on the subject of anomalous health incidents, aka Havana Syndrome. This subject has appeared in numerous articles since 2017 such as the one published by Politico on September 15, 2022, making it both a subject of public interest and one that would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response to this appeal. I appreciate the work that the USMRAA and USAMRDC do in processing FOIA requests and disseminating eligible material. As provided in 5 U.S.C. subsection 552(a)(6)(A)(ii), I anticipate that you will produce responsive documents within twenty (20) working days of receipt of this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Mr. Skvarla,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe have received your appeal to a FOIA request with tracking number\r\nFA-23-0032. We received it on 6 October 2023, and it was post marked 5\r\nSeptember 2023.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour original request was for the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for award ID W81XWH2211105, granted to Wayne State\r\nUniversity for a\r\n\r\n\"TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH RESEARCH\r\n\r\nPROGRAM\", first referenced in a story published by Politico on March 9,\r\n2023, titled \"The\r\n\r\nPentagon is funding experiments on animals to recreate 'Havana Syndrome'\".\r\nWayne State\r\n\r\nUniversity was awarded the grant on September 15, 2022 through the\r\nDepartment of Defense's\r\n\r\nDefense Health Program, and is collaborating with researchers at the\r\nUniversity of Michigan\r\n\r\non the project. This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Grant Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by Wayne State University and the Department of Defense\r\nconnected to this\r\n\r\nGrant\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour request came to us by way of a referral from MEDCoe to USAMRAA to my\r\noffice at USAMRDC. Only a portion of the request was sent to our office for\r\ndirect response to you as the requester. That portion was specifically in\r\nreference to \"Presentations by Wayne State University and the Department of\r\nDefense connected to this Grant.\" (see Partial Referral Memo From USAMRAA -\r\nattached)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur response of \"No Records\" was solely to that portion of the request. This\r\nwas outlined in our response letter dated 12 June 2023 and sent to you on 27\r\nJune 2023. USAMRAA maintained the remainder of the request since they have\r\npurview of records for awards. We were only responsible to respond to the\r\nportion related to \"Presentations by Wayne State University and the\r\nDepartment of Defense connected to this Grant\". (see FA-23-0032 (Skvarla)\r\nResponse No Records - attached)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, your original request was for \"copies of records for award ID\r\nW81XWH2211105\". Your appeal is requesting additional records (i.e. ACURO and\r\nIACUC records) that would not be considered records of a contract award and\r\nwould therefore not be considered within the scope of your original request.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConsidering the above information, we have made the following\r\ndeterminations:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.\tYour appeal does not refer to any adverse determinations provided by\r\nour response letter referencing the portion of the request that we were\r\nresponsible to reply to.\r\n\r\n*\tIt does not appear you have appealed our decision making your appeal\r\nunactionable from our office.\r\n\r\n2.\tYou will need to submit a new FOIA request for any additional\r\nrecords from USAMRDC. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere may be a misunderstanding of the terminology used and how it is\r\ninterpreted within your description of records. If you would like to give me\r\na call at the number in my signature block, I'd be more than happy to assist\r\nin getting a request together for exactly what you are seeking. Also, I do\r\nnot believe you have received a final response from USAMRAA on the remainder\r\nof your request. They could possibly have more records.\r\n\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you,\r\n\r\nCarl\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCarl Larcom\r\n\r\nFOIA/Privacy Officer\r\n\r\nU.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command\r\n\r\n810 Schreider St.\r\n\r\nSuite 206\r\n\r\nFort Detrick, MD  21702\r\n\r\n301-619-6852\r\n\r\n <mailto:usarmy.detrick.medcom-usamrmc.mbx.foia@health.mil>\r\nusarmy.detrick.medcom-usamrmc.mbx.foia@health.mil",

        "communication": "Mr. Stecklow,\r\n\r\nThis email is in response to your FOIA request that was received by the District of Columbia Housing Authority (\u201cDCHA\u201d) for the documents as specified in your FOIA request below.\r\n\r\nUnder the District of Columbia Freedom of Information Act, D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-532 (2001) (\u201cDC FOIA\u201d), DCHA must make a reasonable effort to locate already existing records. FOIA does not require DCHA to conduct research for requesters, answer written questions, or in any other way create records (such as lists or statistics) to respond to a request. As such, DCHA can only provide requesters with existing documents or records maintained by the agency.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with DC FOIA, DCHA thoroughly searched the applicable agency records and found responsive documents, which are located here: Production<https://dchousing.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/ogcTeam/EuJHrjdYrBhPgS6a3pGgrHAB72Kv-Y_x7gTGsyRJ9V9Jlw?email=154470-01554957%40requests.muckrock.com&e=76DMg5>\r\n\r\nRegarding any redaction of personal information or withholding of documents, such information or documents may be withheld pursuant to DC Code \u00a72-534(a)(2) to prevent an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this response a denial of your request, you are advised that under D.C. Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR 412, you have the right to appeal to the Mayor or the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nIf you elect to appeal to the Mayor, the appeal must be in writing. The appeal letter should cite the \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal\" or \"FOIA Appeal\" in the subject line. If you mail the appeal, this should also be on the outside of the envelope. The appeal must include the following:\r\n\r\n1.            Copy of the original request.\r\n\r\n2.            Copy of your appeal letter.\r\n\r\n3.            Statement of appeal that includes the circumstances, reasons, or arguments advanced in support of disclosure.\r\n\r\n4.            Daytime telephone number, an e-mail address, or a USPS mailing address.\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be mailed to:\r\n\r\nMayor\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel\r\nFOIA Appeal\r\n1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW\r\nSuite 407\r\nWashington, D.C. 20004\r\n\r\nIn lieu of mailing the appeal via USPS, an electronic version of the appeal can be e-mailed to the Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel instead at foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov>. The electronic version must still meet all of the requirements for an appeal.\r\n\r\nA copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to DCHA\u2019s attention at foia@dchousing.org<mailto:foia@dchousing.org>.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact DCHA if you have any additional questions.\r\n\r\nEric D.
