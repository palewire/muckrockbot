        "communication": "Dear Susan Dyer Reynolds,\r\n\r\nWe understand that you are following up on a records request that was sent from \u201cBelle Reve\u201d from the muckrock email address above.  The Office of the Mayor responded to this request on September 4 and September 18.  See attached file entitled \u201cRe_Sunshine Great Highway.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn our response of September 18, we provided five records responsive to the original request.  Two of those records contained redactions.  We set forth the bases of those redactions in the body of our response.  We understand that your Immediate Disclosure Request, sent Sunday and therefore deemed received today, seeks unredacted versions of those two records.\r\n\r\nThe redacted versions of those files are linked in the attached.  We cannot provide unredacted versions.  As we clearly explained in our September 18 email, \u201cthe record entitled \u201cRe_MEDIA Alert \u2026\u201d has been redacted to protect personal contact information.  See California Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 1; Cal. Gov. Code 7927.700.\u201d  As shown in that file, we redacted the personal email contact information of a member of the public to protect their privacy.  Those redactions were identified, along with the statutory citations to justify them, in the body of our September 18 email.\r\n\r\nWe also clearly explained that \u201c[t]he record entitled \u201cRE_Draft Great Highway \u2026\u201d has been redacted pursuant to the attorney/client privilege.  See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 7927.705; Cal. Evid. Code \u00a7 954; S.F. Admin. Code \u00a7 67.21(k).\u201d  All of the redactions in that file were made because all of the redacted portions are communications made for purposes of soliciting or receiving legal advice and are therefore protected from disclosure pursuant to the attorney/client privilege.  The statutory citations to justify these redactions are also clearly provided in the body of our September 18 email.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Mayor\u2019s Office satisfied our obligations under SFSO 67.27 by clearly identifying and justifying the redactions in these files with citations to specific statutory authority.  We also provided a clear reference to the justifications for the withholdings in each document, as we provided statements for each document explaining the redactions in those documents, as required by SFSO 67.26.  We also kept withholding to a minimum; only the portions of the \u201cRe_MEDIA Alert\u201d document with personal contact information and the portions of the \u201cRe_Draft Great Highway\u201d document containing attorney/client privileged communications were withheld.  See SFSO 67.26.  No additional redactions were made.\r\n\r\nThus, we have provided you with responsive records and properly justified the redactions in those records.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have located additional records responsive to your request.  See them attached here.  Note that the record entitled \u201c00. Notes -  Great Highway Parade 6.29.24_Redacted\u201d contains redactions of certain phone numbers which have been withheld to protect personal privacy and because they constitute official information subject to the official information privilege.  See California Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 1; Cal. Gov. Code 7927.700; Cal. Evid. Code 1040.\r\n\r\nWe have not withheld any records in their entirety in response to your request.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nHank Heckel\r\nLegal Compliance Officer\r\nOffice of the Mayor\r\nCity and County of San Francisco",

However, such requests are reserved for requests that are \u201csimple, routine and readily answerable.\u201d See San Francisco Administrative Code Section 67.25(a).  Your request seeks communications between anyone in the Mayor\u2019s Office and five different individuals with no subject matter limitation over an unlimited period of time.  Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for an immediate disclosure request and is being processed as a regular request.\r\n\r\nWe have invoked a 14 day extension from the original due date due to the need to consult with another City department.  See Cal. Gov. Code 7922.535(a) and S.F. Admin. Code \u00a7 67.25(b).

You requested the following: \r\nTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nRecords sufficient to show copies of Parent Restriction letters issued from July 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024 for the following schools/instances: \r\n\r\n1. Any district-wide issued letters; \r\n2. Any letters issued by schools in Network Three: \r\nBelmont-Cragin \r\nBrunson \r\nBurbank \r\nDepriest \r\nEllington \r\nFalconer \r\nHanson Park \r\nHay \r\nHowe \r\nLeland \r\nLewis \r\nLloyd \r\nLocke J \r\nLovett \r\nLyon \r\nMcNair \r\nNash \r\nNorthwest \r\nPrieto \r\nSayre \r\nSchubert \r\nSpencer \r\nYoung ES \r\n\r\nThese may also be listed as \"Violation of Visitor Protocol\" letters. Please note that I am not seeking any personally identifiable information or otherwise exempt information. As required by the statute, please ensure that the requested documents are redacted rather than exempting the entirety of the document. Additionally, for any and all exemptions used to redact exempt information, please provide clear and convincing evidence for each exemption used by your agency. \r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of The FOIA Bakery. Because this request is in the public interest for Illinois nonprofit The FOIA Bakery\u2019s work to advocate for public education, please waive any fees in accordance with 5 ILCS \u00a7 140/6(c). Feel free to contact me with any questions, or if clarification is needed. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nMiriam Bhimani \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fchicago-public-schools-3121%252Fn3-parent-restriction-letters-173741%252F%253F&url_auth_token=AAATZ164Jy60iQjs6iHTUOyYGcc%3A1stHhg%3AK4CHYgV6QWai9TuVZZ_S8IJkBeYpPgPbcZPMd3O6q5A \r\nRESPONSE: The CPS FOIA Office has reviewed your request and has determined the following: In response to number 1 of your request, the FOIA Office has conducted a due diligence search for records responsive to your request and has determined that no records responsive to your request were located. \r\nIn response to number 2 of your request, the letters that the FOIA Office was able to locate are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPlease be advised that certain student and parent/guardian information was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). \r\nSection 7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter.\r\n4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024.\r\n\r\nThis request is expressly limited to Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency's own FOIA office. Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information.\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction.\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes;\r\n* these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and\r\n* these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to provide:\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number\r\n* 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\n\r\nP.S.

        "communication": "Dear Department of Homeland Security,\r\n\r\nIn official capacity on behalf of Fiat Fiendum only, not in personal capacity, I hereby request the following records under 5 USC 552(a)(3):\r\n\r\n1. all records previously released under 5 USC 552(a)(3) by your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency,  corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1)\r\n\r\n2. all records of each request that resulted in any of those prior record releases, including all communications to and from the requester, records of searches conducted, and discussion of the request\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I request:\r\na. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\")\r\nb. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors; IDs; revision numbers; email headers; hyperlinks; structural metadata; email addresses; comments; revision history; timestamps; file names and contents; pagination or lack thereof; format specific metadata (e.g. particular to Word, PDF, or paper files); filing location, labeling, & organization; etc.\r\nc. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\nMy request is literally for all records you have previously released under FOIA, and for the associated records about the requests under which they were previously released.\r\n\r\nA major objective of this request is to get you to publish all released FOIA records, and all records about requests resulting in those releases, to your electronic FOIA \"reading room\", pursuant to 5 USC 552(a)(2)(D). There is therefore one exclusion: this request does not cover records that are already publicly available on your electronic FOIA reading room.\r\n\r\nOther than that, this request has no time or subject limit whatsoever, other than that the cutoff date is the date of your search.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Form & format\r\n\r\n## Native email format & minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease provide all email records in EML, Maildir, or MBOX format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization).\r\n\r\nPlease provide all other records in their original electronic format (if electronic), and as one 300dpi color scan PDF per logical document, staple, paperclip, or file folder (whichever is most narrow) if the original is in paper format.\r\n\r\nPlease note that FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information, along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption, and without altering any non exempt information (including metadata).\r\n\r\n## No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records.\r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, and\r\n2. all proprietary software and documentation necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n## Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nI am partially blind. In accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and the FOIA Improvement Act, I require that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nPlease make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password). Do not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload. If that is insufficient, I can also provide Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, rsync, or similar provisions that will let you easily upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to me for free.\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, and Chris, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7) or (b)(6)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(D) - confidential source 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 2\", each instance of \"Chris\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - US congressional aide 3\",  etc. This would vindicate your narrow interest in withholding the person's identity, while not withholding the facts of commonality between occurrences, nor the relevant natures of each redacted person, which you would not have justification to withhold.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Alice's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"Alice's cell #\" (or \"confidential source 1's cell #\" if her name is redacted, as above). \r\n\r\nFor PDFs, this can be specified in the margins if the identifier does not fit in the original space. For more native electronic files, like EML, this can be done by direct editing. If space or file format does not permit you to do so inline or in margins or equivalent, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full replacement identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere, or the kind of thing redacted. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rolling updates\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with rolling (incremental) updates, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\nPlease preserve all responsive records that you currently hold, pending release, particularly ones that are currently held in electronic form or format.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize rolling updates based on what is most readily available, i.e. such that you release as the greatest amount of records in the fastest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fee waiver\r\n\r\nI request fee waiver, because\r\n* Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit;\r\n* this request is for public interest, non-commercial, journalistic purposes;\r\n* by definition, you have already found and disclosed the records for item 1, and your FOIA office itself holds all or nearly all the records for item 2;\r\n* I am requesting records to be provided exclusively in electronic format, with no paper copies, so you should incur no actual costs; and\r\n* by definition, FOIA releases are of public interest, this is exclusively about prior public releases, and making them more widely available advances the goals of the Act.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, please bear in mind the statutory obligation under 5 USC 552(a)(2)(D)(ii)(II) to post records to your electronic reading room if they have been \"requested\" 3 or more times, and released at least once under 552(a)(3).\r\n\r\nBy definition, all records responsive to item 1 of my request have been requested at least one previous time, and were released at least once under 552(a)(3). This request is at least one more \"request\" (and that clause is not conditioned on having achieved a release). There may well have been another prior \"request\". If there was, this request is at least the third, and therefore triggers the mandatory publication requirement. If not, I would nevertheless urge you to exercise your discretion to release them publicly.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your initial response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nP.S.

Our office received your request on 10/28/2024.  Specifically, you requested: \r\n1. all records previously released under 5 USC 552(a)(3) by your Department, including every component or otherwise associated agency, corporation, or other establishment of the executive branch within the meaning of 5 USC 552(f)(1) \r\n\r\n2. all records of each request that resulted in any of those prior record releases, including all communications to and from the requester, records of searches conducted, and discussion of the request \r\n\r\nDue to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request.  Consistent with 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, the Department processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.  Although DHS\u2019 goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period in certain circumstances under 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(c). \r\n\r\nYou have requested a fee waiver.  The DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.11(k) set forth six factors DHS must evaluate to determine whether the applicable legal standard for a fee waiver has been met:  (1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns \u201cthe operations or activities of the government,\u201d (2) Whether the disclosure is \u201clikely to contribute\u201d to an understanding of government operations or activities, (3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester or a narrow segment of interested persons, (4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of government operations or activities will be \u201csignificant,\u201d (5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure, and (6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requester is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. \r\n\r\nUpon review of the subject matter of your request, and an evaluation of the six factors identified above, DHS has determined that it will conditionally grant your request for a fee waiver.  The fee waiver determination will be based upon a sampling of the responsive documents received from the various DHS program offices as a result of the searches conducted in response to your FOIA request.  DHS will, pursuant to DHS FOIA regulations applicable to non-commercial requesters, provide two hours of search time and process the first 100 pages at no charge to you.  If upon review of these documents, DHS determines that the disclosure of the information contained in those documents does not meet the factors permitting DHS to waive the fees, then DHS will at that time either deny your request for a fee waiver entirely, or will allow for a percentage reduction in the amount of the fees corresponding to the amount of relevant material found that meets the factors allowing for a fee waiver.  In either case, DHS will promptly notify you of its final decision regarding your request for a fee waiver and provide you with the responsive records as required by applicable law. \r\n\r\nIn the event that your fee waiver is denied, and you determine that you still want the records, provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations as they apply to non-commercial requesters.  As a non-commercial requester you will be charged for any search time and duplication beyond the free two hours and 100 pages mentioned in the previous paragraph.  You will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication and search time at the per quarter-hour rate ($4.00 for clerical personnel, $7.00 for professional personnel, $10.25 for managerial personnel) of the searcher.  In the event that your fee waiver is denied, we will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00.  This office will contact you before accruing any additional fees. \r\n\r\nWe have queried the appropriate component(s) of DHS for responsive records.  If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability.  Please be assured that one of the analysts in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible.  We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request. \r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2025-HQFO-00669.  Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence. If you have any questions, or would like to discuss this matter, please feel free to contact this office at 1-866-431-0486 or 202-343-1743.",

The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email inbox or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. 2. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's email spam folder or equivalent which was received nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. 3. The one email in your chief FOIA officer's sent email folder or equivalent which was sent nearest and before October 19, 2024, midnight Eastern time, regardless of subject matter. 4. The total full-time equivalent count of people who work for your FOIA office as of October 19, 2024. This request is expressly limited to Amtrak's own FOIA office. Please do not refer it to any other agency or division. This request is expressly not a Privacy Act request, and no PA waiver will be provided. Please provide the email records in EML, Maildir, MBOX, MIX, MSG, or PST format only \u2014 not PDF, Word, image, etc \u2014 including all metadata (e.g. full email headers as received/sent) and attachments, without alteration other than narrowly tailored electronic redaction of specifically claimed exemptions that do not affect any part of non exempt information (and, in particular, without rasterization). Please provide the fourth record as a statement in your response letter, or at your option, as the most readily available record, in original electronic format as currently stored on your computer systems, which includes that information. Please provide all records either as individual files, or as an unencrypted ZIP file, uploaded to MuckRock. Do not apply any encryption, DRM, or other restriction. I request fee waiver, because * Fiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit; * this request is for public interest, non-commercial purposes; * these records would give a snapshot of insight into the everyday processes of FOIA offices; and * these records are being requested in order to conduct a government-wide audit of agencies' FOIA compliance. In the event that you deny fee waiver, please process this request as-is, because I will not agree to any fees. Please be sure to provide: * 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(II) FOIA Public Liaison information * 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(aa) appeal information * 5 USC 552(a)(6)(A)(i)(III)(bb) OGIS information * 5 USC 552(a)(7)(A) tracking number * 5 USC 552(a)(7)(B)(ii) completion ETA Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires. Sincerely, Sai President, Fiat Fiendum, Inc. P.S. Sai is my full legal name.. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis request has been issued tracking number 25-FOI-00027.  Please reference this number in all correspondence and communications with this office. \r\n\r\nItem 2 (spam) is attached.\r\n\r\nItems 1 and 3 are being withheld under FOIA Exemption 5, Attorney-Client Priviliege.  \r\n\r\nExemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act protects \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\" Courts have construed this somewhat opaque language to \"exempt those documents, and only those documents that are normally privileged in the civil discovery context.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to Amtrak\u2019s FOIA regulations (49 CFR 701.10), if you do not agree with Amtrak\u2019s decision, you may file an appeal with Byl Herrmann, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Assistant Corporate Secretary, within ninety days (90) of the date of this letter, specifying the relevant facts and the basis for your appeal.  Your appeal may be mailed to Mr. Herrmann\u2019s attention:  National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Law Department, One Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC  20001.  The President and CEO of Amtrak has delegated authority to the General Counsel and Assistant Corporate Secretary for the rules and compliance to the FOIA.   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nFOIA Officer\"",

I appeal your refusal of my form and format request as to item 2, and your constructive denial of item 4.\r\n\r\nAs for item 2, you stated that you were providing the email in full, and sent it as a PDF (within a zip file). By exporting it to PDF, you disregarded my electronic form & format requests \u2014 and you additionally rasterized the record, which I specifically asked you not to do. OCR does not cure the destruction of the original structural metadata that makes it accessible, nor make available the parts of the records (such as hyperlinks, headers, etc) which were destroyed by rasterization. I did not consent to you making new, worse records in this way.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the email in one of the native electronic email formats listed; any email software will save to them easily.\r\n\r\nMy form and format request is mandatory under 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) & (f)(2)(A) (E-FOIA & FOIA Improvement Act) and 29 USC 794d (Rehab Act \u00a7 508).\r\n\r\nAs for item 4, you simply did not respond at all. I therefore appeal your constructive denial for lack of any basis.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

        "communication": "Dear \"PRA Audit\" Requester,\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.520, this letter is to acknowledge receipt of the public records request you submitted to the Central Kitsap School District (\"District\") on November 7, 2021, via the District's electronic public records request form. Specifically, you requested the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Central Kitsap School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nYou also requested that these records be provided to you in native electronic format. The District interprets that to mean that you would like the native format of the records as they were provided to each requester. Please let us know as soon as possible if this is not a correct interpretation of your request for records in native format. Please also be aware that in some instances it may not be possible to provide records in native format if additional redactions must be made to the records before they are provided to you.\r\n\r\nFurther, the records retention period for public records requests is two years, so the District does not have copies of all requests and responses dating back to January 1, 2010. However, the District will be sure to provide you with all responsive records currently in our possession.\r\n\r\nBecause of the broad nature of your request, please understand that it will take the District a significant amount of time to fill the request. If you would like to narrow the scope of your request so that we may provide you with the records you are seeking in a more expeditious manner, you are always welcome to do so.\r\n\r\nThe District currently estimates it will be able to provide you with all records responsive to this request by March 31, 2022, with an estimated date of December 17, 2021, for an initial installment of records. This estimated date will allow sufficient time for the District to conduct a search for all responsive records, review the records for information that is exempt for disclosure under the Public Records Act, apply any necessary redactions, and produce an exemption log to explain any redactions made to the records.\r\n\r\nAlthough these records were previously provided to requesters in response to public records requests, they will all have to be reviewed for student information that is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and other applicable exemptions related to both students and employees, as many of the records requests responsive to your request were made by families of students or District employees themselves.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that the above estimated date of completion is an estimate, and may be subject to change depending on a variety of factors, including the volume of records that are responsive to this request. If we require additional time to provide you with records responsive to your request, we will be sure to notify you in writing.\r\n\r\nThe District will contact you with an initial estimate of any applicable costs for the first installment of records before providing you with that installment, and will also provide you with a total estimate of the costs for the entire request when we are able.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nCheryl\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D7DA34.9E015140]<http://ckschools.org/>\r\nCheryl Portier - Administrative Assistant\r\nCentral Kitsap School District | Operations | P O Box 8, Silverdale, Wa., 98383\r\nPhone:  (360) 662-1616 | Fax:  (360) 662-1611 | Email:  cherylpo@ckschools.org<mailto:cherylpo@ckschools.org>\r\nFollow Us!

You had asked earlier that we let you know an estimate of final cost. The actual amount cannot be determined ahead of time. However many of the records are native electronic files that won\u2019t require printing or scanning. With that, overall estimate is under $300.  We will invoice you as production costs equal $5.00 or more.\r\nRegards,\r\nCheryl\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D908BC.8AF66E20]<http://ckschools.org/>\r\nCheryl Portier\r\nPhone:  (360) 662-1616\r\nEmail:  cherylpo@ckschools.org",

The office will provide an estimate of the time required to respond to the request, and may provide an estimate of copying costs pursuant to a specific request seeking an estimate of cost. If the requestor believes the amount of time or estimated costs stated are not reasonable, the requestor may petition the public records officer for a formal review under WAC 44-06-120.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this communication CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE of intent to seek relief via RCW 42.56.550 - Judicial review of agency actions.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***",

L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (26))\r\n\r\nThe BPDA has exercised (1) exemption in reviewing your request:\r\n\r\n*Privacy Exemption: We have redacted the personal email addresses belonging\r\nto individuals that appear in the responsive records. When redacting\r\npersonal email addresses, the Planning Department relied upon the second\r\nclause of the privacy exemption set forth in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7(26)(c). It is\r\nthe position of the Planning Department that the release of personal email\r\naddresses would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. In\r\ntaking this position, the Planning Department believes that such\r\ninformation constitutes \"intimate details of a highly personal nature,\" as\r\npersonal email addresses are not typically otherwise available for public\r\nconsumption. In weighing the protection of privacy interests versus the\r\npublic interest in disclosure, the Planning Department ultimately\r\ndetermines that providing this information would amount to an unwarranted\r\nintrusion into the privacy of the individuals. Further, any public interest\r\nin the disclosure of personal email addresses does not outweigh the privacy\r\ninterest held by the individuals.  *\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Massachusetts law, you may appeal this response to the Supervisor of\r\nRecords in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth.

Govt. Code section 6250, et seq., hereinafter the \u201cCPRA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) seeking records for an incident on April 15, 2017, for Officers Louis Lozano, Serial No.35355 and Eric Mitchell, Serial No. 40169, pursuant to Penal Code Section 832.7 (as amended by SB1421 effective January 1, 2019). \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the CPRA.\u00a0It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government.\u00a0The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession.\u00a0Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1.\u00a0The law also allows for nondisclosure of records that are otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 6254(a); 6254(b); 6254(c); 6254(f); 6254(k); and 6255.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Department also recognizes that Penal Code Section 832.7 \u2013 which generally makes all peace officer personnel records confidential and undisclosable \u2013 was amended on January 1, 2019, by Senate Bill 1421 to create an exception from that general confidentiality requirement for the following four categories of officer personnel and investigatory records:\u00a0records relating to the report, investigation, or findings of (i) an incident regarding an officer-involved shooting; (ii) an incident involving the use of force by an officer resulting in death or great bodily injury; (iii) an incident involving a sustained finding of sexual assault by an officer involving a member of the public; and (iv) an incident involving a sustained finding of dishonesty by an officer directly related to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime or of the investigation of misconduct by another officer.\u00a0Pen. Code \u00a7 832.7(b)(1)(A)-(C).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Department has conducted a search and has disclosable records responsive to your request in regard to sustained complaints of dishonesty, pursuant to Penal Code \u00a7 832.7(b)(1) for Officers Louis Lozano, Serial No.35355 and Eric Mitchell, Serial No. 40169. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease note that, pursuant to Penal Code Section 832.7(b)(5), the Department is required to redact disclosable records for several enumerated purposes, including to remove personal data or information; to protect the anonymity of complainants and witnesses; to protect confidential medical, financial, or other similar information; and where disclosure of the record would pose a significant danger to the physical safety of the subject officer or other persons. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAt this time, the Department is still in the process of identifying all possible records responsive to your request.\u00a0In regard to the records we have identified responsive to your request, due to the large number of requests for similar records the Department is processing pursuant to the above criteria, we are currently unable to provide you with an estimated date records responsive to your request will be available.\u00a0However, we will continue to provide you with updates on any future developments regarding your request, including when the records are available.\u00a0Thank you again for your patience and understanding.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe also invite you to visit our SB1421 web page, where you will find similar requested records related to officer involved shootings, uses of force with great bodily injury, sustained complaints of sexual assault, and sustained complaints of dishonesty published on our web page.\u00a0The Department uploads documents on a weekly basis when documents become available.\u00a0Please see link below. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lapdonline.org/lapdsb1421\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLAPD Risk Management and Legal Affairs Division, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern,\r\n\r\nI represent Jason Koebler and VICE Media Group in connection with the CPRA request identified above.  I am writing to object to the Department's refusal to produce video and audio recordings, and to request that the Department produce these records immediately, as required by law. \r\n\r\nFor ease of reference, I am attaching previous correspondence about the request to this email.\r\n\r\nThe Department has already acknowledged that the requested records are subject to the requirements of the CPRA and that they are not subject to the exemption for peace officer personnel records because they relate to \"a sustained finding of dishonesty by an officer directly related to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution of a crime or of the investigation of misconduct by another officer,\" within the meaning of Penal Code \u00a7 832.7.  See emails dated 2-10-22 and 4-20-22 (attached).\r\n\r\nThe Department has not cited any exemption that would justify refusing to produce these records.  The Department's only stated reason for the refusal was that \"[w]e do not have the skilled staff or technology to produce [audio or video] files.\"  But the law does not appear to recognize any such exemption, nor did the Department cite one.  \r\n\r\nTo the contrary, the CPRA mandates that an agency \"shall make the information available in any electronic format in which it holds the information.\"  Cal. Gov't Code \u00a7 6253.9(f).(emphasis added).  Thus, if the Department maintains these records as audio and video files, which it appears to acknowledge that it does, the statute requires the Department to produce them in this form. \r\n\r\nThe language of the Penal Code regarding these records is similarly mandatory.  Penal Code \u00a7 832.7 (records related to sustained finding of dishonesty \"shall be made available for public inspection pursuant to the California Public Records Act\") (emphasis added).   \r\n\r\nIn light of these clear statutory mandates, I respectfully request that the Department make the audio and/or video records available to Mr. Koebler without further delay.  In recognition of the staffing or technological difficulties cited by the Department, Mr. Koebler is willing to come to the location where the records are stored and inspect them, and to record copies himself using his cell phone or other portable recording device.   See Cal. Gov't Code \u00a7 6253(a)-(b) (public records must be made available for both inspection and copying).  \r\n\r\nI trust that such an arrangement will alleviate any staffing or technology concerns the Department may have.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm that you will make the audio and video records available to Mr. Koebler by responding to this email.\r\n\r\nThis email does not constitute a complete statement of VICE or Jason Koebler's rights or remedies in this matter, all of which are expressly reserved.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nYONATAN BERKOVITS\r\nVP, Business & Legal Affairs\r\nVICE Media\r\nyonatan.berkovits@vice.com",

        "communication": "It has come to my attention from the posted video of the October 23, 2024 Board of Visitors Executive Committee meeting and the VMI Board of Visitors Dashbord that at least one public comment on this issue address to the Board was not posted until substantially after the meeting. This appears to violate the FOIA and failure to post it also prohibited the public from identifying it (and possibly other correspondence sent directly to Mr. Watjen, Maj. Gen. Wins, and Mr. Adams on this subject. Further, during the session when the BOV discussed this issue Maj. Gen. Wins noted the following:\r\n\r\n1. During the ExCom Major General Wins stated a transmittal letter was going out to the BOV with the \"Permit\" and \"MOU\" for The Cadet. These documents should be included inthe response to my request.\r\n\r\n2.\tDuring the ExCom the Maj. Gen. Wins also said that the \"Permit\" the cadets would receive was based on the last known \"Original Permit\" from The Cadet when it was operational years ago and that it was just slightly updated for the new BlueBook changes, etc.  \"Lee Albert and, and his staff did a fair amount of research, uh, to dig up the last existing permit.\" - This document and all related shoudl be included in the response to my request.\r\n\r\n3.\tDuring the ExCom Maj. Gen. Wins also stated that and a large number of the Commandant\u2019s staff  and \u201cthe entire Executive Staff\u201d except the athletic director were involved in developing the Permit and the MOU. The statement was made that it was \u201cfully coordinated\u201d and ready to go. \"We've had the Dean personally involved taking, uh, taking a stab at getting this thing.... I would say that, umm, uh, it, it's a, it's been amazing to me that over, uh, the period of all this time that it's taken, uh, that it has taken the, the direct involvement of the Superintendent and/or the direct involvement of, uh, the Dean, uh, to get this done.\" Also, \"  \"through the efforts of, uh, pretty much the entire executive staff, with the exception of the athletic director, we've been working on the development of a permit and an MOU for the eight or nine members of The Cadet staff. ...  I think one of the things that, through this process, particularly with MY direct involvement we went back based on the direction I gave and, and we're gonna apply the permit just like we've applied every other permit.\" - records related to these interactions should be included in the response to my request. \r\n\r\n4. During the ExCom the Superintendent stated \"....permits don't get negotiated... permits are under the purview of the Commandant. We've had the Commandant staff taking a stab at this thing.\" - Understanding that VMI is a military school and given the Superintendent's previous pblic comments in previous Board sessions that VMI supports freedom of speech within certain constraints and that he is mandating the cadets have a faculty advisor for their paper (also mentioned in the public comments posted to the BOV website\", VMI should be able to provide the records showing the exceptions and the constraints on Freedom of Speech he referened in regard to this matter with The Cadet. \r\n\r\nAlso, responsive records shoudl include the legal authority the Superintendent has to direct an independent student newspaper have a facult advisor or withold \"privileges\" (however VI defines them) from cadets unless they agree to a faculty advisor.  For clarification, it would help to know if this drective is in the form of a lawful order that the Superintendent is somehow empowered to issue. \r\n\r\nDue to the discovery of the apparent existence of these records it is appropriate for VMI to entend the end date of my request until today for all other records requested based on my only now discovering thia information and the apparent witholding of the public comments posted to the BOV and the fact this topic was not on the published agenda. \r\n\r\n",

You accepted payment of the request on October 28, 2024 and as of that date you were going to notify the FOIA Officer to begin processing so no search work was completed. We asked when paying that the search end date be when you started processing the request. We were not informed when that started. In addition, The Executive Committee meeting in question was 23 October 2024. Five days BEFORE you received payment and started the search sometime after that. The scope of our ORIGINAL request was for all records/documents was \"all correspondence and other records of any kind sent to and/or received by VMI Board of Visitors President John Adams, former VMI BOV President Thomas Watjen, and/or VMI Supeintendent Cedric Wins sent to or from any person or organization, VMI and/or VMI Alumni Association staff, contractor and/or employees on the subject of The Cadet newspaper as well as any records, correspondence, records, etc. sent to or received from the VMI Alumni Agencies as well as internal VMI records regarding The Cadet newspaper.\" Maj. Gen. Wins' statement in the ExCOM indicates the transmittal letter with the MOU and permit woudl go out soon after the meeting.  IIf so, they shoudl already be covered in the scope of my original request. If this DID NOT go out before you statred searching records for my request, please let me know when it did go out and I will submit a new FOIA.\r\n\r\n2. During the ExCom the Maj. Gen. Wins also said that the \"Permit\" the cadets would receive was based on the last known \"Original Permit\" from The Cadet when it was operational years ago and that it was just slightly updated for the new BlueBook changes, etc. \"Lee Albert and, and his staff did a fair amount of research, uh, to dig up the last existing permit.\" - This document and all related shoudl be included in the response to my request.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Maj. Gen. Wins statement in the ExCom that and a large number of the Commandant\u2019s staff and \u201cthe entire Executive Staff\u201d except the athletic director were involved in developing the Permit and the MOU.

I think one of the things that, through this process, particularly with MY direct involvement we went back based on the direction I gave and, and we're gonna apply the permit just like we've applied every other permit.\" - Those actions were all stated to have occured before the Excom and so preceeded my payment and when VMI began the search (please provide that date) so they are within the scope for all records/documents involving the individuals named.\r\n\r\nI can understand your rationale for a new FOIA regarding my request VMI to provide the records showing the exceptions and the constraints on Freedom of Speech he referened in regard to this matter with The Cadet and I will initiate a FOIA for those subject to your response tto the issues above.\r\n\r\nFurther, Your response on the scope of the search appears to indicate you are limiting it to IT reecords of emails that you may be limiting to the only VMI servers and and emails for the three individuals.

The law only allows for citizens to request records that already exist. Your request was for communication and records between July 1, 2024, and the date of the request, October 7, 2024. The original request does not cover any time after October 7, 2024.\r\n\r\nYou claimed the October 7, 2024, time period should be extended to October 21, 2024, due to the \u201cdelay in coordinating\u201d the request. The Institute has accommodated this request even though no such delay existed as VMI responded in a timely manner in accordance with the law. The FOIA staff began processing the request on the day the invoice was sent to you (October 21, 2024). Any request for records that did not exist prior to October 21, 2024, constitutes an expansion of the scope of the request and should be submitted as a new request.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the original request did not include records prior to July 1, 2024, much less records from more than seven years ago (#2 from 10/31/24 correspondence). The original request also did not include a request for records related to \u201cexceptions and constraints on free speech\u201d (#4 from 10/31/24 correspondence). The original request also did not include a request for records related to \u201cthe legal authority the Superintendent has to direct an independent student newspaper have a facult [sic] advisor or withhold privileges\" (10/31/24 correspondence). These all constitute an expansion of scope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at Virginia Military Institute.<br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

As such, VMI will require up to an additional seven business days to respond to your request.\" This was right around when I received a note saying the FOIA officer woudl be notified I paid. Since the seacr has not commenced at that time I thought it reasonable (and still do) that the time frame for the search could be extended to start the date you actually begin the search for responsive records for which I paid. There should be no substantial increase in workload (if any).\r\n\r\nFor #1 & #2, it did not seem like a great deal of work to include them since from the comments it appeared they were readily available and currently being used in the staff process. While I disagree, I accept your decision not to and I will file a seperate FOIA at a later date for this document.\r\nTransmitttal letter.\r\n\r\nFor #3, again I do not see any sgnificant workload but based on your refusal I will submit a seperate FOIA. However, I expect all actions up to the end date of my search  to be included under the original scope as Maj. Gen. Wins clearly established this effort has been ongoing for some time.\r\n\r\nFor #4, It is reasonable to assume these woudl be provided in the interest of full transparency. Given your response that you refuse I will submit another FOIA at a later date for these.\r\n\r\nAs for the \"legal authority the Superintendent has to direct an independent student newspaper have a facult advisor or withold \"privileges\" (however VMI defines them) from cadets unless they agree to a faculty advisor. For clarification, it would help to know if this drective is in the form of a lawful order that the Superintendent is somehow empowered to issue,\" it woudl be in the best interest of transparency for VMI to provide these, but based on your refusal I will submit a seperate FOIA for these.",

I'm having to manually pull the information and rescan everything in order to get a quick count of the different category. It's a massive undertaking and I have been working on it since my computer has been recently up and running. The furthest I've gotten is down to 2022-2023 files/documents. We are working to see if we can locate any of the annual reports done over the years that we've sent to accreditation.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1.\tAny and all documents relating to or filed in connection with school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request such documents produced to include, but not limited to, the following columns:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such a production of the documents in question 1 is not possible, please provide any reports, incident notes, status updates, or documents which were submitted to DESE as the result of a school based arrest or any such referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement or arrest, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt.

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, AND Magazine, Unicorn Riot, and more. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and and the journalist non-profit, MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

These are not legal reasons to deny records, nor can the Agency reasonably claim that a proper, reasonable search was conducted which found precisely no records, including no records of files destroyed or transferred to NARA.\r\n\r\nI am further appealing the redactions in this \"release,\" as they are prima facie inappropriate. \r\n\r\nI suggest you think about how this will go in court (and look to the public if it went to court) and grant the appeal.",

A response to your request is due October 28, 2024. However, additional time is needed to respond to your request. In accordance with Section 3(e) of FOIA (5 ILCS 140/3(e)), ISP is extending the response due date for an additional five business days for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nThe requested records are stored in whole or in part at another location.\r\n\r\nThe request requires the collection of a substantial number of records.\r\n\r\nThe request is stated in categorical terms and requires an extensive search for the records requested.\r\n\r\nX  The requested records have not yet been located and additional time is needed to complete the search.\r\n\r\nX  The requested records require examination and evaluation to determine if the documents are exempt from disclosure and/or must be redacted.\r\n\r\nX  The requested records cannot be provided within the prescribed time frame without causing an undue burden or interfering with the operation of ISP.\r\n\r\nConsultation is needed with another public body in order to respond to the request.\r\n\r\nISP handles requests for video records separately.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAny bureau records related to the architect Paul Albert Thiry (born September 11th, 1904 - died 1993). Of particular interest would be personal correspondence between Paul Thiry and directors L. Patrick Gray, Bill Ruckelshaus and Clarence Kelley regarding the planning, design, dedication of, and reaction to, the opening of the J. Edgar Hoover Building on September 30th of 1975. Mr. Thiry acted as a consultant during this process. Thiry was also actively engaged in civic issues in the city of Seattle. Thiry was also appointed by President Kennedy to the U.S. Capitol Planning Commission and the President's Council on Pennsylvania Avenue - both appointments who have presumably generated a background check and documentation from the bureau. \r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about the architect Paul Albert Thiry from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Thiry held by the Seattle Field Office. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Paul Albert Thiry. \r\n\r\nFor a brief synopsis of his career please see:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.docomomo-wewa.org/architect/thiry-paul/\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Paul Thiry.\r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Paul Thiry. \r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nPlease Note: A previous FOIA request to the bureau, \"FBI file 66-HQ-11201 \" titled: \"Planning And Design of the FBI Headquarters Building 66-HQ-11201\" mentions Thiry by name. Please disregard this document in your search.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Dear Department of Transportation:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nThis request covers every Department of Transportation component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc., that has a Chief FOIA Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, or substantially equivalent position. See \"# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\" below.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request imposes an affirmative obligation to take immediate steps to preserve responsive records against spoliation, including both any automated or routine record deletion and any act by an employee to delete such records.\r\n\r\nThis is an explicit evidence preservation demand, and the documents sought relate to ongoing and/or currently contemplated litigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, please note that this request is directed at BOTH Department of Transportation itself, and ALL components thereof, including any component agencies.\r\n\r\nAt your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7). \r\n\r\nIn particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is part of an all-agency FOIA audit. Your performance will be tracked, analyzed, and published.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful patterns or practices discovered in the course of this audit will be highlighted for public shaming, and will likely be litigated for permanent injunctions.\r\n\r\nAny particularly good performance will, by the same token, be highlighted for public praise.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Chief FOIA Officers' desktops\r\n\r\nI hereby request:\r\n\r\n1. for the component's\r\na) Chief FOIA Officer,\r\nb) Chief Privacy Officer, and\r\nc) any substantially equivalent component official\r\n\r\n(\"Officer\"):\r\n\r\n2. the entire content of\r\na) the Officer's physical desktops, i.e. everything on the actual desk(s) where they work\r\n\r\nI) including all other office surfaces, e.g. cabinets, tables, in/out boxes, shelves, etc in the Officer's office(s)\r\n\r\nII) excluding:\r\ni) computers (including desktop, laptop, and phone);\r\nii) USB drives;\r\niii) generic office supplies, i.e. any item that could be purchased off the shelf at a store such as Office Depot in identical form by a member of the general public;\r\niv) tear-off daily flip calendars;\r\nv) purely personal capacity items;\r\nvi) keys;\r\nvii) anything within a fully enclosed hard sided container (e.g. exclude the contents of a desk / cabinet drawer, lockbox, or picture frame \u2014 but envelopes laying on a desk [and their contents], items in open-ended organizers, etc are not excluded);\r\nviii) books or hard-bound booklets, except for the front and back covers; and\r\nix) CDs or DVDs, except for the label (i.e. what is captured when you place the disc on a flatbed scanner); and\r\n\r\nIII) formatted as 600 DPI color scans to PDF, one PDF per item (named logically based on the item), run through Adobe Acrobat Pro's \"enhance scanned PDF\" tool with the settings:\r\n* recognize text on\r\n* all pages\r\n* apply adaptive compression: grayscale JPEG2000, monochrome JBIG2 (lossless), maximum quality\r\n* output: searchable image, document language set to the document's actual language\r\n* filters: deskew on, background removal off, descreen off, text sharpening off;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nb) the Officer's computer desktop(s), i.e. the \"desktop folder\" of their account on every computer that they use in official capacity\r\n\r\nI) in the exact original file format as stored on the computer, encapsulated into a .ZIP or .TAR.GZ archive set to preserve all metadata and folder structure;\r\n\r\n3. as the above exist at the time anyone in the component first learns of this request.\r\n\r\n(I.e., no clearing out the desk before searching it. You may of course continue to use the office normally, but this request creates a hold for its exact content at that one snapshot in time.)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. For hold preservation validation purposes, please take and provide digital photos of the Officer's entire office, showing all items in plain view at the time this request was received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe search time for this request should be zero, since all responsive records are literally already in plain view in the Officer's office.\r\n\r\nThis request is very clearly delineated such that search should be easy and the locations of records clearly identified.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to negotiate terms, we are open to doing so, but only if you provide actual reasons, not conclusory and inapposite statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n### \r\nFiat Fiendum FOIA template \r\nVersion 5.0\r\n###\r\n\r\n# FOIA template structure\r\n\r\nAll content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, \u00a7 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  \r\n\r\nPlease read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Template version updates\r\n\r\nIf you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional FOIA requests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\"All parts of the record\" means that the \"record\" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:\r\na) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);\r\nb) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;\r\nc) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;\r\nd) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; \r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Related database records\" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 2\", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"[Alice's cell #]\". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1.\r\n\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\n\u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",

I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee. The OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat. 2477 .)\r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING. \r\nI am seeking expedited processing. In any denial of my request for expedited processing the Agency must state in detail how my request does not meet requirement and who, by name, was involved in the denial determination.\r\n1.\tThe  subject is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. \r\na.\tThe next Chief FOIA Officers Concil is April 21, 202 where this matter will be addressed.\r\n\r\n2.\tInformation is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity/malfeasance. \r\na.\tSee paragraph 1 above.\r\nb.\tI am an individual primarily engaged in dissemination of information via extensive email lists, blogs, coordination with Open Government Advocate Organizations and members of the media.\r\n\r\nIn any denial of my request for expedited processing, I am seeking that the Agency identify who, by name and email was consulted and that the Agency provide specific justification  as to how my request stated herein does not qualify.\r\n\r\nSTILL-INTERESTED PREEMPTIVE REPLY.  This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n \r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office. There are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default. \r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. \r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later. \r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. \r\n\r\nIn any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues. \r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action  I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter.  No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted or fragmented data.  Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).  \r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals and of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n\r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n\r\nALTERATION/DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS\r\n\r\nWhoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1519 - Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records.

The penalties for the unlawful or accidental removal, defacing, alteration, or destruction of Federal records or the attempt to do so, include a fine, imprisonment, or both (18 U.S.C. 641 and 2071).\r\n36 CFR \u00a7 1230 UNLAWFUL OR ACCIDENTAL REMOVAL, DEFACING, ALTERATION, OR DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS\r\n\u00a71230.3   \r\nUnlawful or accidental destruction (also called unauthorized destruction) means disposal of an unscheduled or permanent record; disposal prior to the end of the NARA-approved retention period of a temporary record (other than court-ordered disposal under \u00a71226.14(d) of this subchapter); and disposal of a record subject to a FOIA request, litigation hold, or any other hold requirement to retain the records.\r\nIMPROPOERLY WITHHOLDING RECORDS\r\n\r\nPursuant to FOIA:  \r\n\u201cWhenever the court orders the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant and assesses against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs, and the court additionally issues a written finding that the circumstances surrounding the withholding raise questions whether agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to the withholding, the Special Counsel shall promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against the officer or employee who was primarily responsible for the withholding. The Special Counsel, after investigation and consideration of the evidence submitted, shall submit his findings and recommendations to the administrative authority of the agency concerned and shall send copies of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employee or his representative. The administrative authority shall take the corrective action that the Special Counsel recommends.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(F)(i).\r\n\r\nPERJURY\r\nWhoever-\r\n(1) having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true; or\r\n(2) in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true;\r\nis guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

It is therefore essential for agencies to take steps that will ensure that they are adequately tracking all of the information necessary to complete the Annual FOIA Report sections detailed below.

Your agency has also been subject to litigation for failures to administer proper procedures that have resulted in deaths from a mass shooting (Parkland, FL).

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?
