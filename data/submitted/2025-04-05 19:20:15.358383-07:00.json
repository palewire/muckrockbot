Any document concerning the disposition, destruction, displacement, or removal of books from the Naval Academy library.\r\n\r\n2. Any document reflecting the search terms utilized to remove books from the Naval Academy library.\r\n\r\n3. Any communications to or from the Office of the Secretary of Defense concerning books at the Naval Academy library. \r\n\r\n4. Any communications to or from Vice Adm. Yvette Davids which mentions any of the following terms: library, book, books, DEI, diversity, EO, executive order, gender, ideology. This request does not include copies of news reports.\r\n\r\n5. Any communications to or from Cmdr. Tim Hawkins which mentions any of the following terms: library, book, books, DEI, diversity, EO, executive order, gender, ideology. This request does not include copies of news reports.\r\n\r\nThese requests are limited to records generated on or after January 20, 2025.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, instant messages, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication. \"Communications\" also includes transcripts, videos, audio, minutes, notes, or other recordings of conversations, meetings, phone calls, or Zoom (or similar) meetings.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.8(e)(1)(i)(B) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the removal of books from a library due to their viewpoints or content.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a breaking news story of public interest. That issue has attracted significant media coverage. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis.\r\n\r\nMedia coverage evidencing the significant public interest in this matter includes:\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/naval-academy-dei-books-removed.html\r\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/02/naval-academy-remove-400-dei-books/\r\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/naval-academy-tosses-400-books-from-library-following-trump-dei-expulsion-orders\r\nhttps://apnews.com/article/military-academies-dei-hegseth-trump-ba9731f24b4eb4bd9c02b568209f97af\r\nhttps://blavity.com/jackie-robinson-mlk-books-naval-academy-dei-ban\r\nhttps://foxbaltimore.com/news/local/naval-academy-will-not-remove-dei-related-materials-from-library\r\nhttps://dailycaller.com/2025/04/02/naval-academy-removes-hundreds-of-books-that-push-dei/\r\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense/3367284/naval-academy-removes-400-books-dei-directive-hegseth/\r\nhttps://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/04/02/hegseth-addresses-naval-academy-ahead-of-reported-book-ban/\r\nhttps://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/maya-angelou-memoir-holocaust-book-among-dei-purge-at-naval-academy-library/3671190/\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/03/naval-academy-dei-books\r\nhttps://thehill.com/homenews/race-politics/5227843-naval-academy-library-books-dei-trump-hegseth/\r\nhttps://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/5228318-the-navy-cant-fight-for-freedom-while-banning-books/\r\nhttps://www.thecollegefix.com/u-s-naval-academy-removes-400-books-that-promote-dei-from-library/\r\nhttps://saraacarter.com/naval-academy-removes-400-books-following-dei-crackdown/\r\nhttps://www.academia.org/naval-academy-purges-dei-books-from-library/\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.12(l), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the policies, procedures, and practices of senior Department officials concerning their interaction with the media, implicating the Speech and Press clauses of the First Amendment.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations, as the information pertains to the policies and underlying information driving decisions by senior Department officials. Disclosing the policies and other information would demonstrate the bases for those decisions, which have attracted substantial public attention, as demonstrated by the articles and press statements cited above. That information is not in the public domain.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law, including its application to members of the press. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

This request does not include copies of news reports.\r\n\r\nThese requests are limited to records generated on or after January 20, 2025.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, instant messages, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication. \"Communications\" also includes transcripts, videos, audio, minutes, notes, or other recordings of conversations, meetings, phone calls, or Zoom (or similar) meetings.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.8(e)(1)(i)(B) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the removal of books from a library due to their viewpoints or content.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a breaking news story of public interest. That issue has attracted significant media coverage. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis.\r\n\r\nMedia coverage evidencing the significant public interest in this matter includes:\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/naval-academy-dei-books-removed.html\r\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/02/naval-academy-remove-400-dei-books/\r\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/naval-academy-tosses-400-books-from-library-following-trump-dei-expulsion-orders\r\nhttps://apnews.com/article/military-academies-dei-hegseth-trump-ba9731f24b4eb4bd9c02b568209f97af\r\nhttps://blavity.com/jackie-robinson-mlk-books-naval-academy-dei-ban\r\nhttps://foxbaltimore.com/news/local/naval-academy-will-not-remove-dei-related-materials-from-library\r\nhttps://dailycaller.com/2025/04/02/naval-academy-removes-hundreds-of-books-that-push-dei/\r\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense/3367284/naval-academy-removes-400-books-dei-directive-hegseth/\r\nhttps://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/04/02/hegseth-addresses-naval-academy-ahead-of-reported-book-ban/\r\nhttps://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/maya-angelou-memoir-holocaust-book-among-dei-purge-at-naval-academy-library/3671190/\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/03/naval-academy-dei-books\r\nhttps://thehill.com/homenews/race-politics/5227843-naval-academy-library-books-dei-trump-hegseth/\r\nhttps://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/5228318-the-navy-cant-fight-for-freedom-while-banning-books/\r\nhttps://www.thecollegefix.com/u-s-naval-academy-removes-400-books-that-promote-dei-from-library/\r\nhttps://saraacarter.com/naval-academy-removes-400-books-following-dei-crackdown/\r\nhttps://www.academia.org/naval-academy-purges-dei-books-from-library/\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.12(l), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the policies, procedures, and practices of senior Department officials concerning their interaction with the media, implicating the Speech and Press clauses of the First Amendment.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations, as the information pertains to the policies and underlying information driving decisions by senior Department officials. Disclosing the policies and other information would demonstrate the bases for those decisions, which have attracted substantial public attention, as demonstrated by the articles and press statements cited above. That information is not in the public domain.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law, including its application to members of the press. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to Frank Rockwell Barnett, aka Frank R. Barnett (October 29, 1921 \u2014 August, 15, 1993; SSN: 331-12-6860). \r\n\r\nMr. Barnett was the founder and president of the National Strategy Information Center (NSIC). The NSIC (EIN: 13-1973342), which incorporated as a nonprofit in the State of New York on November 07, 1962, and operated until March 03, 2016, was a think tank that advocated on national security strategy, low-intensity conflict, intelligence agency operations, and political warfare.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnett also served as the vice president and director of research for the Smith Richardson Foundation (EIN: 56-0611550) between 1955 and 1962, and was a member of the Committee on the Present Danger between 1975 and 1985. He helped to found the American Friends of Russian Freedom, an anticommunist lobbying group, in 1951 along with William Casey, who would go on to serve as the Director of Central Intelligence, and William Donovan, former head of the Office of Strategic Services.\r\n\r\nProof of death is not required as Mr. Barnett's date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records related to the National Strategy Information Center, Smith Richardson Foundation, Committee on the Present Danger, and American Friends of Russian Freedom.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. Please advise if fees will exceed this amount so I might make an arrangement for requesting the records. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Florida Sunshine Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDear Custodian of Records,\r\n\r\nPursuant to Chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes (Florida Public Records Law), I am submitting this request for specific records related to the officer-involved shooting that occurred at or near the Dollar General in Mossy Head, Florida, involving Deputy William \u201cBill\u201d May and Mr. Timothy Mark Jarvinen, resulting in the deaths of both individuals.\r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest. Preliminary reports indicate that Mr. Jarvinen had no criminal history in Walton County or Northwest Florida, was a legal concealed carry permit holder, and had no record of prior violence. Publicly available information shows no indication of instability or aggression. In contrast, recent narratives claim the deputy was escorting Mr. Jarvinen out of the store and that shots were fired once both men were outside\u2014with the deputy behind him.\r\n\r\nGiven this context, the public has a right to know exactly what happened and whether proper use-of-force protocols and de-escalation practices were followed. This request is made not to assign blame, but to uncover facts that matter for public trust and accountability.\r\n\r\nRequested Records:\r\nAll body-worn camera footage and in-car video/audio from Deputy William May and any other deputies present at the scene.\r\n\r\n911 audio recordings, dispatch logs, radio traffic, and CAD reports relating to the incident from the time of the call through the conclusion of the scene.\r\n\r\nFull incident and supplemental reports, including witness statements, officer narratives, and scene diagrams.\r\n\r\nAll store surveillance video (Dollar General and surrounding businesses) acquired by law enforcement or reviewed during the investigation.\r\n\r\nThe complete personnel file of Deputy William May, including:\r\n\r\nUse-of-force records (past and present),\r\n\r\nInternal affairs complaints,\r\n\r\nDisciplinary actions (if any),\r\n\r\nMental health screenings or psychological evaluations tied to employment,\r\n\r\nRelevant training certifications, especially related to de-escalation or crowd control.\r\n\r\nAny emails, memos, or internal communications referencing Mr. Jarvinen or this incident, dated between March 22, 2025 and April 5, 2025, including communications between deputies, supervisors, and public information officers.\r\n\r\nThe Spring Break deployment strategy or assignment roster, specifically indicating how and why Deputy May volunteered for the shift and whether Dollar General or similar retail disturbances were a known issue.\r\n\r\nNote on Intent:\r\nThis is a deeply tragic event.

        "communication": "Dear Nathan Raybeck:\r\n\r\nUnder the West Virginia Freedom of Information Act, \u00a729-B-1-1 et seq., I am requesting an opportunity to inspect or obtain copies of public records that detail the use or allocation of opioid lawsuit settlement funds in Preston County and outline an application for these funds. I am also requesting any documentation related to the review or approval process for these funds, including the names of individuals involved.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting documentation of the amount of funds Preston County has received so far, the application process to apply for funding, the individuals who will review the funding applications, the process by which funds will be awarded, how much funding has been awarded as of March 1, 2025, and to whom it was awarded.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $25. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of West Virginia\u2019s allocations of opioid settlement funds. I am a representative of the news media and my request is related to news gathering purposes. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe West Virginia Freedom of Information Act requires a response to this request be made within five business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records. You can call me at 304-216-6743 or send me an email at heiskell.hannah@gmail.com. My physical address is 1511 University Ave. Morgantown, WV, 26505.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nHannah Heiskell\r\n304-216-6743\r\nheiskell.hannah@gmail.com",
