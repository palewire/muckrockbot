The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

        "communication": "Dear Department of Transportation:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a formal Freedom of Information Act request for the following records.\r\n\r\nThis request covers every Department of Transportation component, including component agencies, departments, offices, OIGs, etc., that has a Chief FOIA Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, or substantially equivalent position. See \"# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\" below.\r\n\r\nAt your discretion, you may either apply only a single tracking number for the whole request tree (acting for all subcomponents), or each subcomponents may apply its own tracking numbers.\r\n\r\nIn either case, you are expected to strictly comply with 5 USC 552(a)(6) and (a)(7). \r\n \r\nIn particular, you are expected to provide notice (by email) of all referrals made, and any other tracking numbers of which you are aware.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis request is part of an all-agency FOIA audit. Your performance will be tracked, analyzed, and published.\r\n\r\nAny unlawful patterns or practices discovered in the course of this audit will be highlighted for public shaming, and will likely be litigated for permanent injunctions.\r\n\r\nAny particularly good performance will, by the same token, be highlighted for public praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Primary request\r\n\r\nA. FOIA case log in electronic system\r\n\r\nI hereby request:\r\n\r\n1. The entire FOIA case log, for the entire period covered by the FOIA office's current electronic FOIA case tracking system.\r\n\r\n### \r\nFiat Fiendum FOIA template \r\nVersion 5.1\r\n###\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n5.1: Updated 508 provisions to refer to Access Board's final rule, 82 FR 5790, and reference https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov .\r\n\r\n# FOIA template structure\r\n\r\nAll content after the version number line above, except for the contact details at the very end, is part of my standard FOIA request template and identical between all of my FOIA requests. The provisions below are generally applicable to all FOIA / Privacy Act requests that I make.\r\n\r\nThere is one exception: the contact details below my signature at the very bottom (provided by MuckRock) are different for each request. Please use the distinct contact details matching each request, to ensure that your responses are correctly tracked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe template provisions specify e.g. additional requests relating to my FOIA/PA requests themselves, form and format, timing, redaction & review, rolling updates, \u00a7 508 compliance, identity, fee waiver, my identity, and the like. They apply to this request, but are not specific to it.\r\n\r\nIf anything in the request-specific section above explicitly overrides anything in this template section, the request-specific section controls. If there is any ambiguity about such an override, please ask me for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe version number above is provided to make it easier for you to process my requests. Since all content (except contact info) below identical version number lines is identical between my requests, you need track only the request-specific portions (at the top) and the latest version of my general provisions.  \r\n\r\nPlease read each new version carefully, as updates generally contain substantive changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Template version updates\r\n\r\nIf you receive any FOIA request from me with a newer template version number than any pending prior FOIA requests from me, please replace the template portion of all prior requests with the updated version, treat the update as a clarification of and/or extension to the prior request, and process each updated request accordingly. Do not close the original request or change its request date. If you are permitted by law to refuse to honor such an update, and you choose to exercise that refusal, please process any differences between the new version and the prior version as a new FOIA request in its own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Additional FOIA requests\r\n\r\nIn addition to the records specified in the request-specific section above, I also request:\r\n\r\nB. all records relating to the fulfillment of this request, such as FOIA logs, documentation of searches, referral emails, etc.\r\n\r\nThis part of the request is to be processed only after you have completed processing all of the above parts. This part does not request that you create any new record; rather, it requests the records that you will have created in processing the above parts, and will therefore exist before you conduct the search for this part. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F. 2d 1095, 1100-05 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (agency must use time-of-search cut-off date, not time-of-request).\r\n\r\nC. all records relating to any complaint(s), FOIA request(s)/appeal(s), and/or Privacy Act request(s)/appeal(s) made by me. This includes, but is not limited to:\r\n1. all records relating to the processing my previous requests, complaints, etc;\r\n2. all records containing the terms my name, email address(es), and other contact or identifying information, listed below my signature; and\r\n3. all records containing any of my complaint, request or appeal identifiers.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) must be processed only after you have processed the items above that line, i.e. such that at the time of the search, the records described will have already been created at the time you conduct the search. Part (C) must be processed after part (B) is completed.\r\n\r\nParts (B) and (C) may overlap with similar prior requests. However, the cut-off date is, at earliest, the date that you complete search on all of the above items. If you wish to administratively merge this request with a prior similar request, I consent on condition that you extend the cut-off date for the prior request, and provide rolling updates. Otherwise, you must treat this as a new request.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all responsive records, I also request:\r\n\r\nD.\r\n1. all parts of the record (i.e. no portion of a record with some responsive portion may be considered \"non-responsive\");\r\n2. all versions of the record, whether or not currently in use;\r\n3. all record metadata, such as dates on which they were drafted, passed, went into effect, withdrawn, or similar events; person(s) / office(s) responsible; authors;  IDs; revision numbers; etc.;\r\n4. a detailed index of all claims of exemption/privilege, regardless of whether the record is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part;\r\naccess to inspect the record directly, in its native electronic format; and\r\n5. if any classification applies, mandatory declassification review (MDR) under E.O. 13526, and the result of the MDR, including any declassified records.\r\n\r\n\"All parts of the record\" means that the \"record\" should be considered to be the most comprehensive record with any responsive portion. For instance:\r\na) if any portion of an email is responsive, the entire contents of all email thread(s) to which that email belongs is also responsive (including attachments);\r\nb) if a record is part of a larger record, such as a responsive table that is in a chapter of a report, then the entire larger record (e.g. the full report) is responsive, together with any appendices, amendments, etc.;\r\nc) if a record is part of a book, the entire book is responsive;\r\nd) if a record is part of a database, all related database records are responsive; \r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Related database records\" has the technical meaning used in relational database management systems (such as SQL). It recursively includes all directly and indirectly related records (starting with all responsive records, include as responsive the full row of each, and recursively include as responsive all rows for which any responsive record has a foreign key or is referenced by a foreign key), together with the schema for all responsive records.\r\n\r\nItems in part (D) should be prioritized at the same level as the record they apply to.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timing\r\n\r\nFor all requests above, the \"cut-off date\" is, at the earliest, the date that you conduct the search.\r\n\r\nThe priority order listed above is only for items that may take extra time to respond to, and must not be taken as blocking response to an otherwise lower priority item that could be released more quickly than a higher priority item that is pending time-intensive search or review.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FOIA IA notice\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is made after the enactment of Public Law No. 114-185, S. 337 (114th), the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 (FOIA IA). The revised statute, as specified in the FOIA IA, applies to this request. FOIA IA \u00a7 6. \r\n\r\nIn particular, please note that:\r\n1. you must provide electronic format documents, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(2) (undesignated preceding text), 552(a)(2)(E) (undesignated following text), 552(a)(3)(B), and 552(a)(3)(C);\r\n2. you may not specify an appeal duration less than 90 days, \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C)(A)(i)(III)(aa);\r\n3. you may not withhold any record unless \"the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in subsection (b), or disclosure is prohibited by law\", \u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(i);\r\n4. you must segregate and partially release records where possible, \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(8)(A)(ii) and 552(b) (undesignated matter following (b)(9)); and\r\n5. you may not claim deliberative process exemption for records more than 25 years old, \u00a7 552(b)(5).\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Record\" defined\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this request, except as otherwise specified, \"record\" means any agreement, appendix, application, assessment, attachment, checklist, circular, contract, correspondence (including but not limited to email), data management plan, documentation of search parameters, email, email attachment, form, guide, handbook, index of records, information consent agreement, information sharing agreement, instruction, interpretation, kit, management instruction, manual, memorandum, memorandum of understanding, notice, notification, opinion, order, plan, policy, policy statement, processing note, publication, recording, referral, report, request certification form, request detail report, response, rule, script, standard operating procedure, submission, talking point, training document, video, or related record described, regardless of publication status.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Anti-duplication exclusion\r\n\r\nThis request specifically excludes providing me with new copies of any records which have been already provided to me or published online for free (e.g. on the agency's online \"reading room\"), in full or identically to the form that would be provided to me under this request (i.e. with exactly the same format, redactions, and claimed exemptions).\r\n\r\nThis is only an exclusion on providing records under this request that are identical to those already provided to me or available online, and only if I am or have already been provided a link to the online version (if \"available online\"). \r\n\r\nThis exclusion is only intended to limit unnecessary duplication or provision, not to limit what records are responsive to this request, nor to permit failure to disclose the location of a responsive record available online. If this exclusion would in any way increase the cost or duration to respond to this request, it is to be ignored to the extent it does so.\r\n\r\nThis request is to be treated as separate from all others that I have filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Forwarding; multi-agency / multi-component records\r\n\r\nPlease forward this request to the FOIA office of every agency component and subcomponent that may have responsive records for independent processing, with a copy to me.\r\n\r\nThis request includes any records held jointly by your agency in conjunction with any other agency and/or department, in interagency and/or interdepartmental systems of records, or by other agencies or third parties (including contractors) acting pursuant to any agreement with your agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimal redaction\r\n\r\nPlease note that the FOIA requires you to service the maximum extent of my request that can be done via e.g. partial redaction of exempt material. If you believe some portions of a record to be exempt because it contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI,  49 CFR 15 & 1520) or classified information (18 USC 798), please provide a version of the record redacted to the minimum extent necessary to remove exempt information (e.g. per  49 CFR 1520.15), along with adequate information to describe the reason for each specific exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redaction of repeatedly occurring content\r\n\r\nWhen redacting any content that appears more than once in the full set of responsive records, please assign a replacement identifier for each, so that your redaction does not obfuscate the commonality.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that responsive records include the names Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diego, and you determine that each of those names are redactable (e.g. under (b)(7)(C)). Rather than redacting each with only the text \"(b)(7)(C)\", replace each instance of \"Alice\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 1\", each instance of \"Bob\" with \"(b)(7)(C) - Person 2\", etc. This e.g. withholds Alice's identity while not withholding the fact of commonality between occurrences.\r\n\r\nPlease use reasonably descriptive identifiers. For instance, if Elizabeth's name is not redacted but her personal cellphone number is, and that cellphone number appears e.g. both in her email signature and elsewhere by itself, it should in both cases be redacted with the same descriptive identifier, such as \"[Alice's cell #]\". For documents, this can be specified in the margins. If space or file format does not permit you to do so, then please use a short code (e.g. \"[#52]\", and provide a table matching codes to full identifiers in your response letter.\r\n\r\nIf you make any such redactions, please keep but do not provide a table matching codes/identifiers to the redacted content, for use in case your redaction is examined or overturned on appeal or in litigation.\r\n\r\nThis is a form and format request pertaining to your process of redaction. Because it only applies in situations when you have already exercised the voluntary decision to alter the records from the original form requested, you have necessarily waived any objection to this section \"creating a new record\", since your act of redaction itself already \"makes a new record\" in that limited sense. This is only about how you do a redaction you have already decided to make.\r\n\r\nThis provision limits the scope of your redaction to the minimum possible extent, so that even if you decide to withhold some particular piece of content, you do not also withhold the fact of its being the same as the same content appearing elsewhere. That fact is itself metadata that is explicitly requested as part of this request.\r\n\r\nIf you decide that the mere fact of two pieces of content being the same is itself withholdable, then please redact it using an identifier that encodes only the reason, and provide a table matching those reason-only identifiers to justifications in your response letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Estimates and rolling updates\r\n\r\nIn order to help tailor my request, please provide an upfront estimate of the time and cost it will take to complete this request, broken down any significant factors that would affect cost to service, number of records in each category, and your estimate of how many records in the category are likely to be exempt.\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with incremental updates, with updated estimates for fulfillment of the remainder, rather than having the entirety of the request be blocked until fully completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No new records; electronic & original format\r\n\r\nThis request does not ask you to create new records. \r\n\r\nIf you determine that a response would require creating a new record that you do not want to create, please first contact me by email with an explanation of what records you have that would most closely match the information requested and might be acceptable substitutes, so that we can reasonably tailor the request.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I specifically request that you do not create new documents in response to this request that are modifications of a digital record, such as page-view images, print views, scans, or the like. No such creation or substitution is authorized by FOIA or the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the same or similar records are held in both electronic and paper formats, this request includes both the paper and electronic versions. The paper version and the digital version are distinct records, and each may contain distinct information such as handwritten or other markings on the paper copy and embedded metadata in the electronic version.\r\n\r\nI specifically request both the original, electronic format record, and (if it contains any additional markings) the paper record.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the native electronic format is proprietary or otherwise not in format accessible by widely available, open source software, I also request\r\n1. an export of the proprietary format into a standard, open format, as described below, and\r\n2. all proprietary software necessary to use and understand the original, proprietary format records.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rehab Act \u00a7 508 compliance\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 5 USC 552(a)(3)(B & C) (E-FOIA), Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, and FOIA IA, I demand that you respond using original, native format, electronic, machine-processable, accessible, open, and well structured records to the maximum extent possible \u2014 for both the content of your response, and any communications about the request (such as response letters).\r\n\r\nThis means, e.g.:\r\n1. native, original format records rather than PDFs or other conversions (see note above re providing both native electronic records and scans of paper records, if both exist);\r\n2. individual files per distinct source record (e.g. one .msg file per email), named clearly using the record's identifier, title, and date, rather than a single file containing multiple concatenated records;\r\n3. records compliant with the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 508, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1;\r\n4. fully digital text records rather than scans, rasterizations, or OCR;\r\n5. complete electronic records, as held on any computer (including phones, servers, backup servers, mail servers, workstations, etc.), including all headers and attachments, fully expanded e-mail addresses, full addresses for address \"aliases\", full lists for \"distribution list\" aliases, all embedded and external metadata, complete bitwise digital copies of the original file, all file headers, and all other file content;\r\n6. blackout rather than whiteout redactions, with every redaction marked with all exemption(s) claimed for that redaction;\r\n7. digital redactions rather than black marker or rasterization;\r\n8. lists and structured data as machine-processable spreadsheets (e.g. CSV, SQL, XSL) rather than word documents (e.g. DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF) or partial printouts (e.g. PDF),\r\n9. open format records (e.g. PDF, AVI, MPG) rather than proprietary format records (e.g. WordPerfect, Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF)) (note above re providing both original, proprietary format records and open format records);\r\n10. scans rather than paper copies;\r\n11. digital audio/video files rather than physical tapes;\r\n12. upload to your Electronic Reading Room (or other publicly accessible server) rather than personal transfer (for all items other than the item requesting records related to me or my requests);\r\n13. email or (S)FTP file transfer rather than CD;\r\n14. email correspondence rather than physical mail; etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Compression, passwords, and uploading large files\r\n\r\nMultiple files may be sent in a combined, compressed form using standard ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and/or RAR formats, or sent as separate files, at your discretion.\r\n\r\nDo not use any password on any files, including ZIP files etc., unless a password was present in the original, native format (in which case, leave it unaltered, and send me the password).\r\n\r\nIf there are any files you prefer not to transfer by email (e.g. if they are >10MB), please upload them to me via the link listed below my signature. Doing so is secure, completely free to you, and I will be notified of the upload.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No physical \"duplication\"; inspection & direct access\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request does not request that you physically \"duplicate\" records, as I do not want you to create any paper or other physical copy for me \u2014 I only want electronic versions (or scans, for records that are not fully available in electronic form). As such, I expect there to be no duplication related costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I specifically request access for inspection of the records, including direct electronic access, in native format, to any electronic records. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Request tracking numbers and estimated completion date\r\n\r\nUpon receipt, and in every followup response, please state your tracking number(s) for this request, as well as your specific estimated completion date. 5 USC 552(a)(7).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Communication about this request and method for responding\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or updates about this request, please contact me by email, using only the MuckRock email address from which this request was sent. Please do not send responses to my personal or organizational email addresses unless I specifically request you to do so.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that all of your responses comply with \u00a7 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, 36 CFR Part 1194, 82 FR 5790, and I\u200bSO 14289\u00ad-1. See https://www.access-board.gov/ict/ & https://section508.gov/ .\r\n\r\nIn particular, please make all correspondence pursuant to this request \u2014 including notification and responsive records \u2014 by email, with native electronic format records, as specified in the request. I do not authorize you to send anything to me by physical mail unless I specifically state otherwise. \r\n\r\nDo not respond using ZixCorp \"Secure Mail\" or any other method that \"expires\" records from being available. Use only actual email and direct attachments, or upload using the link below, unless I explicitly request otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n# \"Reasonable description\" and tailoring\r\n\r\nPlease note that a request need only be \"reasonably described\" in the sense that you understand what is requested and where you can find it. A request is not improper merely because of the amount of responsive records. I will not agree to a limitation premised on this request asking for voluminous records. However, I may agree to a limitation premised on the difficulty of finding particular records or categories thereof, the quality of records available, paper vs electronic format, or similar issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that any of the requested items are not reasonably described, that they would be overly burdensome to fulfill, or that you need any further information, please be specific about what you consider vague. \r\n\r\nPlease include in any response about \"reasonably described\", or any request for narrowing, specific questions I can answer that would clarify matters for you; specific descriptions of what parts of the request more or less burdensome (and why) that could serve as the basis for negotiating a narrower request; and any indexes, finding guides, record categories, record storage practices, likely places that responsive records may be located, or similar information that would allow me to understand your concerns and better tailor the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n# No fees agreed to; non-commercial status; journalistic & public interest waiver\r\n\r\nI am not currently willing to pay for servicing this request. I may be willing to pay if it is necessary; please send a detailed explanation of the costs and their statutory justification, and service the maximum extent of the request that can be done for free in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis request is a qualified request for journalistic, public interest purposes. As such, I request fully waived fees, including both public interest fee waiver and journalistic fee waiver.\r\n\r\n1. Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (FF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, organized for charitable, educational, scientific, and/or literary purposes.\r\n\r\nThis request is a part of FF's bona fide educational and scientific purpose activities, which are public interest purposes as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n2. FF's actions in matters such as this request are non-commercial. My personal interest in the records is also non-commercial.\r\n\r\n3. Both Fiat Fiendum as an organization, and I as an individual, are representatives of the news media and entitled to waiver of all search fees.\r\n\r\n4. I intend and am able to host and publish all received records online to the general public at no charge, as well to publish highlights, analyses, summaries, commentaries, and other creative, original journalistic and scientific work about responsive records through multiple online publications, as part of Fiat Fiendum's work.\r\n\r\n5. The records requested are of significant public interest, entitled to waiver of all duplication fees, since\r\na. they are requested for 501(c)(3) public interest purposes;\r\nb. as above, I both am able and intend to disseminate the files widely;\r\nc. they would contribute greatly to the public understanding of the operations & activities of your agency, in that they are records that directly describe agency operations & activities, as well as the issues and matters described at the top of this letter;\r\nd. they are not currently readily available; and\r\ne. they are likely to be requested by others.\r\n\r\n6. As mentioned above, I am explicitly not asking for any physical duplication, but rather direct server-to-server file transfer or email (or posting on your website). FOIA authorizes \"duplication\" fees strictly limited to your agency's actual costs, and mandates that your agency use the cheapest available requested methods. I consider the actual costs for server-to-server file transfer to be reasonably estimated by, e.g., Amazon S3's pricing (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).\r\n\r\n7. I request that, pending fee waiver determination or appeal, you proceed with this request as if it were in the \"other non-commercial requester\" category.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Requester\r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of both myself, Sai (in personal capacity) and Fiat Fiendum, Inc. (in official capacity).\r\n\r\n\u201cSai\u201d is my full legal name.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am partially blind. I use screen readers (such as VoiceOver and TalkBack). I also need to process documents using computer code (which requires machine-readable data, including metadata). These facts must be considered as part of the basis for, and right to, the form and format requests detailed above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSai\r\nPresident, Fiat Fiendum, Inc.\r\nFiat Fiendum is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation devoted to public interest journalism, government transparency and accountability, individuals' civil rights, and related issues.\r\n\r\nUpload link and physical mail address are below. (Again, do not physically mail responsive records without my explicit request; send all responses electronically.)",

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am appealing the (b)(5) redaction in the document you released to me as part of FOIA request GSA-2021-000215.\r\n\r\nThe reason I am appealing is because it is important to know whether then-president Donald Trump attempted to interfere in the affairs of the General Services Administration (GSA) to force it to delay its ascertainment of then-President-Elect, and current President, Joe Biden. The context for these suspicions is the following articles which describe improper attempts by Mr. Trump to force state officials to illegally overturn the election results in battleground states that Mr. Biden won:\r\n\r\nhttps://apnews.com/ff6433613b075158691797812347f6c6\r\n\r\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is important to know whether Mr. Trump or his White House was similarly exerting improper influence on the GSA. I believe that declassifying the (b)(5) redaction mentioned above would help answer that question. Therefore, I am appealing the (b)(5) redaction.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nChristopher Tidmarsh",

You stated in our request, \"  All\r\nresponsive documents and records related to the planning, activities, and\r\nclosure of the Office of Censorship.\"\r\n\r\nOur office uses the *FOIAonline* portal for FOIA and Privacy Act requests\r\nfor the National Archives and Records Administration's *operational *records\r\n(records created by this agency).  Because your *FOIAOnline *request is for\r\nrecords that may be textual *archival *records (records created by or\r\noriginated in a different agency but that may have been transferred to the\r\nlegal custody of NARA), we have forwarded it to our *Office of Research\r\nServices, Textual Reference (RR2R)* staff who handle FOIA requests for\r\narchival records.\r\n\r\nSince *Research Services* does not process FOIA requests through\r\n*FOIAOnline*, we removed your request from the *FOIAOnline* website.\r\nTextual Reference will assign you a new tracking number, and respond\r\ndirectly to you. In the future, if you need to follow up with that office,\r\nplease contact them at the address below, or electronically via email\r\n(email is preferred).\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\nResearch Services, Textual Reference Branch (RR2R)\r\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 2400\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740\r\n\r\nBy phone: 301-837-3091\r\nBy fax: 301-837-1752\r\nBy email: archives2reference@nara.gov\r\n\r\nFor your reference, a copy of your request and your one attachment is\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nPlease visit our website at www.archives.gov/foia for further information\r\nabout submitting a FOIA request to NARA.  On our main website,\r\nwww.archives.gov, you can learn more about the resources we offer to the\r\npublic, and you can access our online catalog.\r\n\r\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, and pursuant to guidance received from the\r\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB), NARA has adjusted its normal\r\noperations to balance the need of completing its mission-critical work\r\nwhile also adhering to the recommended social distancing for the safety of\r\nour staff. As a result of this re-prioritization of activities, you may\r\nexperience a delay in receiving a substantive response to your FOIA\r\nrequest.

Your request was\r\nreceived in this office on July 29, 2021 and assigned the case number\r\n21-47642.\r\n\r\nRecords of the Office of Censorship are held in *Record Group 216: Records\r\nof the Office of Censorship*. The citation you provided from the Guide to\r\nFederal Records (216.2.1) refers to the following series:\r\n\r\nAdministrative Subject Files, 1941 - 1945\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1215884> (Entry PI-54 1)\r\nOversize Files from the Administrative Subject Files, 1941 - 1945\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1216310> (Entry PI-54 2)\r\nIndex to the Administrative Subject Files, 1941 - 1945\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1217256> (Entry PI-54 3)\r\nA History of the Office of Censorship, 1941 - 1945\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1217264> (Entry PI-54 4)\r\n\r\nWe also hold many other series created by this agency which are described\r\nin the National Archives Catalog\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/search?q=*:*&f.ancestorNaIds=543&sort=naIdSort%20asc&f.locationIds=33&rows=100>.\r\nThe records in Record Group 216 have not been digitized; however, they are\r\nunrestricted and available for research.\r\n\r\nThe National Archives is staffed to provide recommendations and information\r\nrelated to specific bodies of records. However, given the limitations on\r\nstaff resources, we do not generally conduct substantive research in\r\nresponse to requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act, except in\r\ncircumstances where documents are easily locatable.\r\n\r\nWe would be happy to make the records and relevant finding aids available\r\nto you or your representative in our research room at the National Archives\r\nat College Park, MD.\r\n\r\nThe National Archives is starting to resume research room operations.\r\nSeveral locations have already begun pilots to test research room policies\r\nand procedures that promote social distancing, while otherwise allowing us\r\nto serve records in a secure manner.\r\n\r\nOur services will look very different from the services provided prior to\r\nCOVID-19. Research visits will be by appointment only and will require a\r\nvirtual consultation prior to the onsite visit.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in scheduling a research visit at the National\r\nArchives in College Park, MD, please email archives2reference@nara.gov to\r\nbegin the virtual consultation process.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to visit our facility, you may wish to employ a\r\nprofessional researcher to carry out research on your behalf. The National\r\nArchives maintains a list of professional researchers online:\r\nhttp://www.archives.gov/research/hire-help/.\r\n\r\nYou asked for a waiver of the fees normally charged for providing\r\nresearchers with copies of archival records. The fee and fee waiver\r\nprovisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), however, do not apply\r\nto archival records. The FOIA fee section states that \"Nothing in this\r\nsubparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable under a statute specifically\r\nproviding for setting the level of fees for particular types of records.\"\r\n[5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(vi)]. Accordingly, the NARA fee statute, 44 U.S.C.\r\n2116(c), and implementing regulations at 36 C.F.R. Part 1258, apply\r\nexclusively to your request, under which the National Archives does not\r\nwaive reproduction charges for individual requesters. Our inability to\r\ngrant you the requested fee waiver does not constitute a denial for the\r\npurposes of the FOIA.\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this a denial of your FOIA request. However, if you are\r\nnot satisfied with our action on this request, your options for appeal and\r\ndispute resolution are outlined in the attachment. If you have any\r\nquestions, you may reach us at archives2reference@nara.gov.\r\n\r\nThis completes the processing of your request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid Castillo\r\nArchives Specialist\r\nTextual Reference Archives II Branch (RR2RR)\r\nNational Archives at College Park, MD",

        "communication": "FOIA APPEAL\r\n\r\nRe: Freedom of Information Act Appeal\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nOn July 25, 2021, I requested documents under the Freedom of Information Act seeking responsive documents and government records related to the planning, activities, and closure of the Office of Censorship. My request was assigned the following identification number: NARA-NGC-2021-001189. \r\n\r\nOn July 29, 2021, I received a response to my request in a letter signed by Wanda Williams (Deputy Freedom of Information Act Officer/Archivist at the Office of General Counsel (NGC) at the National Archives and Records Administration) letting me know that my request had been transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration Research Services Textual Reference Branch (RR2R).\r\n\r\nOn August 5, 2021, I received a follow-up response to my request in a letter signed by David Castillo (Archives Specialist at the Textual Reference Archives II Branch (RR2RR)) informing me that the requested records were unrestricted and available to the public. However, instead of providing those documents or quoting a fee for digital copies of the available records, Mr. Castillo informed me that his agency does \"not generally conduct substantive research in response to requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act, except in circumstances where documents are easily locatable.\" He did not acknowledge the fact that my request included a link to a government website that described the exact location of each record included my request (https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/216.html#216.2.1).\r\n\r\nMr. Castillo's letter also did not provide me with a quote for a fee for copies of the requested records. Instead, Mr. Castillo invited me to schedule an appointment to visit his agency in person and make the copies myself; if that was not possible, he suggested that I consider hiring an independent researcher to do the work instead.\r\n\r\nMr. Castillo's letter also let me know that while his agency did not approve my request for a fee waiver as a member of the news media, they also did not deny my request for a fee waiver. I have no idea what that means -- it should be one or the other, not both at once.\r\n\r\nThat said, I appeal the decisions related to my request.\r\n\r\nThe documents that were withheld must be disclosed to me under the FOIA. The FOIA does not empower government agencies to withhold documents from requesters when those agencies simply don't feel like locating the requested records or making copies of them.\r\n\r\nI also appeal the decision to deny by circumvention my request for a waiver of fees. I believe that I am entitled to a waiver of fees. Disclosure of the documents I requested is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest. I am a freelance journalist whose work has been published regularly, and recently, by local and national outlets. You can view my portfolio here: www.erinmariemiller.com/journalism\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about handling this appeal, you may contact me in writing at the email address from which this message originated (116625-05410317@requests.muckrock.com).\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this appeal. \r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Marie Miller\r\nMuckRock News Dept.\r\n116625 411A Highand Ave.\r\nSomerville, MA 02144-2516",

(https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/) \r\nProvisions of the Act allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.\u00a0 We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations outlined on the DHS website, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-28095/freedom-of-information-act-regulations.

If you would like to narrow the scope of your request, please contact our office.\u00a0 We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.] \r\nCBP\u2019s FOIA Division is working hard to reduce the amount of time necessary to respond to FOIA requests.\u00a0 We truly appreciate your continued patience. \r\nFor additional information please consult CBP FOIA website please click on FOIA Act Resources or visit (http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia) http://www.cbp.gov/site-policy-notices/foia.

Please specifically task a search for C. Martinez and Joshua Farnkopf, Esq., as well as any FOIA talkers and responses sent or received by ICE FOIA between February 23, 2023, and April 5, 2023. Your request was received in this office on 4/6/2023.Due to the increasing number of FOIA requests received by this office, we may encounter some delay in processing your request. Per Section 5.5(a) of the DHS FOIA regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, ICE processes FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. Although ICE\u2019s goal is to respond within 20 business days of receipt of your request, the FOIA does permit a 10-day extension of this time period. As your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a thorough and wide-ranging search, ICE will invoke a 10-day extension for your request, as allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If you\u2019re able to narrow the scope of your request please contact our office. Narrowing the scope may speed up the search process. We will make every effort to comply with your request in a timely manner.Provisions of the FOIA allow us to recover part of the cost of complying with your request.  We shall charge you for records in accordance with the DHS Interim FOIA regulations, as they apply to media requesters.  As a media requester, you will be charged 10 cents per page for duplication; the first 100 pages are free.  We will construe the submission of your request as an agreement to pay up to $25.00. You will be contacted before any further fees are accrued.We have queried the appropriate program offices within ICE for responsive records. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that one of the processors in our office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.If you have any questions, please contact FOIA Public Liaison, Fernando Pineiro Jr. at the address above or (866) 633-1182.

My request was assigned the number 23-01724-FOIA and placed in your complex processing queue.\r\n\r\nI hereby request expedited processing of my FOIA request in accordance with the U.S. Department of Justice's guidelines for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nImminent Threat to Life or Physical Safety: The V-safe program is directly related to the monitoring of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination. Given the ongoing pandemic and the critical nature of vaccine safety, timely access to this information could be life-saving for individuals considering vaccination.\r\n\r\nUrgency to Inform the Public: The V-safe program involves actual federal government activity that is of urgent concern to the public. The sooner this information is released, the sooner the public can make informed decisions about their health.\r\n\r\nWidespread and Exceptional Media Interest: The COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination efforts are subjects of exceptional media interest. The integrity of the V-safe program and how it has been managed could significantly affect public confidence in the government's handling of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nGiven these compelling reasons, I also request a rolling release of records as they become available. This would serve the public interest by providing critical information as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n",

Dear Anthony Moser, This correspondence is in response to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request received by the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor on September 19, 2023. The Office of the Mayor took a 5 business day extension to your request on September 27, 2023. You requested: \"To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nRecords sufficient to show the calendar entries for Chief of Staff Rich Giudice for the months of August 2023 and September 2023 to date. Please include entries from any/all calendars associated with Rich Giudice, not limited to his primary email account. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nAnthony Moser \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fmayors-office-885%252Fcos-rich-giudice-calendar-152189%252F%253Femail%253DMOfoia%252540cityofchicago.org&url_auth_token=AAAVakss4kqDBu4naYY4htHES6U%3A1qioKt%3AOK5f73qJG_CutvwFczgLwvfrDgzyUZJON--8vvAI3UY\" \r\nPlease find the attached records responsive to your request. We have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(b) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts \u201cprivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\u201d\u00a0 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b).\u00a0 Section 2(c-5) defines \u201cprivate information\" as: \r\n\r\nunique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses. Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. \r\n\r\n5 ILCS 140/2(c-5).\u00a0 The material we have redacted under this section is access codes.\u00a0 Because these items are specifically exempted under Section 7(1)(b), they have been properly redacted. \r\nWe have redacted certain material pursuant to Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA.\u00a0 That section exempts: \r\n\r\n[p]ersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information.\u00a0 \u2018Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u2019 means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in in which the subject\u2019s right of privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.\u00a0 The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. \r\n\r\nWe have redacted the identity of job applicants under Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA.\u00a0 Individuals who go through an application process or examination process to attain a certain job or position have an expectation that this information would not be publicly disseminated if they are unsuccessful in attaining the position.\u00a0 In 2011 PAC 13060, the PAC cited to an earlier decision to explain why release of all information relating to all unsuccessful applicants is exempt.\u00a0 The PAC stated, \u201c\u2026the fact that an individual is seeking new employment for a position is information that a reasonable person would view as highly personal and the release of that information is likely to be viewed as objectionable by most individuals.\u00a0 Publication of an individual\u2019s application for a position can negatively impact that individual\u2019s current employment\u2026.\u201d\u00a0 Also, in 2010 PAC 6243, the PAC held that the names of applicants who completed the Firefighter/EMT exam are exempt pursuant to Section 7(1)(c).\u00a0 Thus, the Mayor's Office has properly redacted the identity of job applicants under Section 7(1)(c) of FOIA. You have the right to have a denial reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd Street, Springfield, Illinois 62701, (877) 299-3642. You may also seek judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact my office at 312-744-3844.

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) regulations at 32 CFR Part 2002 apply to all executive branch agencies that designate or handle information that meets the standards for CUI.\r\n\r\nI'm working on FOIA request NLRB-2023-001998 for \"all non-exempt fields of the participant and participant_party tables from the NxGen case management system database.\"\r\n\r\nNxGen designates participants to have one of four roles:\r\n\r\n  *   Primary: This is usually the main address of the facility as designated on the charge or petition\r\n  *   Legal Rep: Legal representation for the primary participant\r\n  *   Additional Service: These are people who would be like a cc in letters,  or it could be a secondary address for someone.  For example: many union reps list their official business address as primary, and because they might be located in a remote area or working from home, they have a secondary address or home address listed as an additional service.\r\n  *   Notification: This are the national or international union headquarters.  To become a notification, the organization has to file Form 4702 annually, and the notification party only receives a copy of the charge or petition.\r\n\r\nParticipants also have distinct roles: Employer, Union, Individual, and Union as an Employer.\r\n\r\nNxGen further designates participants as: Charging Party, Charged Party/Respondent, Involved Party, Petitioner, Intervenor, Employer, and Amicus.\r\n\r\nInstead of providing a dump of all the participants in the system, and in order to provide the most relevant case information, my recommendation for participants is to provide the Primary participant information (entity name and address) and exclude the Legal Reps, Additional Services, and Notifications.  Also, because the participant tables do not contain any other case-specific information besides the case number, I would recommend including the case name, date filed, date closed, and case closing reason.  I also recommend information for individual charging parties/petitioners be listed simply as the party type of \"Individual\" and to exclude individuals' personal address  information from your request (we would withheld it per Exemptions 6 and 7(C) if it's not specifically excluded.)  Further, I would also recommend excluding Amicus information since cases can only have Amicus filings if the Board approves it.\r\n\r\nSample R case info:\r\nCase Number\r\nCase Name\r\nCase Filed Date\r\nCase Closed Date\r\nClosed Reason\r\nDispute/Unit State\r\nDispute/Unit City\r\nEmployer Type\r\nEmployer Account Name\r\nEmployer Address1\r\nEmployer Address Address2\r\nEmployer Address City\r\nEmployer Address State\r\nEmployer Address Zipcode\r\nPetitioner Party Type\r\nPetitioner\r\nPetitioner Address1\r\nPetitioner Address2\r\nPetitioner Address City\r\nPetitioner Address State\r\nPetitioner Address Zipcode\r\nUnion Involved Party Type\r\nUnion Involved\r\nUnion Involved Address1\r\nUnion Involved Address2\r\nUnion Involved City\r\nUnion Involved State\r\nUnion Involved Zipcode\r\n09-RC-324532\r\nDunkin' Donuts\r\n08/25/2023\r\n\r\n\r\nOH\r\nCincinnati\r\nEmployer\r\nDunkin' Donuts\r\n850 Eastgate North Drive\r\n\r\nCincinnati\r\nOH\r\n45245\r\nUnion\r\nBakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, Local 57, AFL-CIO, CLC\r\n871 West Marion Road, Suite 202\r\n\r\nMt.

Proof of death is not required as his date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search.

The officer involved in this incident was Michael Stephens. My request includes but is not limited to documents, incident reports, multimedia, body-worn camera footage, arrest filings, and other documentation linked to the incident. It also includes all documents, notes, correspondence, and memoranda evidencing sustained findings reports, and investigations, and all communication and correspondence in whatever tangible medium between the officials, the victims, and the overseeing agency.\r\n\r\nAs per law, police misconduct records are public records and do not qualify for any exemption, and are not listed as confidential records.\r\n\r\nThis information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe New York Open Records Act requires a response time within five days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at shaynacf@stanford.edu or my colleague, Eric Sagara at esagara@stanford.edu or his phone number, (520)275-7506.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Epstein's date of birth was January 20, 1953 . The first 5 digits of his Social Security Number were 090-44.\r\n\r\nInclude all records related to at least two aircraft known to be connected to Epstein: N908JE (registered to JEGE INC) ; N909JE (registration unknown); and N212JE (registered to JEGE LLC and PLAN D LLC).  Include all inquiries to the FAA and answers from the FAA for information requests on Epstein or the listed aircraft from a U.S. Cabinet Department (e.g., Department of Justice),  federal agency (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation), or from a state or local law enforcement agency (e.g., NYPD).\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of all systems of records for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, agencies and companies. FAA systems of records of interest include (but are not limited to): DOT/FAA 801 \u2013 Aircraft Registration Records; DOT/FAA 813 - Civil Aviation Security System; DOT/FAA 815 - Investigative Record System; DOT/FAA 845 - Administrators Correspondence Control and Hotline Information System, ACCIS, Administrator\u2019s Hotline Information System, AHIS, and Consumer Hotline Information System, CHIS; and DOT/FAA 847 - Aviation Records on Individuals. \r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that FAA has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nEPSTEIN is widely reported to have died 8/10/2019 in New York City (see attached article from the NY Times). Records concerning Epstein as a subject should thus be assumed free from FOIA Exemption 6, 7(C) and the Privacy Act.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nT. McElwee\n\n",

        "communication": "Dear Sir or Madam:\r\n\r\nThere are several issues.\r\n\r\nFirst, what you are requesting is a very, very large search.  All records pertaining to Sea Launch, it\u2019s license, safety inspections, etc. is potentially thousands of dollars in search and review.  To the extent we can narrow down \u201call records mentioning or pertaining to\u201d on this licensee, that would help.\r\n\r\nSecondly, many of the records are physical, and again the search and duplication required will be substantial. In addition, our offices are currently closed to non-essential personnel due to COVID-19.\r\n\r\nOn the environmental documents, many of those were formally publicly available, so we are moving those to FAA FOIA Library.  When they are online, we can let you know.  There is no charge for those.\r\n\r\nFinally, we would be unable to find responsive records in the Aviation Safety Reporting System, a system run by NASA.  ASRS records are voluntary reported and de-identified before they arrive to FAA systems.\r\n\r\nIf you do not wish to modify the scope, we will conduct a full estimate of the cost of the search for your review and approval.\r\n\r\nI have found that when working with the public, media, and others on scope issues, it\u2019s a lot easier to have conversation about it, and then follow up with an email for the record.  If you would like to do that, I\u2019m happy to talk.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrian Rushforth\r\nChief of Staff\r\nOffice of Commercial Space Transportation\r\nFederal Aviation Administration\r\n(202) 267-9617",

(37 year old who was promoted by merit votes who runs a tactical team) Samantha Grazziano who wrote the complaint for the warrant (4 year police officer who is on a tactical team) and judge Ursula Walowski who signed the warrant. \r\n\r\nIvan ramos gets most of his warrants signed by Judge  Ursula Walowski who lives in the northwest side of Chicago where a lot of Chicago cops live. Her son goes to a private catholic school named St. Thecla where many Chicago police officers children attend as well.\r\n\r\nSamantha Grazziano who wrote the complaint for the search warrant lives about 2 miles from the judge Ursula Walowski.\r\n\r\nSamantha Grazziano\u2019s best friend who is also a Chicago police officer mother who was a Chicago police officer Elizabeth Mcghee lives like 4 blocks away from Judge Ursula Walowski.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t have any concrete proof as of yet about how they conspire but I have a feeling that either Ursula Walowski is rubber stamping the search warrants or the officers are forging her signature.\r\n\r\nI know it\u2019s kind of unbelievable but I do have proof that is public record of an officer that was forging Judge Ursula Walowski\u2019s signature so that he would be approved overtime hours that he never worked for.\r\n\r\nCan you please get back to me as I\u2019m in desperate need to gather proof that would help my daughters case so she can be set free.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nDominick P.\r\nSent from my iPhone",

The LBPD responded by providing a PDF with two columns (city and zip code) and a row for each officer. The LBPD data shows 81.5% of officers commute from outside Long Beach\u2014many from Covid-19 hotspot in Orange County and one from as far away as Texas. \r\n\r\nThis request is in line with the precedent the ACLU and LA Times have established with the LAPD's public records department.
