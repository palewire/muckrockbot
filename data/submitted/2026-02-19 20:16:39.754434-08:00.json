Records Requested\r\n\r\nI request all records, including cables, meeting logs, attendee rosters, security manifests, photographic evidence, open-source video collection or dissemination or internal briefing summaries, that discuss or list the following individuals as participants, attendees, or delegates at SPIEF 2015:\r\n\r\nJoseph Mifsud (linked to the Russian International Affairs Council).\r\n\r\nJeffrey Epstein (specifically seeking verification of his travel to St. Petersburg during the forum window).\r\n\r\nAnton Andreyev (representing Vdolg.ru or the Roscongress Foundation).\r\n\r\nDaria Timoshenkova (aka Daria Aslanova, representing Vdolg.ru or Roscongress).\r\n\r\nII. Specific Inquiry\r\n\r\nI am seeking to determine if these four individuals were present at the same forum events, specifically within the \"Young Leaders Forum,\" the \"Fintech/IT Innovation\" pavilions, or the plenary sessions organized by the Roscongress Foundation.\r\n\r\nIII. Keyword Search Parameters\r\n\r\nTo facilitate a comprehensive search of electronic records, cables, photo archives and internal databases, I request that the following keywords be used:\r\n\r\nEntities: \"Vdolg.ru\", \"Vdolg\", \"\u0412\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\", \"Roscongress\", \"SPIEF 2015\", \"Young Leaders Forum\", \"P2P lending Russia\".\r\n\r\nIndividuals (Phonetic/Aliases): \"Mifsud\", \"Jeffrey Epstein\", \"Andreyev, Anton\", \"Andreev, Anton\", \"Timoshenkova, Darya\", \"Timoshenkova, Daria\", \"Aslanova, Daria\", \"Aslanova, Darya\", \"\u0414\u0430\u0440\u044c\u044f \u0410\u0441\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430.\"\r\n\r\nTechnical/Operational: \"INN 7714808861\", \"Project Lakhta\", \"Information Operations St. Petersburg\", \"Identity Harvesting\", \"Digital Sovereignty Forum\".\r\n\r\nIII. Targeted Offices\r\n\r\nPlease search the records of the National Security Council (NSC), the Office of the National Security Advisor, and any \"Spot Reports\" or cables shared by the U.S. Embassy in Moscow (specifically the Political-Economic and Regional Security sections).\r\n\r\nNote: Of special interest is the possible convergence of Epstein, Mifsud, Andreyev and Timoshenkova in one event. \r\n\r\nAndreyev and Timoshenkova were pioneers in Russian FinTech and used their expertise to create the financial infrastructure that assisted the Kremlin's 2016 election interference efforts. The Epstein files includes several documents which detail Epstein's interest in attending the networking event and hobnobbing with young Russians in the financial sector. Here is an example: https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01191262.pdf\r\n\r\nPlain language: If Epstein was at this event, documentation of it by the U.S. government would have likely been generated. \r\n\r\nThank you to the Obama Presidential Library and for the library's commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

        "communication": "Dear Michael Michael: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P066761-021826.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G. Callahan \r\nCustodian of Records \r\n \r\nLogin Link: https://mshp.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/Login.aspx",

Since they claim ot have recently reviewed the report and associated documents, those records should be immediately available without any search.\r\n\r\nI am therefore requesting a copy of the 1996 study on VMI going private and all related records supporting it to include, without limitation, any resolutions or actions provided to the BOV with the associated actions, votes, etc. taken.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
