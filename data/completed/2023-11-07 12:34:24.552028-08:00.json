All communications between the Governor's Office and/or the State Education Department and/or Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) regarding the distribution of COVID-19 rapid test kits and N-95 and KN-95 masks to schools, dated from January 1, 2023, to the present.\r\n\r\n2. Records of all requests submitted by school districts and BOCES for COVID-19 rapid test kits and N-95 and KN-95 masks, dated from January 1, 2023, to the present.\r\n\r\n3. Inventory records detailing the quantities of COVID-19 rapid test kits and N-95 and KN-95 masks that have been delivered to each BOCES for distribution to school districts, dated from January 1, 2023, to the present.\r\n\r\n4. Any and all guidelines, memos, or advisories issued by the Governor's Office or the New York State Department of Health (DOH) regarding the distribution of COVID-19 rapid test kits and masks to schools, dated from January 1, 2023, to the present.\r\nreceived on September 18, 2023.\r\n\r\nYour request is granted in part and denied in part.\r\n\r\nPlease find the responsive documents for part one attached.  Records were also redacted and withheld pursuant to Public Officers Law \u00a787(2)(g), as inter/intra agency communications. After a review of such records, it was determined that they contain non-final communications which express opinion, advice, recommendations, and the like (see Public Officers Law \u00a787[2][g][iii]).\r\n\r\nIn response to parts two through four, please be advised the State Education Department does not possess these records. The Freedom of Information Law does not require an agency to prepare any record not possessed or maintained by the agency (Public Officers Law Section 89[3][a]); therefore, those portions of your request are denied.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to contact the NYS Governor\u2019s Office or the NYS Department of Health regarding those portions.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to appeal this response, you may do so within 30 days by emailing FOILappeal@nysed.gov<mailto:FOILappeal@nysed.gov> or writing to:\r\n\r\nBetty A.

Siciliano.  We received it in this office\r\nOctober 10, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rocco Siciliano papers are at the J. Willard Marriott Library at the\r\nUniversity of Utah.  For information about the collection, see the website\r\nat\r\n\r\nhttps://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv75296.\r\n\r\n\r\nI got one hit on my advanced search of the National Archives Catalog at\r\nhttps://catalog.archives.gov/advanced-search in records of the Commerce\r\nDepartment (Record Group 40) at https://catalog.archives.gov/id/131494042. A\r\nfolder title list is attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did a similar search in records of the Department of Labor (Record Group\r\n174) but got no hits in the catalog.\r\n\r\n\r\nA similar search with the Eisenhower Library as the location of the\r\nmaterials resulted in hits on two oral history interviews described at\r\nhttps://catalog.archives.gov/search?q=%22Rocco%20Siciliano%22&levelOfDescription=series%2CfileUnit&referenceUnits=%22Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower%20Library%22&typeOfMaterials=Textual%20Records\r\nwhich may be of interest to you.  See the catalog pages for contact email\r\naddresses.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe make reasonable efforts to assist researchers with their work. As a\r\nmatter of policy, the National Archives is staffed to assist researchers\r\nwith their work, including but not limited to pointing researchers to\r\nhelpful finding aids to begin their research. However, given the\r\nlimitations on staff  resources, we do not generally conduct substantive\r\nresearch in response to requests filed under the Freedom of Information\r\nAct, except in circumstances where documents are easily locatable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will be happy to make the records and their finding aids available to\r\nyou or your representative in the Textual Research Room (Room 2000) here at\r\nthe National Archives at College Park, Maryland.  If you are interested in\r\nhiring a researcher who works for a fee, see the list provided on our\r\nwebsite at https://www.archives.gov/research/hire-help.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this response a denial under the Freedom of Information\r\nAct because the records are open and available for research.  However, if\r\nyou are not satisfied with our action on this request, your options for\r\nappeal and dispute resolution are outlined in the attachment.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nTab Lewis\r\n\r\nTextual Reference Operations\r\n\r\nNational Archives at College Park, Maryland",

Dunbar Academy \r\n2. Tubman Elementary \r\n3. Lindblom HS \r\nTime frame: July 1, 2021 to current \r\nAdditionally, supply any/all reports related to EOCO complaint settlements and/or resolutions. RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; Those portions have been redacted including personal phone numbers, personal email addresses, home addresses, employee identification numbers, medical information, and other highly personal information. Section 7(1)(b) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201c[p]rivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b). Section 7(1)(c) of the FOIA exempts from release \u201c[p]ersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c). Information pertaining to teacher performance\u00a0evaluations has been redacted pursuant to 105 ILCS 5/24A-7.1, which provides \u201c[d]isclosure of public school teacher, principal, and superintendent performance evaluations is prohibited,\u201d and 820 ILCS 40/11, which provides \u201c[d]isclosure of performance evaluations under the Freedom of Information Act shall be prohibited.\u201d Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Furthermore, redactions have been applied pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(a) which exempts from release \u201c[i]nformation specifically prohibited from disclosure by federal or State law\u201d and the corresponding s ection 11 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act which provides that \u201c[a]ll records concerning reports of child abuse and neglect or records concerning referrals under this Act and all records generated as a result of such reports or referrals, shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed except as specifically authorized by this Act or other applicable law.\u201d 325 ILCS 5/11. Redactions have been applied to mask the identities of complainants pursuant to section 7(1)(d)(iv) of the FOIA, which exempts from release \u201c[r]ecords in the possession of any public body created in the course of administrative enforcement proceedings [] but only to the extent that disclosure would\u2026unavoidably disclose the identity of a confidential source, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, or persons who file complaints with or provide information to administrative, investigative, law enforcement or penal agencies.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(l)(d)(iv). Redactions have been made to mask open and frank discussion in the course of decision making, and records pertaining to EOCO matters that are still under investigation have been withheld from release, pursuant to section 7(1)(f) of the FOIA. The section exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Further, records pertaining to EOCO matters that are still under investigation have been withheld from release pursuant to section 7(1)(d)(ii) of the FOIA, which exempts from release \u201c[r]ecords in the possession of any public body created in the course of administrative enforcement proceedings [] but only to the extent that disclosure would\u2026interfere with active administrative enforcement proceedings conducted by the public body that is the recipient of the request.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(d)(ii). These records are inextricably intertwined with a pending administrative enforcement proceeding and releasing the complaints and investigation records at this time, which would thus reveal details of the investigation, investigative technique, and evidence gathered, would jeopardized the outcome of the investigation and the ability of investigators to continue gathering evidence. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Annie Righi Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me.

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for award ID FA865019C6055, for a contract given to General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc. (UEI: SMNWM6HN79X5) in the research area of \"BIOEFFECTS RESEARCH OF DIRECTED ENERGY EFFECTS (BRDEE)\". This contract has an action date of August 30, 2019, and was funded by the Department of Defense through the Department of Air Force. This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Correspondence\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc. and/or its parent company, General Dynamics Corp (UEI: F58HFRNGEL8)\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to its research into the physical effects of directed energy attacks, as currently there is a concern among the members of the media and the public about so-called anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAnomalous health incidents, also known as Havana Syndrome, are events occurring between 2016 and the present day that have resulted in a condition, or a series of related conditions, afflicting intelligence agents and diplomats working for the governments of the United States and Canada. In 2016, the Associated Press reported on a number of such incidents that happened in Cuba that led to the United States pulling staff from its embassy in that country. Since that time, anomalous health incidents have continued to generate media attention in major new outlets, with stories focusing on the national security implications appearing in the New York Times and The New Yorker, among many other publications. Speculation presently focuses on the use of directed energy weapons, or ranged weapons that attack a target with electromagnetic radiation like ultra-high frequency radio waves, as one possible cause for anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAs of 2023, there have been over 200 reported anomalous health incidents, with many of the victims stating they were subject to attacks by directed energy weapons. Given that most of these individuals have been identified as high-ranking officials across multiple federal agencies, any programs that may be investigating anomalous health incidents and/or the effects of directed energy on humans would be the subject of considerable public interest. This is especially important in light of the fact that both Congress and the President approved compensation in the range of $140,000 or $187,000 per person to individuals diagnosed as suffering from anomalous health incidents under the HAVANA Act of 2021.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between the police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nJ.D. Fellow\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nk.stathulis@northeastern.edu\r\n614.551.8426\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMacKenzie Orcutt",

An appellate court decision, SEIU Healthcare 775 NW v. DSHS, 193 Wn. App. 377 (2016) holds that when a city receives a request for documents that includes a list of individuals, the City is required to determine whether the list will be used for \u201ccommercial purposes.\u201d The case concluded that a requestor has a commercial purpose if the requestor intends to use the list for direct or indirect profit-making activity, regardless of whether the requestor intends to contact the individuals on the list or even if the individuals are personally affected by the release of the list or not. If the City has some indication that a requester intends to use a list of individuals for a commercial purpose, we are required to \u201cinvestigate further\u201d before we disclose that list. \r\nFurther, the SEIU case held that even an affirmation stating that any responsive records received for a request which include lists of individuals will not be used for commercial purposes, is not sufficient.\u00a0 Instead, before we can release the records providing the requested information, we are required to obtain from you sufficient details as to what you intend to use the list for so that we can make an independent evaluation as to whether or not your purpose is commercial or not. \r\n\r\nIf you wish to obtain the record referenced above which includes a list of individuals, please fill out and return the Commercial Purpose Declaration which is available by accessing your account through the \"My Request Center\" on the City's public records request portal (GovQA). A determination will then be made as to whether your stated purpose regarding the use of the list(s) of individuals contained in any compiled responsive records is sufficient to allow for the release of this information. To avoid unnecessary delay in obtaining these specific responsive records for your request, please return the completed declaration at your earliest opportunity. We will follow up with you within five business days as to the validity of the stated purpose relating to your request. Upon determination that your completed declaration is valid, we anticipate providing these emails in your next installment. \r\n\r\nPlease provide the completed affidavit as soon as possible, but within 30 days of today\u2019s date, or by October 13, 2023. If we have not heard back from you in this regard by that date, we will be unable to provide you with the record located that include a list of individuals. \r\n\r\nStaff is still in the process of reviewing the records located by Police Department staff. Per section 18 on page 9 of the contract being provided to you via your GovQA account, we are required to notify Forensic Logic LLC. of your public records request and provide them with the opportunity pursuant to RCW 42.56.540 (court protection of public records), to enjoin (stop) the City\u2019s release of the responsive records.

If we have not received a completed and valid commercial purpose declaration from you by that date, we will be unable to release the record located that includes a list of individuals. \r\n\r\nFurther, Staff is still in the process of reviewing the records located by Police Department staff. Per section 18 on page 9 of the contract being provided to you via your GovQA account, we are required to notify Forensic Logic LLC. of your public records request and provide them with the opportunity pursuant to RCW 42.56.540 (court protection of public records), to enjoin (stop) the City\u2019s release of the responsive records. If no court ordered injunction is received from the company by the date prescribed to them, the records will be provided to you. \r\n\r\nWe reasonably anticipate requiring until on or about November 2, 2023, to provide a next installment for your request. We will follow up with you on or about that date regarding the status of your request. If responsive records become available in advance of this estimate, we will let you know. Conversely, if City staff encounters a need to extend our estimate, we will advise accordingly. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSabrina Groves \r\nAdministrative Specialist",

Upload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fspokane-police-department-717%252Farrest-consortium-141189%252F%253Femail%253Dspokanewa%252540govqa.us&url_auth_token=AAAkCQYMGrzer8VxLONpUgOmZfM%3A1qy4z4%3AmAEU1P1PQnJWqKRequ40hStqz1a7z0LQBeC0dOsGMeM \r\n\r\nThis is to advise that a third and final installment of responsive records are available by accessing your account via the My Request Center on the City\u2019s public records request portal (GovQA). \r\n\r\nSome of the information in the provided records has been determined to be exempt from disclosure and that information has been redacted. An exemption log accompanies the records explaining the exempt information and the reasons and statutes relied upon for withholding the information. \r\n\r\nIn accordance with Section 6.5 of the City\u2019s Public Records Request policy, if you wish to appeal a determination to withhold information, you may petition in writing or by email to the City Clerk\u2019s Office for a review of the determination within sixty (60) days of the denial of access.\u00a0 Please include a copy of, or reasonably identify, the part of the response to which you object.\u00a0 Your petition will be forwarded to the Hearing Examiner, who will consider the petition and either affirm or reverse the determination within ten (10) business days following the City\u2019s receipt of the petition, or within such greater period of time as the City and the requestor mutually agree to. You may obtain a court review of the denial of your request pursuant to RCW 42.56.520 at the conclusion of the two business days after the initial denial, regardless of any internal administrative review.\u00a0 The complete Public Records Request Policy may be accessed at the following website: https://my.spokanecity.org/administrative/public-records/.  \r\n\r\nThis request is now concluded and closed. If you feel we have overlooked anything in responding to your request or if we may be of further assistance, please advise. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSabrina Groves \r\nAdministrative Specialist",

        "communication": "Good morning Ms. Best,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIA request you made for records concerning Daniel Bledsoe. As you probably recall, the FBI located approximately 1330 pages that are potentially responsive to your request. Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process. A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.   \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  This may also reduce duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, I would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  We could potentially narrow your request by date, or if you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  We can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-1695, Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am and 3:00pm Eastern time.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFOIA Negotiation Team\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\n540-868-1695\r\n\r\nNeed a status check?

This information includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Name\r\n\r\n\u2022 Service Number\r\n\r\n\u2022 Certificate of Release/Discharge Papers, aka DD form 214\r\n\r\n\u2022 Dates of Service\r\n\r\n\u2022 Branch of Service\r\n\r\n\u2022 Final Duty Status\r\n\r\n\u2022 Final Rank\r\n\r\n\u2022 Salary\r\n\r\n\u2022 Assignments and Geographical Locations\r\n\r\n\u2022 Source of Commission\r\n\r\n\u2022 Military Education Level\r\n\r\n\u2022 Awards and decorations\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian positions\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian titles\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian salaries\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian grades\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian job locations\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the National Personnel Records Center has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nYou will find as an attachment a copy of Mr. West's obituary from the The New York Times, published on January 9, 1999.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Mr. West, per the attached obituary, was a figure of considerable public interest. He worked for the government, both during his time in the USAF and as a civilian contractor, during the Korean War, on research related to the alleged brainwashing of American prisoners-of-war, by Korean, Soviet, and Chinese officials. Mr. West's OMPF and OPF would help provide the public with a better understanding of military and civilian-guided research on this subject during the Korean War.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $250. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

I was curious if this dataset is representative of the 2023 fiscal year (from 7/1/2022 - 6/30/2023) as requested, or if the data provided was an as-of \"snapshot\" based on the report run date? I ask because it appears there are several employees with \"Company Seniority Dates\" and \"Employees State Begin Dates\" beyond the 2023 fiscal year. Can you also clarify which field should be considered the Employee Start Date, and may we also get a list of non-abbreviated \"Companies\"?",

Looking at some specific employees existing in 2022 that do not exist in the 2023 data, it appears that most of those records belong to \"Faculty, University Staff, and Political Jurisdiction Staff\" with record counts of those classifications having the approximate record count of the difference between the two files. \r\n\r\nWould you be able to clarify the effective date of the data (FY 2023 as requested, or a snapshot in time as of the run of the report), as well as the field that could be considered Employee Start Date? Would it be possible to include these records in the 2023 disclosure as they were provided in response to a separate request for 2022 employee compensation data?  If you could a \"key\" between the company abbreviation provided and their non-abbreviated descriptions/names, that would also be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nTyler",

        "communication": "Dear Jenny Wadhwa: \r\nOur office received your open records request pursuant to Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo. Your request has been assigned number P044805-103023.\u00a0The Patrol is committed to adhering to the Sunshine Law and to ensuring that the public obtains access to open records that are not otherwise closed by law. The Sunshine Law requires each public agency to adhere to certain standards. This letter is designed to ensure that you understand our process for fulfilling your records request. Three Business Day Notice Requirement: \r\nThe requested records are not immediately available for dissemination or inspection. The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G.

Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center.
