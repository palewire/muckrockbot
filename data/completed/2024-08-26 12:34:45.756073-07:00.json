Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

At least some of the records I am requesting were previously posted on the Department's website (https://web.archive.org/web/20160530052744/http://labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/wageboard2015.shtm). Although this page has since been removed, I believe that the Department still holds these records. Indeed, I confirmed with the New York State Archives that they have not received any documents relating to the Fast Food Wage Board.\r\n\r\nI ask that you expedite at least the release of the recordings of the 2015 Fast Food Wage Board meetings. Again, these recordings were previously posted on the Department's website, which suggests that they are of considerable interest to the public and do not require any review or redactions by your staff. Your own FOIL guidelines state that the timeline for responding to a request depends on \"the number of documents you request, their format, their availability, the time it takes to redact any information that cannot be disclosed pursuant to FOIL, the time it takes to assemble the documents, and other factors.\" (Quoted from the Process section of https://dol.ny.gov/freedom-information-law-foil-requests). These request-specific factors bely the claim in your extension message that you have an \"obligation to treat each request equally.\" Since the previously public Fast Food Wage Board documents do not need redactions or reformatting, it seems reasonable to expect that you can release them with a minimum of staff time.

The requested records include recordings of\r\npublic hearings and testimony previously available on the DOL website\r\n<https://web.archive.org/web/20160530052744/http://labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/wageboard2015.shtm>.\r\nThe\r\ntracking number for my request is R001184-092523.\r\n\r\nI submitted my request on September 25, 2023 but have yet to receive any\r\nrecords or reasonable estimate of when the records will be available\r\n(again). I was initially given an estimate of 20 business days. A month\r\nlater, the estimate was extended by 90 days. After 90 days, it was pushed\r\nback by 30 days. Most recently, I was given another estimate of 90 business\r\ndays. I have attached the full message history related to this request.\r\n\r\nI do not consider the estimates provided to me reasonable under the\r\ncircumstances of the request. It has been over six months since I submitted\r\nmy request and three estimates have expired with no explanation. Please\r\nnote that no redactions or reformatting should be required for records\r\npreviously released in response to Randy Mastro's 2015 FOIL request or\r\npublished to a public webpage. I kindly ask that you provide me with a\r\nreasonable estimate taking into account the nature of my request and the\r\ntime it took the Department to respond to similar recent requests.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n*Peter Fugiel, PhD* | Postdoctoral Research Fellow\r\n\r\nDepartment of Labor Studies and Employment Relations\r\n\r\nRutgers School of Management and Labor Relations\n",

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPlease be advised that certain student and parent/guardian information was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(j)(iii) exempts from release information concerning a school or university\u2019s adjudication of student disciplinary cases, but only to the extent that disclosure would unavoidably reveal the identity of the student. \r\nSection 7(1)(c) exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

By letter dated June 16, 2020, this Office provided you with an acknowledgement letter where we have assigned your request to the complex track.\r\nI want to assure you that your request FOIA-2020-01225 remains open in this Office. Insomuch as your request is seeking electronic records, it is currently pending a search within our eDiscovery queue. We utilize various tracks within our eDiscovery queue in order to prioritize our searches. Outside of certain specific matters (such as requests that have become the subject of litigation), our search queues are prioritized based on the number of records custodians being searched, as that is a leading factor on how long the eDiscovery search will take to be completed.\r\nYour request currently requires a search of 37 records custodians within the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General. Given our current eDiscovery backlog, our records search is currently estimated to take an additional six months. Again, this estimate is due to the number of eDiscovery requests in our backlog as opposed to any specific issue with the nature of your request. Should you be willing to further limit the number of records custodians, we would move your request to a higher priority search queue. For example, we could limit our records search to the electronic records of the Attorney General and Chief of Staff, which would place your request into one of our highest priority search queues. Again, this is just an example of a possible search alternative.\r\nUnless advised otherwise by you, we will continue our processing with the understanding that you are interested in responsive electronic records, including emails, (to the extent such records exist) and records search accordingly.  Thank you for your patience with this matter.

By email communication on June 11, 2021, this Office estimated six months to complete the search of your request.  We now have access to the records of the custodians of the Offices of the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General; however, we are continuing to review potentially responsive records of the custodians. We will do so utilizing our ediscovery search platform that allows for more dynamic processing of the records once they are located.  Accordingly, I need to extend this estimation for an additional five to six months for this FOIA request.  While I understand the passage of time since this request was submitted, my updated estimate is based on our review of the number of custodians, as opposed to any issue with the nature of your request.  Please note, this estimate is subject to change; however, if we can respond sooner, we will do so. Unless advised otherwise by you, we will continue our records search.  Should you wish to discuss your request scope or have any additional questions or concerns, please contact this Office and we will work with you on your request.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nValeree Villanueva\n-----------------------------------------\r\nValeree Villanueva\r\nSupervisory Government Information Specialist &\r\n  FOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Information Policy\r\nU.S. Department of Justice\r\n202-514-3642",

In my communication sent on February 25, 2022, I estimated the search for FOIA-2021-01225 to be completed in five to six months, as we had received access to custodians' records.  Currently, we are continuing to search for potentially responsive records of the custodians in the Offices of the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General; accordingly, I am extending my estimation for completion of the search to be September 2022.\r\nIn an effort of facilitate our ability to respond to this request, you may want to narrow the parameters of the records search. Some requesters decide to limit their search to certain custodians or narrow the date range. The number of Department custodians subject to the records search and the broadness of the timeframe of the search are two significant factors in how long the records search takes to be completed.\r\nPlease be advised, you are not required to limit custodians or narrow the timeframe, I am only providing options, which might help facilitate our search.  If you would prefer, I will provide the names of the custodians we are searching, and you may decide if there are any officials you do not want searched.  Please let me know if you want this information sent to you.\r\nIf you are no longer interested in emails related to the topic of your request, it would significantly facilitate our ability to provide a response as we could limit our search to the Department Executive Secretariat, which maintains official correspondence on behalf of the Offices of the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General.\r\nOnce searching is completed, we will begin our review of the potentially responsive records, and we can provide an estimated date of completion, including communicating the possibility of any interim responses.\r\nIf you would like to further discuss your request, please feel free to contact our Office to discuss this matter. Thank you for your patience with this matter.\nBest,\r\nValeree Villanueva.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nValeree Villanueva\r\nSupervisory Government Information Specialist &\r\nFOIA Public Liaison\r\nOffice of Information Policy\r\nU.S. Department of Justice\r\n202-514-3642",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for a definitive contract (award ID: HQ003422C0094) awarded to Sancorp Consulting, LLC (UEI: GRYKNJ8BGFC8). This contract has an action date of August 22, 2022, and is funded by the Department of Defense through the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense For Intelligence and Security for support services in the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Correspondence (internal emails, physical mail, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by Sancorp Consulting, LLC\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to work being done by AARO and its contractors. During an April 19, 2023 hearing of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, AARO director Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick stated AARO would need additional authorization from Congress to begin counterintelligence work, but given that Sancorp's contract with AARO started in 2022, prior to that hearing, and Sancorp lists on its website previous work in the field of counterintelligence, there is a possibility AARO may already be engaged in counterintelligence work without Congressional authorization. Sancorp's contract with AARO would help clarify this apparent contradiction.\r\n\r\nThere is no risk of interfering with ongoing operations or disclosure of sensitive materials. Sancorp already lists the contract on their publicly-accessible website: https://www.sancorpconsulting.com/_files/ugd/7aeb19_0c37a59d213b4d68a043ef83b56edc9a.pdf\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Ms. Joo Chung\r\nAssistant to the Secretary of Defense for Privacy\r\nCivil Liberties, and Transparency (PCLT)\r\nOffice of the Secretary of Defense\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn May 21, 2023, I submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552, FOIA case number 23-F-0905, for copies of records for award ID HQ003422C0094. This ID is connected to a contract awarded by Department of Defense through the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense For Intelligence and Security to Sancorp Consulting, LLC (UEI: GRYKNJ8BGFC8) in 2022, for work identified as \u201cAARO SUPPORT SERVICES.\u201d\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\n\r\nOn September 11, 2023, I received a partial response, attached, from Stephanie L. Carr, Chief, Department of Defense (DOD), Freedom of Information Division, stating that the DOD had identified 125 pages of documents responsive to my request, but that it would be releasing only a portion; a file containing 34 pages, labeled 23-F-0905_doc_1.pdf, was attached.\r\n\r\nThe partial response letter also stated: \u201cFinally, Acquisition Directorate conducted an exhaustive search of their records systems for the following: Correspondence (internal emails, physical mail, etc.); Requests for Information; Memorandum(s) of Understanding; Letters of Interest; Task Letters; Privacy Impact Assessments; and, Presentations by Sancorp Consulting, LLC. After thorough searches of their electronic records and files, no records of the subjects were located. In this instance, fees for processing your request were below the threshold for requiring payment. Please note that fees may be assessed on future requests.\u201d\r\n\r\nAPPEAL\r\n\r\nUpon review of the partial response letter, the Acquisition Directorate appears to have overlooked at least one item identified in my original request, which I reproduce in part below:\r\n\r\n\u201c- Correspondence (internal emails, physical mail, etc.)\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n- Award Letters\r\n- Task Letters\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n- Invoices\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n- Presentations by Sancorp Consulting, LLC\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease take note that the Acquisition Directorate\u2019s response jumps from \u201cRequests for Information\u201d to \u201cMemorandums of Understanding.\u201d Missing is an acknowledgement that the Acquisition Directorate did or did not locate records responsive to my request for \u201cStatements of Work\u201d (SOW). Per Acquisition Directorate documents available on the General Services Administration\u2019s website, attached, this item may also be identified as a Performance Work Statement (PWS). Page 4 of a PowerPoint presentation labeled \u201cPWS Writing Tips,\u201d dated April 16, 2014, identifies the SOW and PWS as being synonymous. This information can be found at: https://hallways.cap.gsa.gov/system/files/doclib/april-2015-clemens-pws-presentation-final-1523974380.pdf\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am appealing the partial response because the DOD Acquisition Directorate, in the course of its exhaustive search, could not identify whether it does or does not have an SOW/PWS on record. Given that the Acquisition Directorate has created a separate document identifying best practices for the writing of an SOW/PWS, it should already be familiar with this item and require no additional clarification.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting an additional search for records responsive to my original request. If the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense For Intelligence and Security and the Acquisition Directorate could overlook the SOW/PWS, then it is possible they may have missed other information.\r\n\r\nI am renewing a request for a fee waiver. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to work being completed on behalf of a government agency, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "RECORDS REQUESTED\r\n\r\nI hereby request the following records under the Freedom of Information Act: all records related to Elizabeth Sutherland Mart\u00ednez. \r\n\r\nOTHER NAMES USED:\r\n\r\nMs. Mart\u00ednez sometimes went by \u201cLiz Sutherland,\u201d using her middle name. Her name later evolved to Elizabeth Sutherland Mart\u00ednez and then to Elizabeth \u201cBetita\u201d Mart\u00ednez. Please note that Ms. Mart\u00ednez's last name contains the Spanish-language letter \"\u00ed\" (an \"i\" with an accent mark). When searching for responsive records, please search for \"Mart\u00ednez\" (with the accent mark) and \"Martinez\" (without an accent mark).\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHIC DETAILS AND PROOF OF DEATH\r\n\r\nMs. Mart\u00ednez was born on 12 December 1925, in Washington, D.C. She died on 29 June 2021. Ms. Mart\u00ednez's news obituary from the Washington Post is attached.\r\n\r\nABOUT MS. MARTINEZ\r\n\r\nElizabeth Mart\u00ednez was a leftist activist who worked primarily on Mexican American and feminist issues. \r\n\r\nMs. Mart\u00ednez graduated with honors in 1946 from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. She then moved to New York to work at the United Nations, where she did research on colonialism and its racial implications.\r\n\r\nFrom 1955 to 1957, she was an assistant to Edward Steichen, the noted photographer who was director of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art. She was a book editor at Simon & Schuster from 1958 to 1964 and then spent a year at the Nation magazine as an arts editor.\r\n\r\nShe made the first of several trips to Cuba in 1959, months after the revolution led by Fidel Castro, and also visited other Communist-led countries, including the Soviet Union, China, Hungary and North Vietnam. Her writings about her travels drew the attention of the FBI, and she was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee. \r\n\r\nIn 1960, Ms. Mart\u00ednez joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). She helped edit an illustrated book on civil rights, \u201cThe Movement\u201d (1964), with text by playwright Lorraine Hansberry. During the Freedom Summer of 1964, Ms. Mart\u00ednez went to Mississippi to help register African American voters. She later became the director of the New York office of SNCC and edited \u201cLetters From Mississippi\u201d (1965), a collection of first-person accounts by young civil rights workers.\r\n\r\nIn 1968, Ms. Mart\u00ednez moved to New Mexico. She helped found and edit a bilingual newspaper, El Grito del Norte (The Cry of the North). She established a Marxist collective in Albuquerque and helped lead protest marches for the rights of workers and women. She joined American Indian demonstrators at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973, when they occupied several buildings on the Pine Ridge reservation and were confronted by federal law enforcement officers.\r\n\r\nIn 1976, she published \u201c450 Years of Chicano History in Pictures,\u201d a bilingual book that was widely used in schools.\r\n\r\nAfter settling in the San Francisco Bay Area, Ms. Mart\u00ednez became a key figure in the Democratic Workers Party and edited its newspaper. She ran for California governor in 1982 as the candidate of the Peace and Freedom Party and won 66,000 votes.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks a person's FBI file.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks information that, to my knowledge, is not already in the public domain. Of course, without already knowing what records the Bureau has, I can't say for sure whether those records are already in the public domain or what the public would learn from them; however, because Ms. Mart\u00ednez has recently died, the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Ms. Mart\u00ednez was a public figure. As noted in her obituary in the Washington Post, her writings about her travels in Communist-led countries drew the attention of the FBI, and she was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee. The obituary also notes that she often attracted a coterie of younger activists as she lectured around the country and conducted workshops on understanding racism. Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records available online for free via muckrock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that lets people share the results of their FOIA requests and encourages journalism around them.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Ms. Mart\u00ednez has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released until now. Again, I cannot be 100% sure if factor is satisfied without already knowing what records the Bureau has. However, given that Ms. Mart\u00ednez's Washington Post obituary states that the FBI was interested in investigating her foreign travel, it seems reasonably likely that responsive records will significantly enhance the public's understanding of the FBI's interest in Ms. Mart\u00ednez and her activism.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government's surveillance of its critics. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion: on balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing the transfer or destruction, including (with out limitation) confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of the records.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. I look forward to receiving your response within 20 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

As I explained in my request, the subject of my request was a public figure and prominent political activist, in whose activities the FBI is known to have taken an interest. Responsive records are likely to be of significant interest a broad spectrum of people. Moreover, the public has a significant interest in knowing about how their government surveils and investigates those who loudly criticize it.  For these and the other reasons outlined in my original request, the Bureau should have granted my fee waiver. \r\n\r\nThank you for considering this appeal.\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJames Earl Ray (March 10, 1928 \u2013 April 23, 1998) was an American convicted of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Ray was convicted on his 41st birthday after entering a guilty plea to forgo a jury trial. Had he been found guilty by jury trial, he would have been eligible for the death penalty. He was sentenced to 99 years in prison. He later recanted his confession and tried unsuccessfully to gain access to a retrial. In 1998, Ray died in prison of complications due to chronic hepatitis C infection. His death has been widely reported. http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/24/us/james-earl-ray-70-killer-of-dr-king-dies-in-nashville.html?pagewanted=all\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

If more than 4 hours of employee time is required to search for, compile, segregate, redact or reproduce the records requested, a fee may be charged at an hourly rate equal to or less than the hourly rate attributed to the lowest paid employee who has the necessary skill required to complete the record request, which rate shall not exceed twenty-five dollars ($25) per hour.\r\n\r\nWe will begin the process of calculating this fee. Please note that payment of the fee will be required prior to the completion of the request. If the actual costs are less than the estimated fee, a refund will be issued. If the actual costs are greater than the estimated fee, a revised fee estimate will be issued.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPatrick Stone\r\n\r\n\r\nPatrick Stone\r\nDirector of Strategic Communications and Marketing\r\nCape Cod Community College\r\n774-330-4714\r\npstone@capecod.edu<mailto:pstone@capecod.edu>\r\n\r\n[Image]\r\n\r\n[Image]<https://www.facebook.com/CapeCodCommunityCollege/>[Image]<https://www.instagram.com/capecodcc/> [Image] <https://twitter.com/capecodcomcol>  [Image] <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fTjw_c8yLGB_Zb6WZEqEg>\n",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; those portions have been redacted including personal email addresses, personal cell phone numbers, employee identification numbers, and other highly personal information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Further, portions of records are exempt from release pursuant to Section 7.5(h) of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure \u201cinformation the disclosure of which is exempted under the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act, and records of any lawfully created State or local inspector general\u2019s office that would be exempt if created or obtained by an Executive Inspector General\u2019s office.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7.5(h). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Further, redactions have been applied in accordance with section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m).
