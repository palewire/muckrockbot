Trump\u2019s first administration (January 20, 2017 \u2013 January 20, 2021), focusing on efforts to manage public and media perceptions of the administration:\r\n\r\n1. Internal Communications About Media Strategy\r\n\t\u2022\tEmails, memoranda, or other internal communications between OMB officials and White House staff discussing:\r\n\t\u2022\tMedia strategies to manage public perception of President Trump following controversial statements or actions.\r\n\t\u2022\tInstructions to federal agencies on how to align messaging with Trump\u2019s narrative, including framing him as a victim of \u201cfake news.\u201d\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), emphasizes FOIA\u2019s purpose to inform the public about government operations, particularly those involving media influence and public communication strategies.\r\n\r\n2. Communications with Media Outlets\r\n\t\u2022\tAll communications between OMB staff and representatives of media outlets (e.g., CNN, Fox News, New York Times, etc.), including:\r\n\t\u2022\tGuidance or suggestions regarding how Trump\u2019s public persona should be portrayed.\r\n\t\u2022\tReactions to specific media coverage of Trump or his administration.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 857 F. Supp. 2d 44 (D.D.C. 2012), highlights the public\u2019s right to understand government coordination with external entities, including the media.\r\n\r\n3. Press Interaction Planning\r\n\t\u2022\tRecords related to planning and execution of press interactions after controversial actions or statements, including:\r\n\t\u2022\tTalking points, briefing materials, or Q&A documents prepared for Trump or senior officials to address the press.\r\n\t\u2022\tMedia strategies specifically designed to counteract \u201cfake news\u201d narratives.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: In American Civil Liberties Union v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 628 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2011), the court affirmed FOIA\u2019s role in providing transparency on government strategies that influence public discourse.\r\n\r\n4. Instructions to Federal Agencies\r\n\t\u2022\tCopies of directives, guidance, or policies sent by OMB to federal agencies about aligning public communications with Trump\u2019s media narrative, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\u2022\tFraming Trump as a victim of media bias.\r\n\t\u2022\tStrategies for projecting strength and competence in response to critical media coverage.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), reinforces that records related to public-facing strategies are subject to disclosure under FOIA.\r\n\r\n5. Analysis or Reports on Media Coverage\r\n\t\u2022\tReports, summaries, or internal analyses compiled by OMB about media coverage of Trump and his administration, including assessments of how specific outlets covered controversies or key events.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146 (1989), supports FOIA\u2019s goal of exposing government analysis and efforts to shape public perception.\r\n\r\nRelevance to Public Interest\r\n\r\nThis request is of significant public interest, as the requested records would provide insight into how a sitting administration used government resources to influence media coverage, shape public perception, and project a carefully managed narrative. Public understanding of such efforts is critical to evaluating transparency and accountability in government.\r\n\r\nSegregability of Non-Exempt Portions\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the requested records is deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions, as required by Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). Agencies must provide detailed justifications for withheld information, including an exemption log.\r\n\r\nPreservation of Records\r\n\r\nPlease note your legal obligation to preserve all potentially responsive records. Any destruction of such records without proper justification constitutes a violation of FOIA\u2019s statutory requirements.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request\r\n\r\nAs an independent investigative journalist with Transparency Report, I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). Disclosure of the requested information serves the public interest by significantly enhancing public understanding of government operations during a historic presidency. This request is not for commercial use.\r\n\r\nLegal Basis: Cause of Action v. FTC, 799 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2015), supports the granting of fee waivers for requests that contribute to public understanding of significant governmental actions.\r\n\r\nIf a fee waiver is denied, I agree to pay up to $200 for processing fees and request prior notification if costs exceed this amount.\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\n\r\nI request expedited processing under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E), as this request pertains to an issue of significant and continuing public interest involving government accountability, media influence, and public perception of transparency.\r\n\r\nResponse Format and Timeline\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested records in electronic format where possible. As stipulated by FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days. If any part of this request is unclear, please contact me at Jordan@Lassiter.eu for clarification.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparency Report\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter",
