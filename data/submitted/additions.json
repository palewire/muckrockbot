Specifically, I am requesting the written explanation of the emergency situation and the reason why waiting for the full 72-hour notice period would be impractical or detrimental to the public interest. A list of meeting dates where 72 hour notice was waived is listed below.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Advisory Opinion 13126 states that public bodies are required to document the emergency situation and the need to hold a meeting or provide documents with less than 72 hours notice.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nNew York State Open Meetings Law, specifically section 104(4)(b) which states that \"In the event of an emergency requiring immediate action, a public body may conduct a meeting without notice as long as it publicly states the reason or reasons why such meeting was not practicable to notice as provided in subdivision one of this section.\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the New York State Committee on Open Government has issued several advisory opinions that emphasize the importance of documenting the emergency situation and the need for the meeting. For example, Advisory Opinion 13126 states that \"In order to establish that there was an emergency that warranted dispensing with the 72-hour notice requirement, a written explanation of the emergency should be prepared.\"\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
