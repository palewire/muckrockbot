        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI request access to and copies of all documents, emails, and any other information in the possession of the Governor's Office of New York relating to threats made against Governor Kathy Hochul from her Inauguration on August 24, 2021 to the present. This request includes metadata associated with the records, such as author, date, and time of creation.\r\n\r\nRecent reports have indicated that Governor Hochul has received numerous threats of violence and harm since taking office. As a concerned citizen and advocate for transparency, I request access to any documents, emails, or other information in the possession of the Governor's Office of New York that relate to these threats.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer to the following court cases and legal principles:\r\n\r\nSoucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067 (D.C. Cir. 1971): This case held that the public has a strong interest in obtaining information about government activities, including any threats made against public officials.\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004): This case held that FOIA requires agencies to disclose records unless the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption.\r\n\r\nFOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Pub. L. No. 114-185, 130 Stat. 538 (2016): This law updated and strengthened the Freedom of Information Act, emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in government and requiring agencies to proactively disclose certain records to the public.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in a readable electronic format, such as PDF or Microsoft Word, and include the metadata associated with the records. If any portion of this request is denied or exempt from disclosure, please cite the specific exemption and provide an index of the withheld or redacted records, as required by law. \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that any attempt to withhold or delete responsive documents will be appealed in a court of law. Any such actions may result in legal proceedings to compel the production of the records and any applicable penalties. I also request that any responsive records be provided on a rolling basis, meaning that records should be provided as they become available instead of waiting for all records to be collected before responding to the request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan",
