According to dispatch audio, officers with OPD responded to the scene and pursued a suspect on foot.  At 12:21 (near 1231 51st Ave), they had the suspect in custody.  I am looking for records that indicate the number of officers who responded to this incident, and, if any exist, investigative reports and body camera footage from the officers who responded.  I am also looking for any arrest reports.\r\n\r\nI request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically.\r\n\r\nNews media status and fee waiver:\r\n\r\nAs a reporter for WIRED, I qualify as a news media requester for the purpose of fees. Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees. This request is not primarily in the commercial interest of myself or WIRED. Additionally, please notify me of costs before taking any billable steps.\r\n\r\nSegregability:\r\n\r\nIf you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory exemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to only a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and provide the remainder of the record.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my request, please do not hesitate to e-mail me at dhruv_mehrotra@wired.com. Conde Nast's legal counsel is also copied on this letter. We look forward to a response as quickly as possible under applicable law.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
