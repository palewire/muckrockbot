The issue of droplet spread of airborne diseases is at the very center of current controversy in public policy, because it's at the core of an ongoing worldwide scientific paradigm shift in the field of infectious diseases and bioaerosols.\r\n\r\nI am seeking, in the general sense, copies of discussions, emails, and records, mostly external, but also internal deliberations, regarding this article.\r\n\r\nIn the specific sense, in addition to the aforementioned records, I am seeking the discussions with reporters that contain the phrase and/or typographical variations of the phrase \"The virus is primarily spread via respiratory droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, or through direct contact with a contaminated surface\", but also, any documents/records that are used to support that claim, and any related discussions of formulating that claim as presented to the press.\r\n\r\nGiven this primarily involves copies of direct correspondence with members of the public, I do not expect complete redactions under the deliberative process principle.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The University of Pittsburgh \u2013 of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education (\u201cPitt\u201d) respectfully declines to provide the information requested below as no applicable federal or state open records law requires Pitt to provide you with the information requested.\r\nThe Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7552) is a federal law which provides for the release of documents maintained by federal agencies.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDuring written testimony submitted in a November 15, 2022, and again during a colloquy with Senator Alex Padilla at a hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Inspector General Cuffari maintained OIG launched a \u2018system-wide audit\u2019 of care in ICE detention facilities. Specifically, the written statement of Dr. Cuffari states at page 3: \r\n\r\n\u201cOur inspection did not review the gynecological procedure approval process for detainees at ICDC. Rather, we launched a separate system-wide audit, across all DHS detention facilities, to ascertain the rigor of the approval process for invasive surgical procedures, as well as the propriety of previously approved invasive medical procedures, in light of medical community standards.3\u201d https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/imo/media/doc/Cuffari%20Testimony.pdf\r\n\r\nInspector General Cuffari asserted during his exchange with Senator Padilla on November 15, 2022, that this \u201csystem-wide audit\u201d was ongoing, more than two years after the September 14, 2020, Irwin County Detention Center whistleblower report. \r\n\r\nPlease provide:\r\n(1) a copy of the Opening Memo or other, similar document describing the referral source, purpose, scope, and methodology of this \u201csystem-wide audit\u201d of DHS facilities; \r\n(2) any Report of Investigation this system-wide audit has produced, or Memoranda of Activity it may have generated. \r\n(3) any Contract DHS-OIG entered into or relied upon with outside contractors to assist in or complete this \u201csystem-wide audit\u201d. \r\n(4) any communications between Inspector General Cuffari or his designee and Congress regarding the status of this \u201csystem-wide audit\u201d. \r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request. Allegations of a pattern of unnecessary, nonconsensual, invasive, and potentially sterilizing gynecological procedures at the Irwin County Detention Center were substantiated by an 18-month, bipartisan investigation of the Senate PSI. These allegations and others relating to the ongoing, acute, deadly harms of DHS detention facilities have been the subject of widespread and exceptional media coverage. We therefore seek expedited processing under 6 CFR 5.5(e) and attest to the accuracy of the statements above under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support of our expedited processing request. \r\n\r\nThese are vital records to understand what, if anything, Inspector General Cuffari\u2019s \u201csystem-wide audit\u201d concluded about care and consent for humans locked inside DHS detention facilities. The President sought hundreds of millions of dollars in supplemental detention funding from Congress without bothering to publish, much less consider, the results of this system-wide audit, in an apparent pre-determination of its outcome. Our transparency project and others we advocate alongside to push back against and contextualize the pending emergency supplemental funding request by the Biden Administration has a right to know the status and conclusions of the system-wide audit the Inspector General conducted. Timely resolution of this request is essential to ensuring we receive records in a period when they can be used to influence current policy, including the budget supplement. Untimely resolution restricts our ability to speak and advocate, violating our First Amendment guarantees of the freedom to speak and petition on matters of public concern. Why is this so? Because without transparent, timely access to records of the Inspector General\u2019s system-wide audit, only the government officials asking Congress and the American people for more money possess the potentially derogatory information that might frustrate or prevent their efforts to get it. Only the people currently in possession of government records\u2014in this case, the system-wide audit\u2014that demonstrate DHS is inflicting daily harm and preventable death upon adults and children  in detention will have real-time access to the government records the public needs to understand and accept these harms are happening. \r\n\r\nBy delaying your response to this request, you will be buying time for the system to re-formulate and strengthen itself without meaningful, evidence-based public input. That is not the democracy Congress or the Supreme Court presume to exist when interpreting the Freedom of Information Act. That is governance by secrecy under a presumption of opacity. \r\n\r\nPlease grant expedited processing to this request and release these materials as soon as practicable. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo Robbie Goldstein, MD, PhD, Commissioner, Department of Public Health\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, MA G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10(a, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am formally requesting records from the MA Department of Public Health, for any documentation of expert and/or public comment or complaints regarding health and safety concerns pertaining to 'smart meters' or \"advanced metering functionality,\" dating from January 2014 to present.\r\n\r\nPlease note it is my understanding that rulings have stated that text messages count as public records as do emails sent on personal email accounts to conduct work-related business.\r\n\r\nORDER 12-76 and Feb 2014 Panel Hearings:\r\n\r\nFor reference, in late February of 2014, the MA DPU held panel hearings regarding comments received in response to \"D.P.U. 12-76-A December 23, 2013, Investigation by the Department of Public Utilities on its own Motion into Modernization of the Electric Grid,\" issued by Chair Berwick. https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/9254075\r\n\r\nPeter Valberg of Gradient testified in person before the DPU for the panel hearings in Feb. 0f 2014, but no written testimony by Valberg was posted publicly.\r\n\r\nThe DPU received commentary and complaints from both health experts and from the public that the agency was relying on testimony, public relations, and marketing claims from a compromised, pro-industry, mercenary product defense expert, Peter Valberg of Gradient, who also works for the tobacco industry.\r\n\r\nORDER 12-76-B: June 2014\r\n\r\nFollowing the February hearings, on June 12 of 2014, the DPU issued order 12-76-B, https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/9241637 in which it discounted health concerns, referencing \"Gradient,\" and \"another commenter\" but not identifying Peter Valberg as the source.\r\n\r\nThe public record demonstrates that instead of consulting independent experts with health expertise and liability, the DPU promoted the opinion of Peter Valberg of Gradient Corporation, who did not file any written testimony. Therefore, the source of some claims included in MA 12-762-B discounting smart meter health and safety issues is unclear.\r\n\r\nThe MA DPU smart meter order 12-76-B made the unprecedented claim that exposure guidelines are adequate to protect against both thermal and non-thermal impacts of radio frequency exposure. The circumstances surrounding how that gross misrepresentation was incorporated in the MA DPU order, which then could be referenced in other proceedings, have not been addressed. https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/12907846\r\n\r\n2023 Pending Smart Meter Deployment by Investor-Owned Utilities:\r\n\r\nMA investor-owned utilities have been authorized by the MA DPU to deploy smart meters in their service territories. At the same time, health harm and disability has been reported in other jurisdictions where the meters were installed, including California, now extending for over a decade.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this FOIA request is:\r\n\r\n1. to determine whether or not the MA DPU is basing its health and safety justification for this investment decision by ratepayers on the 2014 testimony, or whether the DPU has revisited and/or monitored developments in RF/EMF research, including the court ruling requiring the FCC to justify why it has not revisited its 1996 exposure guidelines. Note that documented smart meter injuries were included in evidence submitted to the court. Testimony submitted to the DPU for https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/12907846 and https://fileservice.eea.comacloud.net/FileService.Api/file/FileRoom/12639808 outlines this issue.\r\n\r\n2. to determine if potential smart meter vendors or utilities have disclosed the incidence of adverse health effects to the MA DPU, including the acute onset of electrical sensitivity and/or if the MA DPU has accounted for the consequences to vulnerable ratepayers in its business case.\r\n\r\n3. to determine if the DPU's plan for utilities to offer an 'opt out' is based on accurate assumptions, and whether or not it will adequately protect all ratepayers\r\n\r\n4. to determine what correspondence/if any, took place between the Dept of Health and the DPU regarding the safety of wireless smart utility meters and health, including complaints reported during the Worcester National Grid smart meter pilot program which was financed by ratepayers, which utilized Itron meters in a mesh network.\r\n\r\n5. to determine whether or not the MA Dept of Health was aware of or concurs with claims made in the 2014 order DPU 12-76-B, including the implication that FCC limits are protective of non-thermal effects of RF exposures, or if the MA Dept of Health concurs with the implication that the plan to deploy smart meters in MA is safe.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the DPU's mission statement notes that it seeks to promote safety, security, reliability of service, affordability, equity, and greenhouse gas emission reductions. https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-public-utilities\r\n\r\nThe Department of Public Health states that, \"DPH keeps people healthy and communities strong.\" https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-public-health\r\n\r\nFees\r\n\r\nI request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and made in the process of news gathering, and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
