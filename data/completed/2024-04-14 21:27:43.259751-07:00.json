The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within \"unusual circumstances.\"\u00a0 See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\u00a0 Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.\u00a0 We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.\u00a0 The time needed to process your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.\u00a0 For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:\u00a0 simple, complex, or expedited.\u00a0 Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.\u00a0 Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.\u00a0 At this time, your request has been assigned to the complex track.\u00a0 You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. We regret the necessity of this delay, but please be assured that your request will be processed as soon as possible.\u00a0 If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact FOIA/PA Unit representative Fantasia L. Hogan-Bassey-Graham at (571) 776-2210 or via e-mail at Fantasia.L.Hogan-Bassey-Graham@dea.gov, our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300, or e-mail your correspondence to DEA.FOIA@dea.gov. In addition, you may wish to visit our website at www.dea.gov to determine if the information you are requesting is already available to the public.\u00a0 You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at (571) 776-2300 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.\u00a0 Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.\u00a0 The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at (202) 741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at (202) 741-5769.

        "communication": "Dear William Fernandes:\r\n\u200b\r\n            This e-mail responds to your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) request dated April 2, 2022, received by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), FOIA/PA Unit, seeking access to DEA records.  Your request has been opened and assigned the following case number: 23-00303-F.  Please include this case number when communicating with this office.\r\n\r\nYour request as written does not meet the requirements of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (a)(3)(A), since they do not reasonably describe records.  The Department of Justice rules, contained at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.3, provide that \u201cyou must describe the records in enough detail to enable department personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort\u201d and when possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought such as the date, title or name, author and subject matter of the record.  These specifics are important to determine the extent and scope of the search, and to determine the records that are responsive.  DEA can make certain presumptions to overcome some of the deficiencies in your request, but not all of them.\r\n\r\nTo retrieve the information that you may be seeking requires more specificity.  Under the FOIA, an agency is not required to conduct research.  DEA maintains several types of records and records systems (i.e., regulatory, personnel, investigative, etc.).  For example, in your letter, you are requesting Any and all expense records for travel into the State of Nevada for the period 2020.,\u201d yet you have not specified a particular DEA office that you wish searched; or the type of record that would be responsive to your request.  Be advised that DEA has 239 Domestic Offices in 23 Divisions throughout the United States, and 92 foreign offices in 69 countries, and more than 150 Headquarters Offices.  Since your description did not limit the search to a specific office or area, a vast majority of DEA offices would be tasked to conduct a search of their respective offices for any responsive records pertaining to the subject of your request.  As such, your request is overly broad and burdensome.\r\n\r\nPlease specify the following:\r\n\r\n  1.  Clarify the type of travel (TDY and/or Extended TDY travel)\r\n  2.  Verify the timeframe for \u201c2020\u201d (calendar year Jan-December or fiscal year Oct 2019 \u2013 Sept 2020)\r\n  3.  Do you also want the information to include the PCS travel when core employees move?\r\n\r\nTo this end, no further action will be initiated on this request until we are in receipt of the above documentation.  Upon receipt, we will conduct a query of the Investigative Reporting and Filing System (IRFS).  IRFS is the system of records that contains all administrative, general and investigative files compiled by DEA for law enforcement purposes.  If this office does not receive your response within 30 business days, DEA will assume that you do not wish to pursue this matter and your request will be administratively closed.  Please e-mail your response to fantasia.l.hogan-bassey-graham@dea.gov<mailto:fantasia.l.hogan-bassey-graham@dea.gov>.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with DEA\u2019s determination in response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website:  https://www.justice.gov/oip/submit-and-track-request-or-appeal.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request.  If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal.\"\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this email, you may contact our FOIA Requester Service Center at (571) 776-2300.

The FBI and OIG both made FOIA productions about their spending for travel into the Silver State of Nevada.  The DEA offices continues to refuse to produce records in relation to spending and this was during the COVID peak.  \r\n\r\nAt this time the DEA was pandering to other law enforcement agencies (in CA) offering assistance to locate people, which is an advertisement that it did not have enough of its own work to do.  \r\n\r\nThe DOJ OIP refuses to govern the DEA about this which generally is a corruption indicator. Something in the expenses to be inspected. \r\n\r\nI also requested the OIP Background report, which the agency DEA obstructed and only, sent back a portion which was the appeal submitted.\r\n\r\nI think this agency should be defunded and its duties passed to DHS, CBO, FBI, HHS. \r\n\r\nRecords are available publicly here:\r\nhttps://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/expenses-127054/\r\n",

Please reference the number listed above if you have any questions regarding your FOIA response.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this communication is to inform you that the Village is requesting additional time to comply with your request. The Village would like to request an additional five (5) business days for a limited number of reasons: 5 ILCS 140/3(e)(ii), (iii), (v), and (vi), and anticipates that it will respond to your requests by no later than the end of the business day on April 11, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe public body asserts the following facts in support of the above reasons for an extension of time: the request requires the collection of a substantial number of specified records, is couched in categorical terms, the records must be reviewed by personnel to determine if they are exempt from disclosure, and the Village cannot undertake these efforts within the initial time constraints without unduly burdening or interfering with our operations.\r\n\r\nPlease consider our request for additional time as we continue to apply our resources and efforts to fulfill your request.

        "communication": "Dear Michael,\r\n\r\nYour registration with Village of Fox Lake Secure Messaging was completed successfully. Now that you've registered with Village of Fox Lake Secure Messaging, communicating securely is easy!\r\n\r\nAs you know, Village of Fox Lake Secure Messaging protects our confidential correspondences by using the same security technologies as internet banking when sending and receiving sensitive email messages. But you likely didn't know that this service allows you to do so much more than address security and compliance, or guarantee delivery of messages that prevent statements such as \"I never received it\".\r\n\r\nVillage of Fox Lake Secure Messaging includes a patented Delivery Slip - a powerful tool for users that provides many features for increased efficiencies and control over sensitive messages and attachments. It is found on the right side of  all secure message, both in this Secure Message Center and your desktop Microsoft Outlook program ('Enable with MS Office Outlook').\r\n\r\n5 things you can do with the Delivery Slip\r\n\r\nHere's just 5 things you can do with the Delivery Slip that you probably never thought possible with basic email:\r\n\r\n1. Know what happens to your secure message once it's sent. Track and prove when a secure message and attachment is received, read, replied to, forwarded, deleted or printed.\r\n\r\n2. Send jumbo files via email. Now you can simply attach that 100 MB file to a message without having to find an external service to share it.\r\n\r\n3. Completely recall a secure message - and it works! Now you can instantly retract a secure message and attachment - even days or weeks after the recipient has read the message - resulting in the recipient's inability to access or read the recalled secure message.\r\n\r\n4. Prevent a recipient from forwarding or replying to a secure message; or prevent a recipient from printing or saving a message or attachment.\r\n\r\n5. Add extra security for ultra-sensitive content with 'For Your Eyes Only' by including an additional password required for the message or attachment to be opened by the recipient. Also prevents internal or external access by email delegates.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the benefits of  Village of Fox Lake Secure Messaging unique features: http://www.appriver.com/\r\n\r\nThank you, and we're glad to have you as part of Village of Fox Lake Secure Messaging!\r\n\r\n_________________\r\n--------------- BEGIN E-MAIL2 SIGNATURE ---------------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\r\n\r\n--------------- END E-MAIL2 SIGNATURE ---------------",

Utah Code 63G-2-201(7) specifies that our agency is not required to create a record or tailor data or information in respond to a records request. However, acknowledging the public interest in the matter of treatment of transgender individuals in the context of the criminal justice/correctional system, we are providing you with some information as a onetime courtesy. \r\n\r\nThe Utah Department of Corrections (UDC) Research and Planning team has provided me with the following information to pass on to you: \r\n\r\n-There are 4 female gender assigned at birth offenders and all 4 females identify as male\r\n-There are 30 male gender assigned at birth offenders and all 30 of these males identify as female\r\n-There are only 2 offenders that have requested housing with the gender they identify as. None have been granted as all housing is assigned based on the sex assigned at birth. The Utah State Legislature recently passed a bill addressing the matter of housing assignments for transgender inmates. Please see HB316 (2024). \r\n\r\nAttached to this message is a table showing race and holding offense. For any further questions, we encourage you to reach out to the UDC public information office: https://corrections.utah.gov/media-information/\r\n\r\nIf you wish to dispute our fulfillment of your records request, you have the right to appeal this decision to the Utah Department of Corrections\u2019 Deputy Director.  To submit a proper appeal, you must file a Notice of Appeal with the Deputy Director within 30 days of the date of this denial.  The Notice of Appeal must contain your name and a copy of, or the original request, which was denied.  It must also include a statement of the relief you seek (explain what you want the Deputy Director to do).  You may also submit a short statement of facts, reasons and legal authority in support of your request for these records.  Please include a mention of the reference number that was assigned to this GRAMA request. \r\n\u200b\r\nTo appeal this request please reply to this message with your appeal. Please also feel free to upload any relevant documents to your appeal to this request. Once we receive your appeal, this request will be reopened while the Deputy Director deliberates.  You may also send your appeal through postal mail to: \r\n\u200b\r\nJared Garcia\r\nDeputy Director\r\nUtah Department of Corrections\r\n14717 South Minuteman Drive\r\nDraper, UT  84020\r\n\r\nIn addition, please be aware that records requests can also be made on the UDC website at: https://corrections.utah.gov/records-requests/\r\n\r\nPlease reach out if you have any questions or concerns. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nTavin Forsythe-Barker\r\nGRAMA Records Officer\r\nUtah Department of Corrections",

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.  I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Charles Grandison \"Charlie\" Rose III (August 10, 1939 \u2013 September 3, 2012), who was a Democratic United States Congressman from North Carolina who served from 1973 to 1997. Proof of death is not required as his death has been widely and extensively reported by the mainstream media, including the New York Times on September 4, 2012. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/us/politics/charlie-rose-us-representative-dies-at-73.html Further, his death is reflected in the FBI's Dead List.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the ELSUR Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records (as the Bureau has posted copies of records that it previously said were transferred to NARA such as the Tokyo Rose file).\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. Per DOJ FOIA guidance, \"a requester should be granted a fee waiver if the requested information (1) sheds light on the activities and operations of the government; (2) is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations and activities; and (3) is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\" As this FOIA meets all of those requirements (see above), a fee waiver is warranted.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing the organization known as the Knights of\r\n    Columbus, a global Catholic fraternal service organization.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the\r\n    request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM\r\n    if not.\r\n    \r\n    Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nOur records reflect no posted payment associated with 1334485-001; rather, your request was reopened on 11-20-2015 upon receipt of your cost letter response reflecting commitment to pay the estimated fees.  No fees have been formally assessed related to this request to date.\r\n\r\nAs indicated on our Status Update website, http://vault.fbi.gov under the \u201cCheck Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u201d link, your request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.  Please continue to check the status of your request using the provided website, as statuses are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request large processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is March 2018.\r\n\r\nOur records reflect in April 2016, the negotiation analyst made two attempts to contact you regarding the option to potentially reduce the scope of your request in an effort to receive the records more quickly; no response was received at the time.

Reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request to place it in a smaller, potentially faster processing track?\r\nPlease let us know if this is something you would be interested in further discussing.

        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Manning,\r\n\r\nWe are processing your request for \"[a]ny FOIA requests to the SEC responded during the month of August 2022, and the responsive documents.\" This request was assigned tracking number 22-02910-FOIA.\r\n\r\nWe need to request clarification of your request in order to identify the information of most interest to you. Are you interested in the response letters for just those requests where records were provided?\r\n\r\nWe respond to a high volume of FOIA requests where there is no information found and no records are provided to the requester. We receive between 10,000-13,000 requests per year, so our volume of outgoing final response letters for a single month may be 1,000 letters or more, including only interim and final response letters (not including acknowledgement letters, other types of administrative letters, emails, etc.). Further, these letters are only stored in each individual request file and would require an extensive manual search.\r\n\r\nDepending on the information you are seeking, it might be possible to arrange for an alternative to the letters, such as a list of all requests that were closed during the time period of your request where records were provided.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know at your earliest convenience how you would like you proceed. We will place your request on hold until we hear back, and we would request that you please respond by Wednesday, November 2. We will be happy to work with you to determine the best way to provide the information you are seeking.\r\n\nThank you,\r\nCarrie Hyde-Michaels\r\nFOIA Branch Chief\r\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\r\nOffice of FOIA Services\r\nhyde-michaelsc@sec.gov<mailto:hyde-michaelsc@sec.gov>\r\nDirect: (202) 551-5816",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 104 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 853 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,786 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,500 days for processing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

A list is available on Wikipedia, though I expect your office may not need that assistance. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_United_States_Space_Force\r\n\r\nI also request that all files be released a vector file format like SVG or EPS. This should not require the agency to create a new record. This type of file format is how the logo must have been initially created by or for the government. An appeal decision in a previous FOIA case has concluded that these records are in the public domain and must be released. The appeal case number with the National Reconnaissance Office was F-2019-00113. You can read the decision at https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/nrol-39-mission-logo-78740/#file-817847\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Welsh",

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. The law states, Section 24-72-205 (5) (a), C.R.S., (a) A custodian may charge a fee not to exceed twenty-five cents per standard page for a copy of a public record or a fee not to exceed the actual cost of providing a copy, printout, or photograph of a public record in a format other than a standard page; except that a custodian shall not charge a per-page fee for providing records in a digital or electronic format. \r\n2. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff. Please provide a quantitative list of the time involved and the staff who performed the tasks.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Gov't Code, which provides that an e-mail address of a member of the public that is provided for the purpose of communicating electronically with a governmental body is confidential and not subject to disclosure.  Additional redactions have been made per The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), where a student's identifying information appears within the records.\r\n\r\nSection 552.275 of the Texas Government Code authorizes a governmental body to establish a reasonable limit, not less than 15 hours for a one month period or 36 hours in a 12 month period, on the amount of time that personnel are required to spend producing public information for inspection or copies to a requestor, without recovering the costs attributable to the personnel time related to that requestor. Section 552.275 does not replace or supersede other sections, and it does not preclude a governmental body from charging labor for a request for inspection or copies for which a charge is authorized under other sections of this law.\r\n\r\nKeller ISD has established 15 hours in a one-month period and 36 hours per 12-month period as the reasonable limit on the amount of time personnel are required to spend producing public information for inspection or copies without recovering attributable costs. This 12-month period coincides with the District's fiscal year, which begins on July 1. Requestors who exceed the 36-hour time limit in a fiscal year (or 15 hours in one month) shall pay all costs attributable to cost of materials, personnel time, and overhead expenses necessary to comply with the request, even if the requestor intends to only inspect the documents.  For the 2023-2024 fiscal year thus far, the District has spent 1.0 hour(s) responding to requests you have submitted to date (since July 1, 2023) and provided you with the records gathered and compiled as a result.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the District's response to the March 13, 2024 request.\r\n\nThank you,\r\nKeller ISD Public Records\r\nP: 817-744-1000 | F: 817-744-1263\r\nwww.kellerisd.net<http://www.kellerisd.net/>",

        "communication": "To whom it may concern,\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (CPRA) by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) for records related to the Fontana Police Department\u2019s purchase, usage, and policies regarding cellular communications interception technology (CCIT) and cell site simulators (CSS).\r\n\r\nOn March 14, 2023, the Fontana City Council approved the purchase of the Jacobs Technology Inc. Rapid Solutions system, which included the purchase and installation of a Base Station System for $920,098.94. The Rapid Solutions system qualifies as a CCIT and CSS. This purchase follows the acquisition of the Keyw CCIT/CSS systems; Keyw was acquired by Jacobs in 2019.\r\n\r\n1. Fontana Police Department's CCIT/CSS usage and privacy policy regarding the collection, use, maintenance, data retention, sharing, and dissemination of information, including all directives, bulletins, memoranda and related guidance;\r\n2. All memoranda of understanding or other agreements with other local agencies or any other party for the shared use of CCIT/CSS or the sharing of information collected through its use;\r\n3. All policies, guidance, training materials or other documents regarding the use of CCIT/CSS and compliance with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (CalECPA); \r\n4. All disclosures to the California Department of Justice regarding CCIT/CSS use as required by CalECPA; \r\n5. All emails, documents, user manuals, marketing materials, presentations and other documentation describing the following Jacobs products: \r\n    a. Base Station NG;\r\n    b. Trachea2+;\r\n    c. Jugular4+;\r\n    d. Light Embedded Software System;\r\n6. All CCIT/CSS deployment logs from April 1, 2023 through March 19, 2024;\r\n7. All search warrants filed in relation to the use of CCIT/CSS from the period April 1, 2023 through March 19, 2024. \r\n\r\nIn addition we request the following information and assistance, as required under CPRA: \r\n* Assistance in identifying additional records and information that describes Fontana\u2019s usage, acquisition of, and policies related to CCIT and CSS;\r\n* A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist; and\r\n* Suggestion for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records and information sought. \r\n\r\nThe CPRA also requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available.\r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at this email address. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nWill Greenberg\r\nStaff Technologist\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Be advised, City of Chicago Employee email addresses, hospital names and personal telephone numbers have been redacted from the attached records pursuant to 7(1)(b) of FOIA, which provides that public bodies may redact information that is considered private. \u00a05 ILCS 2(c-5) of FOIA defines private information as follows: \"Private information\" means unique identifiers, including a person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers and email addresses. \u00a0Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any person. Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would\u00a0constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \"Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" means the disclosure of information that is\u00a0highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. To the extent a portion of your FOIA request has been denied, you have a right of review by the Illinois Attorney General's Public Access Counselor who can be contacted at 500 S. Second St., Springfield, IL 62706 or by telephone at (877)-299-FOIA. Email: public.access@ilag.gov. You may also seek\u00a0judicial review of a denial under 5 ILCS 140/11 of FOIA. Sincerely, M.

Brown,\r\n\r\nI am writing in response to your Freedom of Information Act request of June\r\n11, 2018, for records in the custody of the National Archives and Records\r\nAdministration. Your request was received in this office on June 12 and\r\nassigned FOIA case number RD 57472.\r\n\r\nYou requested access to case file number 77-HQ-138223, identified by the\r\nFBI as potentially responsive to your request for records relating to\r\nStephen Reinhardt. My initial assessment confirms that Stephen Reinhardt is\r\nin fact the subject of this file. The file is arranged in three sections,\r\nwith two EBFs (Enclosures Behind File) for serials 44 and 75.\r\n\r\nWe reviewed EBF 75, which consists of approximately 300 pages of Senate\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary deposition transcripts of Joseph Hauser and SA\r\nWilliam Fleming, from June-July 1980, and released the EBF in full. You or\r\nyour representative may now view EBF 75 at the National Archives facility\r\nin College Park, Maryland. Please contact Jessica Hartman at least one week\r\nin advance of your visit at  specialaccess_foia@nara.gov to arrange to see\r\nthe records. If you cannot visit our College Park facility, you may order a\r\nreproduction copy at the cost of $.80 per page. Please contact Ms. Hartman\r\nto place an order.\r\n\r\n77-HQ-138223 Sections 1-3 and EBF 44 consist of approximately 500 pages,\r\ncompiled as part of an internal security investigation conducted between\r\nJune 1979 and October 1980. These portions of the file require further\r\nscreening for categories of information exempted from disclosure under the\r\nterms of the Freedom of Information Act, prior to public release. In\r\nparticular, there are documents that may be redacted to protect the\r\nidentities of confidential sources, including FBI informant codes and\r\ninformant file numbers.\r\n\r\nRequests for FBI case files that do not exceed 500 pages are assigned to\r\nour first-tier processing queue. Taking into consideration our existing\r\nbacklog, the estimated time required to complete the processing of your\r\nrequest is approximately 24 months from the date of this letter.\r\n\r\nTo notify this office of a change in your contact information or to track\r\nthe status of your request, please telephone 301-837-3190 <(301)%20837-3190>\r\nor e-mail specialaccess_foia@nara.gov.

Staffing levels on-site have been severely limited with\r\nlong periods where our facility was closed. Even as we expand our\r\nreopening, operations may be temporarily curtailed due to limited staffing\r\nand/or deteriorating local health conditions.\r\n\r\nOur small staff has and will continue to work diligently to process each\r\nrequest as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease note, we will not respond to status update requests more than once\r\nevery six months.\r\n\r\nTo notify this office of a change in your contact information or to track\r\nthe status of your request, please telephone 301-837-3190 or e-mail\r\nspecialaccess_foia@nara.gov.
