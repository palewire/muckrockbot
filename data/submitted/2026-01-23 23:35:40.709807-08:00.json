This is a free feature of Flock. This is not an add-on or analytics subscription.\r\n\r\n5) Lastly, I request all available audit data from the \"Flock\" audit tools. This should include the organization audit, network audit, and sharing report.\r\n    A. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\n    The report should include data logged from the period of installation to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done by the City.\r\n\r\n    B. Network Audit in Flock.\r\n    The report should include data logged from the period of installation, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the City\u2019s Flock network by any agency the City has shared with in the Flock System.\r\n\r\n    C. Sharing report in Flock.\r\n    The report should include flock networks shared with The City and networks The City is sharing its network with.\r\n\r\nFlock maintains documentation on these reports. Flock documentation says the reports can be pulled in 31 day increments.  Flock also says that customers may want to contact support for requests longer than six months or for large accounts. If production of audit logs requires support from Flock, please declare such needs and have the City's point person on the Flock support ticket provide updates on their progress.  Please note that license plate numbers are public information or it would be unsafe to display them. Drivers would also be able to hide their plates in their trunk if they were meant to be private.  Officer usernames are similarly publicly available by many resources, such as news reports, court cases, case notes, and reports.\r\n\r\nI request that files be supplied in their original electronic, machine readable format rather than being converted to any alternate formats. Where multiple formats are available for export, I request csv, xls, or other spreadsheet compatible formats.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Specifically, I am requesting: \r\n- Documentation of the amount of funds the city has received from the federal opioid lawsuit settlements\r\n- The application forms that any organization would submit to receive settlement funds\r\n- Documentation of how much city-level funding has been awarded as of March 1, 2025, and to whom it was awarded\r\n- Any completed application of an organization that has received settlement funds from the city\r\n- Documentation of the process by which funds are awarded\r\n- Any documents that contain the names of the individuals who review the funding applications and determine the awards\r\n- Any documents that account for future plans from the city for the use of opioid settlement funds\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $25. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how the opioid settlement funds are being spent.

Specifically, I am requesting: \r\n- Documentation of the amount of funds the city has received from the federal opioid lawsuit settlements\r\n- The application forms that any organization would submit to receive settlement funds\r\n- Documentation of how much city-level funding has been awarded as of March 1, 2025, and to whom it was awarded\r\n- Any completed application of an organization that has received settlement funds from the city\r\n- Documentation of the process by which funds are awarded\r\n- Any documents that contain the names of the individuals who review the funding applications and determine the awards\r\n- Any documents that account for future plans from the city for the use of opioid settlement funds\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $25. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how the opioid settlement funds are being spent. I am a student journalist whose request is strictly for news-gathering purposes. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. \r\nThe West Virginia Freedom of Information Act requires a response to this request be made within five business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records. \r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. \r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request. \r\nSincerely, Drew Solt\r\n740-243-6793\r\ndrewsolt@yahoo.com",

The date of receipt is\r\nJanuary 22, 2026.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the Office of Privacy, Security, and Contracts\r\n(OPSC) will coordinate your request.  The following steps are customarily\r\nassociated with the processing of a public records request. The process may\r\nvary depending on the nature and availability of the information requested:\r\n\r\n   1. Pursuant to Wyoming law, the OPSC sends an acknowledgment to the\r\n   requestor upon receipt of the public records request.\r\n   2. The OPSC identifies the relevant WDH division, program, or facility\r\n   to process the request and asks it to provide an estimate of the labor,\r\n   copies, and other reasonable cost-based fees required to process the\r\n   request.\r\n   3. The OPSC, upon receiving the estimate from the WDH division, program,\r\n   or facility, sends the cost estimate to the requestor. At this point, the\r\n   requestor can choose to modify the request, cancel the request, or agree to\r\n   pay the fees associated with the request.\r\n   4. Upon receiving the requestor's payment, the OPSC notifies the WDH\r\n   division, program, or facility to process and provide the records to the\r\n   OPSC.\r\n   5. The OPSC, upon receiving the records, will provide the requestor with\r\n   these records, if available.\r\n\r\nThe WDH strives to process public records requests as efficiently and\r\nexpeditiously as possible. Every effort will be made to respond to the\r\nrequesting party within thirty (30) days.\r\n\r\nThe WDH may request clarification if your request is unclear. If the\r\nrequested records are releasable, the next correspondence you will receive\r\nfrom the WDH will be either a cost estimate letter seeking your agreement\r\nto the costs associated with processing the request or, if your request is\r\nminimal, the records themselves. If the requested records are *not* releasable\r\n(i.e., the WDH does not have the requested records or cannot release the\r\nrequested records), it will provide you with notice of such denial.\r\n\r\nThank you.\n-- \r\n*Office of Privacy, Security, and Contracts*\r\nWyoming Department of Health\r\n401 Hathaway Building\r\nCheyenne, WY 82002\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nE-Mail to and from me, in connection with the transaction \r\nof public \r\nbusiness, is subject to the Wyoming Public Records \r\nAct and may be \r\ndisclosed to third parties.",

The documents referenced in the\r\nOctober 24, 2025, email titled \"Wyoming curriculum review\" are also being\r\nwithheld for these reasons. In the spirit of transparency, I have included\r\nthe WyPREP Cover Letter and two emails with HHS regarding our submission of\r\nthe curricula for review.\r\n\r\nA new request will need to be submitted to obtain a copy of the final\r\ncurriculum after it has received approval. We do not have an estimate of\r\nwhen we will receive that approval.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any additional questions.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nLindsay Mills\n-- \r\n*Office of Privacy, Security, and Contracts*\r\nWyoming Department of Health\r\n401 Hathaway Building\r\nCheyenne, WY 82002\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nE-Mail to and from me, in connection with the transaction \r\nof public \r\nbusiness, is subject to the Wyoming Public Records \r\nAct and may be \r\ndisclosed to third parties.",
