According to reports, during this incident, Officer McWilliams was overpowered by a suspect who seized the officer\u2019s firearm and discharged one round, grazing Officer McWilliams. A passing bystander, an unidentified 34-year-old man, intervened and assisted in subduing the suspect until backup officers arrived. Police body camera footage reportedly shows the bystander tackling the assailant from behind at a critical moment.

Bloodworth, 24, crashed her Tesla on her father\u2019s private island while allegedly driving under the influence. Responding Monroe County deputies encountered her inside the wrecked vehicle, where she initially refused to exit, claiming, \u201cMy father owns this island!\u201d Upon being removed, she resisted arrest, kicked and screamed, and was recorded on bodycam crying, \u201cI need my dad here!\u201d Deputies later used an airboat to recover evidence, including open vodka bottles. She was arrested and charged with DUI, resisting arrest, and fleeing law enforcement.\r\n\r\nI am requesting the following records related to this incident:\r\n\r\nAll available body-worn camera footage from all deputies involved in the response, arrest, and transportation of Stephanie Bloodworth, specifically between 9:00 PM and 9:30 PM\r\nAll available dashboard camera dashcam footage from all responding patrol vehicles present at the scene\r\nAll 911 call recordings and dispatch logs related to this incident, including radio communications and CAD reports\r\nThe complete incident and arrest reports, including all officer narratives, supplemental reports, and use-of-force documentation\r\nThe full DUI report, blood alcohol test results, and any toxicology findings associated with this case\r\nAll booking documents, jail intake records, and any recorded statements made by Stephanie Bloodworth following her arrest\r\nAll photographs taken by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office MCSO during or after the arrest, including images of the suspect, the crashed Tesla, the crash site, and recovered evidence such as open vodka bottles\r\nAny video footage from airboat operations or any surveillance footage that may have captured the crash, response, or evidence recovery\r\nAny internal reviews or reports related to this incident, including documents regarding the use of an airboat for evidence retrieval\r\nAny press releases, social media posts, or official statements made by the Monroe County Sheriff\u2019s Office regarding this incident\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this request is to serve the public interest by making these records publicly accessible. While I acknowledge that I may also generate revenue from the dissemination of these materials, the request primarily serves to enhance transparency regarding this law enforcement incident.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees associated with fulfilling this request, as disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding of law enforcement practices and actions. However, if a full fee waiver is not possible, please inform me of the estimated costs in advance. Additionally, if fees can be reduced or eliminated by excluding certain records, please specify which records those would be.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records in an electronic format if available. If any portions of this request are denied, please cite the specific legal exemption(s) and provide a redacted version of the document where applicable.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

During an eviction enforcement action, Woods arrived at the scene towing multiple active beehives and, while dressed in a beekeeper suit, deliberately shook and smashed the hives, releasing swarms of aggressive bees onto law enforcement officers. Several deputies sustained bee stings, and at least one required hospitalization due to an allergic reaction.
