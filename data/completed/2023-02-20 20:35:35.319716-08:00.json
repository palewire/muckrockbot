        "communication": "Dear Records Custodian,\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (MCL 15.231 et. seq.) for documents that detail how your community\u2019s water system functions, including details on utility terminations, restorations, and rates.\r\n\r\nAs context for this request, I am requesting these records on behalf of the People\u2019s Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization that advocates for equitable access, protection, and affordability of utility services, and water conservation. We are filing similar requests for information with many other Michigan water utilities in collaboration with residents, community leaders, and local officials to better support the needs of low-income customers. If any of this information is publicly available and accessible, please send a link to the webpage where it is located. Please reply to this request via email. If you have any question or concern about this request, please call Cass Charrette at 248-980-1191.\r\n\r\nWhen possible, please provide the requested quantitative data in an Excel spreadsheet or other native digital format (such as CSV files). \r\n\r\n1. A copy of any data and documents that list the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service terminated starting January 1, 2019 to date of the submission of the FOIA, the reason for the termination, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this data is produced in another format, such as written logs or summary reports, please provide a copy of that instead. If your agency has a policy that home address information is exempt from FOIA, please provide this data at the street level. \r\n\r\n2. Any documents describing and listing the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service restored starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, following a disconnection. If this data is included in the same data set as Item 6, you may provide that full data set in lieu of processing this element separately.\r\n\r\n3. A copy of any existing, regularly generated reports that include the total amount of water and wastewater customer arrearages, number of customers in arrears, and median amount of arrearages per customer, and number of customers subject to potential service disconnection due to arrears by customer class (e.g., residential, non-profit, commercial, industrial) starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA. \r\n\r\n4. A copy of a list of referrals the utility/water system/municipality sent to the tax assessor to place a tax lien on properties due to non-payment of any water or sewer bill, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this information is stored in a summary database, you may provide that database.\r\n\r\n5. Any documents describing or listing the addresses of residential customer accounts that have been enrolled in and have been discharged from the Great Lakes Water Authority\u2019s Water Residential Assistance Program, and the reason for such removal or discharge, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA. \r\n\r\nAs I am requesting these records as a representative of People\u2019s Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization, and am doing so in the public interest, I request a waiver of fees. The analysis and release of these materials will contribute significantly to public understanding of water affordability issues in the tri-county area. \r\n\r\nI will expect a response within 5 business days as provided by law. If my request is denied in whole or in part, I expect a detailed justification for withholding the records. I also request any segregable portions that are not exempt to be disclosed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for reducing the burden of my request, please reach out and we are happy to discuss.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPeople\u2019s Water Board Coalition",

Thank you for your patience.\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn March 2, 2022:\r\nSubject: Michigan Freedom of Information Act Request: PWBC Tri-County FOIA Project: Residential Water Data (Clerk)\r\nDear Records Custodian,\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (MCL 15.231 et. seq.) for documents that detail how your community's water system functions, including details on utility terminations, restorations, and rates.\r\n\r\nAs context for this request, I am requesting these records on behalf of the People's Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization that advocates for equitable access, protection, and affordability of utility services, and water conservation. We are filing similar requests for information with many other Michigan water utilities in collaboration with residents, community leaders, and local officials to better support the needs of low-income customers. If any of this information is publicly available and accessible, please send a link to the webpage where it is located. Please reply to this request via email. If you have any question or concern about this request, please call Cass Charrette at 248-980-1191.\r\n\r\nWhen possible, please provide the requested quantitative data in an Excel spreadsheet or other native digital format (such as CSV files).\r\n\r\n1. A copy of any data and documents that list the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service terminated starting January 1, 2019 to date of the submission of the FOIA, the reason for the termination, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this data is produced in another format, such as written logs or summary reports, please provide a copy of that instead. If your agency has a policy that home address information is exempt from FOIA, please provide this data at the street level.\r\n\r\n2. Any documents describing and listing the addresses and dates of residential customers that have had their water service restored starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, following a disconnection. If this data is included in the same data set as Item 6, you may provide that full data set in lieu of processing this element separately.\r\n\r\n3. A copy of any existing, regularly generated reports that include the total amount of water and wastewater customer arrearages, number of customers in arrears, and median amount of arrearages per customer, and number of customers subject to potential service disconnection due to arrears by customer class (e.g., residential, non-profit, commercial, industrial) starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA.\r\n\r\n4. A copy of a list of referrals the utility/water system/municipality sent to the tax assessor to place a tax lien on properties due to non-payment of any water or sewer bill, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA, and the amount of arrears for each account. If this information is stored in a summary database, you may provide that database.\r\n\r\n5. Any documents describing or listing the addresses of residential customer accounts that have been enrolled in and have been discharged from the Great Lakes Water Authority's Water Residential Assistance Program, and the reason for such removal or discharge, starting January 1, 2019 to date of submission of the FOIA.\r\n\r\nAs I am requesting these records as a representative of People's Water Board Coalition, a non-profit organization, and am doing so in the public interest, I request a waiver of fees. The analysis and release of these materials will contribute significantly to public understanding of water affordability issues in the tri-county area.\r\n\r\nI will expect a response within 5 business days as provided by law. If my request is denied in whole or in part, I expect a detailed justification for withholding the records. I also request any segregable portions that are not exempt to be disclosed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for reducing the burden of my request, please reach out and we are happy to discuss.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPeople's Water Board Coalition\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fclerk-31729%252Fpwbc-tri-county-foia-project-residential-water-data-clerk-125620%252F%253Femail%253Dvchapman%252540cityofinkster.com&url_auth_token=AAE4BlQbZcJfd60weM7hJ0OOdJw%3A1ndmBQ%3AH4ej_qugIR-CngO3ZhYaLMmklNl6jcfafR0ljO6xC5Q\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nEXWWERWY\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 125620-57766220@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:125620-57766220@requests.muckrock.com>\r\n\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 125620\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144-2516\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

Proof of death is not required as his death was widely reported: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/obituaries/paul-laxalt.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This search is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

This includes, but is not limited to, documents, reports, multimedia, body-worn camera footage, arrest filings, and so on. It also includes all documents, notes, correspondence and memoranda evidencing sustained findings reports and investigations, and all communication and correspondence in whatever tangible medium between the officials, the victims and the overseeing agency. \r\n\r\nI am requesting digital copies of all responsive documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nHere, misconduct includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\nExcessive (unreasonable) force \u2013 beatings, manhandling of people in handcuffs, improper use of Tasers, injuries inflicted by police dogs, improper use of deadly force, and other police brutality or disregard for the safety of suspects. It also includes, but is not limited to: physical and verbal abuse, restraints happening unreasonably, coerced or forced confessions, and sexual abuse and assault. \r\n\r\nFalse arrests \u2013 pulling over, detention, questioning and searches conducted without any probable cause whatsoever, including cases of planted evidence, racial profiling and trumped-up charges of resisting arrest.\r\n\r\nAs of March 2022, public officials must release police disciplinary records in New Jersey when the public\u2019s interest in them outweighs an officer\u2019s confidentiality concerns, the state\u2019s top court ruled. \r\n\r\nThe law requires that you respond to and fulfill this request \"as promptly as possible.\"  If you expect a significant delay in responding to and fulfilling this request, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n \r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 415-769-8210 or ananyatiwarijournalism@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnanya Tiwari",

Please include any and all email correspondence that touches on the MOU arrangement in any way.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $100. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how public funds are being used to replace the Parks Department leadership with Police Department leadership and relay the information to include a cost analysis to the public by way of a news media report. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri Sunshine Law requires a response within three business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this time period, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit\r\n\r\nView request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpuyallup-school-district-24536%252Fpuyallup-school-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2015-2021-120944%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicrecords%252540puyallup.k12.wa.us&url_auth_token=AAEh3NUBNXQtivDnsWNRI6OhLoI%3A1oHUUY%3AVb-6NK25tnkESluOrb0XN2wPb342XnNjDPWGaqJRUAQ\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nPJHCCWHC\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\u2022 2022-07-29_11_11_21-Sharing_Link_Validation__Mozilla_Firefox.png\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 120944-61229246@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120944\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit\r\n\r\nView request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpuyallup-school-district-24536%252Fpuyallup-school-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2015-2021-120944%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicrecords%252540puyallup.k12.wa.us&url_auth_token=AAEh3NUBNXQtivDnsWNRI6OhLoI%3A1oHUUY%3AVb-6NK25tnkESluOrb0XN2wPb342XnNjDPWGaqJRUAQ\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nPJHCCWHC\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\u2022 2022-07-29_11_11_21-Sharing_Link_Validation__Mozilla_Firefox.png\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 120944-61229246@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120944\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record.\r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit\r\n\r\nView request history, see one related attachment, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fpuyallup-school-district-24536%252Fpuyallup-school-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2015-2021-120944%252F%253Femail%253Dpublicrecords%252540puyallup.k12.wa.us&url_auth_token=AAEh3NUBNXQtivDnsWNRI6OhLoI%3A1oHUUY%3AVb-6NK25tnkESluOrb0XN2wPb342XnNjDPWGaqJRUAQ\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nPJHCCWHC\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\u2022 2022-07-29_11_11_21-Sharing_Link_Validation__Mozilla_Firefox.png\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 120944-61229246@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120944\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is being sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share, and manage public records requests.

I am requesting records related to AMS's mascot, Milkshake the Cow.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\n(A) All records related to the conception of and process of designing the Milkshake mascot (emails and other correspondence, memoranda, contracts, sketches, etc.)\r\n\r\n(B) Records sufficient to answer the following questions:\r\n\r\n(1) Whose idea was it to create an AMs mascot in the first place, and why?\r\n\r\n(2) Who designed the Milkshake mascot, and what was the design process like? (e.g. were there multiple design concepts submitted? Was the design of the character contracted out? (If so, kindly produce the contract).\r\n\r\n(3) Were any Milkshake-related promotional items or tchotchkes created (e.g trading cards, coloring books)? If so, please produce them.\r\n\r\n(4) Were there any life-size Milkshake costumes created? If so, please produce records related to the design of the costume (contracts, sketches, etc.) and any guidelines regarding the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n(5) Did anyone in Congress ever object to AMS's use of a mascot? I understand that there have been periodic attempts by lawmakers (e.g. former Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn) to rein in agency spending on mascots. If so, please produce all records related to that.\r\n\r\n(6) What has the public's reaction been to the Milkshake mascot?\r\n\r\n(7) Is AMS still using Milkshake as part of its public outreach? If not, why not?\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

Your request was received in the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) FOIA Office on September 6, 2022 and assigned tracking number 2022-AMS-00193-F.  Please reference this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), AMS has 20 business days upon receipt of your request to make a determination.  In unusual circumstances, such as the need to search for and collect records from field offices, the need to examine a voluminous amount of records, or the need to consult with another agency, AMS can extend the 20-day time limit for processing a request.  AMS generally processes FOIA requests on a \"first-in/first-out\" basis; however, the actual processing time will depend upon the complexity of your request, including whether it involves sensitive or voluminous records, business submitter records, extensive searches, and/or multiple consultations both within and outside of the Agency.\r\n\r\nIn addition to your request for records, you asked that we waive all fees associated with processing your request.  As a requester, you bear the burden under the FOIA of showing that the fee waiver requirements have been met.  Based on our review of your request and the reasons stated, we have determined that your fee waiver request does sufficiently meet all of the criteria under the FOIA and the applicable regulations; therefore, your request for a fee waiver is approved.\r\n\r\nWe will comply with your request to the fullest extent permissible by law.  Any records not subject to an exemption will be forwarded to you promptly upon completion of AMS' search and review process.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the status of your request, please contact Kyla Niedermaier-Betts, Government Information Specialist, at (202) 961-5298 or by email at kyla.niedermaier-betts1@usda.gov<mailto:kyla.niedermaier-betts1@usda.gov>.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nHeather Higgs\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nFOIA Office\r\nAgricultural Marketing Service\r\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\r\nBozeman, Montana\r\nOffice/Cell:  (202) 641-8684\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information generated by the USDA solely for the intended recipients. Any unauthorized interception of this message or the use or disclosure of the information it contains may violate the law and subject the violator to civil or criminal penalties. If you believe you have received this message in error, please notify the sender and delete the email immediately.\n",

Please include the complete email exchange for each email, including any emails that are being replied to as well as any subsequent replies.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities. I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

External overdose data. Any and all documentation noting the number of overdose incidents of patients within 1 year of re-entry from civil commitment for substance use disorder/addiction in each year since 2015.\r\nBecause this request involves a matter of public concern and because it is made on behalf of a nonprofit organization, we ask that you waive any fees. If you decide not to waive fees, we request that you permit us to examine, at our election, the responsive documents before deciding which portions to transmit. We prefer the documents in electronic format.\r\n\r\nShould you determine that some portion of the documents requested are exempt from disclosure, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are not exempt. In addition, please note the applicable statutory exemption and explain why it applies to the redacted portions. As you know, a custodian of public records shall comply with a request within 3 business days, as the statute requires days after receipt.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance. We look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLouis Miyara\r\nHealth in Justice Action Lab\r\nNortheastern University",

Consistent with Kansas Open Records Act, K.S.A. \u00a7 45-215 through 45-223, we have begun the process of determining if the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services possesses any public records responsive to your request, and we will provide you with one or more of the following as soon as possible:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Copies of the requested public records;\r\n  2.  A statement concerning our inability to locate any public records responsive to your request;\r\n  3.  A request for clarification concerning the types of records or information you seek;\r\n  4.  A statement that records responsive to your request exist and are closed by law with an explanation of the legal basis allowing the records to be closed; or\r\n  5.  An estimate of the fees for the actual cost of responding to your request and that must be prepaid before records are produced.\r\n\r\nIf the records can be provided with less than one hour of staff time and involve no more than 100 pages, there will be no charge.  If responsive public records exist but are voluminous, difficult to locate, or contain a mix of open and closed information, it is likely that prepaid fees will be required.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this process.  KDADS will contact you again as soon as possible regarding the status of your request.\n",

Any and all documentation noting the number of non-fatal and fatal overdose incidents within each facility housing people civilly committed for substance use disorder in each year since 2015. This data is not collected in an easily identifiable fashion and will not be produced due to being an unduly burdensome task as each individuals chart since 2015 would need reviewed. See K.S.A. 45-218(e) <https://www.ksrevisor.org/statutes/chapters/ch45/045_002_0018.html>\r\n\r\nFinancial information.

Insurance assistance\r\n\r\n\r\n       e.    Any other support or health services\r\n\r\nThe treating psychiatrist will review medications with patients and provide them with necessary education on side effects, dosages, etc. Nursing staff will also review discharge medications with patients at the time of discharge. Social workers may discuss substance abuse treatment with the patient if the patient is willing to participate in an assessment. If housing is a concern then the social worker will also review available options with the patient and see what the patient is willing to consider, such as independent living, transitional living, shelter, nursing home, etc. If the patient does not have insurance, and the patient agrees and signs a release of information, staff social workers will apply for the patient to get prescription assistance through Prescription Network of Kansas. Most patients will discharge with a follow-up appointment at their local community mental health center and establish ongoing care there.\r\n\r\n6. External overdose data. Any and all documentation noting the number of overdose incidents of patients within 1 year of re-entry from civil commitment for\r\nsubstance use disorder/addiction in each year since 2015.
