Specifically, I am seeking a complete spreadsheet containing, for each such officer\u2019s certification record, the following fields:\r\n\r\nName\r\nAcademy ID number (as used in the ACADIS database)\r\nEmploying agency\r\nCertification issue date\r\nCertification status (active, inactive, revoked, etc.)\r\nSeparation date (if the certification status is now inactive)\r\nReason for separation (if the certification status is now inactive)\r\n\r\nThis request covers all time periods for which each active officer has been certified; no date range limitation is needed because I am interested in the full certification history of anyone who is currently active as a law enforcement officer. If any portion of these records is withheld as exempt, I request that you segregate any exempt material and release the rest. If possible, please provide the records in an electronic spreadsheet or database format (e.g. Excel or CSV).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nLucas",

Reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. All e-mail messages from the email address \"Raphael.Sanchez@ice.dhs.gov\" to the following e-mail address: \"Raphael_sanchez@yahoo.com.\" This includes e-mail messages with  Raphael_sanchez@yahoo.com in the \"From,\" \"To,\" \"CC,\" or \"BCC\" address lines. \r\n\r\n2. all e-mail messages from any other e-mail address currently or previously assigned to Raphael Sanchez  to the following e-mail address: \"Raphael_sanchez@yahoo.com.\" This includes e-mail messages with Raphael_sanchez@yahoo.com in the \"From,\" \"To,\" \"CC,\" or \"BCC\" address lines. \r\n\r\n3. We are requesting the results of any investigation into Raphael Sanchez related to the dispensation or misuse of confidential information related to immigrants. \r\n\r\n4. In addition to the records requested above, I also request records describing the processing of this request, including records sufficient to identify search terms used and locations and custodians searched and any tracking sheets used to track the processing of this request. If you use FOIA questionnaires or certifications completed by individual custodians or components to determine whether they possess responsive materials or to describe how they conducted searches, I also request any such records prepared in connection with the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nTo clarify my request, I seek all responsive records regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics. In conducting the search, please understand the terms \u201crecord,\u201d \u201cdocument,\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d in their broadest sense, to include any written, typed, recorded, graphic, printed, or audio material of any kind. We seek records of any kind, including electronic records, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs, as well as letters, emails, facsimiles, telephone messages, voice mail messages and transcripts, notes, or minutes of any meetings, telephone conversations or discussions. My request includes any attachments to these records, including e-mail attachments. No category of material should be omitted from search, collection, and production.\r\n\r\nPlease search all records regarding agency business. You may not exclude searches of files or emails in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files is subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, 827 F.3d 145, 149\u201350 (D.C. Cir. 2016); cf. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Kerry, 844 F.3d 952, 955\u201356 (D.C. Cir. 2016).\r\n\r\nIt is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I exercise and specifically preserve and assert my right to records contained in those files even if material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, through negligence or willfulness, failed to meet their obligations. See Competitive Enter. Inst. v. Office of Sci. & Tech. Policy, No. 14-cv-765, slip op. at 8 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2016).\r\n\r\nIn addition, please note that in conducting a \u201creasonable search\u201d as required by law, you must employ the most up-to-date technologies and tools available, in addition to searches by individual custodians likely to have responsive information. Recent technology may have rendered DHS\u2019s prior FOIA practices unreasonable. In light of the government-wide requirements to manage information electronically by the end of 2016, it is no longer reasonable to rely exclusively on custodian-driven searches. Presidential Memorandum\u2014Managing Government Records, 76 Fed. Reg. 75,423 (Nov. 28, 2011), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/28/presidentialmemorandum-managing-government-records; Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments & Independent Agencies, \u201cManaging Government Records Directive,\u201d M-12-18 (Aug. 24, 2012), https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/m-12-18.pdf.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, agencies that have adopted the National Archives and Records Agency (NARA) Capstone program, or similar policies, now maintain emails in a form that is reasonably likely to be more complete than individual custodians\u2019 files. For example, a custodian may have deleted a responsive email from his or her email program, but DHS\u2019s archiving tools would capture that email under Capstone. Accordingly, I insist that the USCIS use the most up-to-date technologies to search for responsive information and take steps to ensure that the most complete repositories of information are searched. I am available to work with you to craft appropriate search terms.\r\n\r\nIf it is your position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1974). The index must describe each document claimed as exempt with sufficient specificity \u201cto permit a reasoned judgment as to whether the material is actually exempt under FOIA.\u201d Founding Church of Scientology v. Bell, 603 F.2d 945, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Moreover, the index \u201cmust describe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of disclosing the sought-after information.\u201d King v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 223\u201324 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Further, \u201cthe withholding agency must supply \u2018a relatively detailed justification, specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.\u2019\u201d Id. at 224 (citing Mead Data Central, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).\r\n\r\nIn the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records. If it is your position that a record contains non-exempt segments, but that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the document as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt, and how the material is dispersed throughout the document. Mead Data Central, 566 F.2d at 261. Claims of nonsegregability must be made with the same degree of detail as required for claims of exemptions in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nYou should institute a preservation hold on information responsive to this request. I intend to pursue all legal avenues to enforce my right of access under the FOIA, including prompt litigation if that becomes necessary. Accordingly, the USCIS is on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable. To ensure that this request is properly construed, that searches are conducted in an adequate but efficient manner, and that extraneous costs are not incurred, I welcome an opportunity to discuss this request with you before you undertake your search or incur search or duplication costs. By working together at the outset, we can decrease the likelihood of costly and time-consuming litigation in the future. If it will accelerate release of responsive records to me, please also provide responsive material on a rolling basis.\r\n\r\nFee Waiver Request: \r\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k), I request a waiver of fees associated with processing this request for records. The subject of this request concerns the operations of the federal government, and the disclosures will likely contribute to a better understanding of relevant government procedures by the general public in a significant way. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the request is entirely and fundamentally for non-commercial purposes. 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(ii).\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees because disclosure of the requested information is \u201cin the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(1)(i); see also 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.11(k)(2)(i)-(iv).\r\n\r\nThere has been extensive media coverage of and public attention to the criminal scheme that led to the arrest and conviction of Raphael Sanchez. His sentencing was widely covered  in the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/06/28/former-ice-attorney-who-made-almost-200000-stealing-immigrants-identities-sentenced-to-4-years/?utm_term=.c3f2362ef3c1) the Seattle Times (https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/seattle-ice-lawyer-facing-prison-time-for-stealing-identities-of-would-be-immigrants/ and https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/ex-ice-attorney-sentenced-to-4-years-for-stealing-ids-of-would-be-immigrants/), the Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/28/ice-lawyer-raphael-sanchez-immigrant-identity-theft-sentence), and in local media (https://www.king5.com/article/news/crime/seattle-ice-attorney-gets-prison-time-for-stealing-identities-of-aliens/281-568780668 and https://www.theindychannel.com/about/news-team/rafael-sanchez-1 and http://kuow.org/post/how-ice-attorney-stole-immigrant-ids-years). This request seeks to uncover additional information about his criminal scheme, the prosecution of which is now completed. \r\n\r\nI am also a member of the news media and have written and researched denaturalization issues, and I request that all search and production fees be waived due to my news media status. I have written and researched at length the treatment of immigrants by ICE and the process for deporting immigrants from the United States.\r\n\r\nExpedite Request: \r\nPursuant to 6 CFR \u00a7 5.5(e)(1) I am requesting the processing and production of records in response to this request be expedited. In particular, the articles above and others indicate Raphael Sanchez was only charged with a single instance of identity theft but that there may have been many more. Immigrants who have been in removal proceedings before the Seattle Immigration Court deserve to know if their identities have been stolen. However, thus far ICE has shared no further information. For some, the need for this information will be extremely urgent, because identity theft by Mr. Sanchez or others may lead to a lifetime of irreversible consequences. \r\n\r\nAs outlined above, I am primarily engaged in disseminating information, and this matter is urgent. The loss of substantial due process rights cannot be overstated where perhaps 700,000 US Citizens would be at risk of losing their citizenship. Finally, as outlined above, this is a matter of \"widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.\" For all such reasons, the USCIS should expedite its request and produce the requested records at once.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Hoppock\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The records describing the processing of this request, including records sufficient to identify search terms used and locations and custodians searched and any tracking sheets used to track the processing of this request and any such records prepared in connection with the processing of this request. Thus, the agency has not conducted an adequate search or responded to the substance of the request. \r\n\r\nSecond, regarding the portion of the request that the agency does respond to, a GLOMAR response is inappropriate, as the investigation into Raphael Sanchez is already public record. Mr. Sanchez was criminally prosecuted, has been sentenced, and is in prison for stealing the identities of immigrants. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/06/28/former-ice-attorney-who-made-almost-200000-stealing-immigrants-identities-sentenced-to-4-years/?utm_term=.d823904ff7df. He lacks any privacy interest in his criminal actions, and the public nature of the prosecution makes any interest the agency has in maintaining privacy null and void. The agency should release the responsive records related to its investigations of Raphael Sanchez, even though Sanchez was already prosecuted and sentenced and his criminal case is completed.",

After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is too broad in scope, did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or only posed questions to the agency. ICE FOIA will need a search start/end date pertaining to Raphael Sanchez email messages.\u00a0 Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.\u00a0 For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.\u00a0 Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record. The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.\u00a0 Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.  If we do not hear from you within\u00a030\u00a0days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.\u00a0 Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future.  Your request has been assigned reference number 2019-ICAP-00056. Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence. To check the status of an ICE FOIA/PA request, please visit . Please note that to check the status of a request, you must enter the 2019-ICAP-00056 (http://www.dhs.gov/foia-status) http://www.dhs.gov/foia-status tracking number.

I understand you need a search start/end date for the emails Mr. Sanchez sent to and from his ICE email address to his private Yahoo email address. According to the felony complaint against Mr. Sanchez filed in the Western District of Washington, Mr. Sanchez was using the private Yahoo email address to steal immigrants' identites from October 1, 2013 and October 25, 2017. Accordingly, I am requesting the emails Mr. Sanchez sent to and from the Yahoo email address during that period. Also, because it appears Mr. Sanchez only used the Yahoo address to steal immigrants' identities, all of the email messages he sent between the two accounts will be relevant to my request. I cannot limit the search to a particular set of keywords, but all email messages sent between the two accounts should be a small set of records and all of them are related to my research.   \r\n\r\nYou have no requested more information about Categories 3 and 4 of my request, so I will presume you do not need any further information about them. Should you need anything further, please let me know. Thank you. \r\n\r\nMatthew Hoppock",

I understand you need a search start/end date for the emails Mr. Sanchez sent to and from his ICE email address to his private Yahoo email address. According to the felony complaint against Mr. Sanchez filed in the Western District of Washington, Mr. Sanchez was using the private Yahoo email address to steal immigrants' identites from October 1, 2013 and October 25, 2017. Accordingly, I am requesting the emails Mr. Sanchez sent to and from the Yahoo email address during that period. Also, because it appears Mr. Sanchez only used the Yahoo address to steal immigrants' identities, all of the email messages he sent between the two accounts will be relevant to my request. I cannot limit the search to a particular set of keywords, but all email messages sent between the two accounts should be a small set of records and all of them are related to my research.\r\n\r\nYou have not requested more information about Categories 3 and 4 of my request, so I will presume you do not need any further information about them. Should you need anything further, please let me know. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMatthew Hoppock\"",

This information may be gathered together in a single document like a data dictionary, entity layout, or user's guide. If that is the case, I request access to and copy of said document. Should the records above represent certain values as numeric codes or abbreviations that are not self-explanatory, I additionally request all records necessary to interpret those codes and abbreviations.\r\n\r\nData format \r\nI request these records in their native digital formats and not in formats that degrade the accessibility of the records, such as tabular data converted to PDF or Word files. If converting the native digital format to another high-fidelity format, such as CSV or Excel, please take care not to introduce formatting inconsistencies or errors, which can occur in the conversion process (for example, encoding errors or the inclusion of internal unescaped quotation marks in CSV files).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Dillon Bergin.",

Records of the most recent inventory of rifles possessed by the Sheriff's Office, as defined in Sections 30510 and 30515 of the Penal Code (assault rifles, patrol rifles, sniper rifles, .50 caliber rifles).\r\n2. Records indicating the number of rifles, as defined in Sections 30510 and 30515 of the Penal Code,  privately possessed by personnel of the Sheriff's Office with its authorization, OR the number of Sheriff's Office personnel with such authorization.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, I ask that you make records available to me as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n \r\nThe requested documents or information from them will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the American Friends Service Committee California Healing Justice Program at jlindsay-poland@afsc.org or by phone at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Your agency has also been subject to litigation for failures to administer proper procedures that have resulted in deaths from a mass shooting (Parkland, FL).  I feel the information as presented shows an overwhelming government interest in the agency maintaining public trust adhering to transparency and guiding its own public image or lack thereof. \r\n\r\nAgain, you are petitioned to waive the fees in the public interest. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Fernandes",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Your request was assigned ATF tracking number 2024-01599.  Please refer to this number in any future communications regarding this request. \r\n\r\nThe records you seek require a search in at least one other office within ATF.  Accordingly, your request presents \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d under the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii)(I).  Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request by ten additional days, as permitted by the statute.  We have not completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.  The time needed to process your request will depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located. \r\n\r\nFor your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks: simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  Your request was assigned to the Complex track.  It was placed in chronological order based on the date of receipt and will be handled as quickly as possible when it is assigned for processing. \r\n\r\nBecause this Office is not assessing any fees in connection with the processing of FOIA requests at this time, there is no need for us to determine whether your request qualifies for a waiver of fees. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the status of your request, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at 202-648-7390.   Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nHirsh D.

Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v.

This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at dillon@muckrock.com, or by phone at (267) 314-7952.

Public Officers Law Section 87(2)(b) excepts from disclosure records or portions thereof that if disclosed \u201cwould constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under the provisions of [Public Officers Law\u00a0\u00a7 89(2)].\u201d\u00a0 Public Officers Law Section 89(2)(b)(i) prohibits the disclosure of a person\u2019s medical history.\u00a0 Public Officers Law Section 89(2)(c) offers a cure to complete non-disclosure by redacting identifying details. \r\nBecause the records responsive to your request contain the names and other identifying information of individuals regarding their health care, that information was redacted pursuant to Public Officers Law Section 87(2)(b) to protect their personal privacy. See Hanig v. State of New York Department of Motor Vehicles, 79 N.Y.2d 106 (1992) (\u201cOnce it is determined that the requested material falls within a FOIL exemption, no further policy analysis is required.\u00a0 It is enough that the Legislature has determined to classify the release of such information as an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d) \r\nPlease log in to the FOIL Records Access Center at the following link to review the responsive records.

At a minimum, this should include all questions asked, orally or in writing, of the the three finalists whom the search committee interviewed during closed session.\r\n\r\nWhile the RESPONSES to those questions may currently be exempt from disclosure under the FOIA, the questions themselves, without connecting them to any candidate responses, should be fully releasable without restriction. Further, whereas the BOV Search Committee committed to transparency, there should be a record of all questions asked (written or oral) for transparency.\r\n\r\nGiven that the interviews were just conducted, the records responsive to this request should be immediately available.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

        "communication": "In any normal, open, and transparent search and hiring process, the search committee and interviewees develop goals and objectives for the traits to evaluate candidates against. If a process is truly fair and balanced, there is a set of questions that all candidates are asked. Then, the freewheeling questions may follow during discussion, which may or may not be captured.\r\n\r\nA review of previously released documents about VMI hiring shows that for the last Superintendent Search and the last two Commandant Searches, this practice was followed, and all standard questions were eventually made public (some through FOIA). In addition, while deliberations are protected in closed sessions, there is no reasonable expectation of protection for the a list of the topics the candidates were asked about and the questions they were asked, especially when this request is for the questions themselves and neither responses nor who they were directed to is requested.\r\n\r\nof all candidates during all phases of the search, interview, and selection process for the new superintendent from the start of the recruiting to the date of this request. At a minimum, this should include all questions asked, orally or in writing, of the the three finalists whom the search committee interviewed during closed session.\r\n\r\nAgain, \"the questions themselves, without connecting them to any candidate responses, should be fully releasable without restriction\" for the search committee and BOV members.\r\n\r\nIf \"records do not exist\" for standard topics and questions for all candidates, it means VMI is stipulating that neither the search committee nor the BOV itself had any standard lines of inquiry put to the three finalists so as to assess their responses against each other on essential topics used in the final evaluation and selection.  That would be the definition of an arbitrary and capricious evaluation and selection process.\r\n\r\nIf, however, VMI chooses to state that it refuses to disclose what these standard questions were, then this is another issue and has the effect of saying that the public does not have the right (in VMI's view) to know the priorities used in the selection process.\r\n\r\nI trust this clarifies the scope.

If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables. \r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if school districts or job titles are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so. \r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc). \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I was quoted a rough estimate of $400 for the digital evidence on 6/25/2024, but at the time I declined to move forward with the digital evidence portion and the request was closed. I would now like to move forward with digital evidence and I'm writing to request an invoice. Also, would it be possible for me to get an index or list of contents for the digital evidence portion, so I would know in advance what it will contain? Is there any other material in this case? Would the State's Attorney's office be able to help me with further discovery documents?\r\nMany thanks for your help,\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMikita Brottman",

Is there any other material in this case?...\"\r\n\r\nAn initial estimate of the costs and special service charges (for extensive use of information technology resources and extensive clerical and supervisory assistance) for the time required to search for, identify, compile, and potentially redact the responsive records is as follows:\r\n*       Evidence Personnel, 1 hours at $38.50 per hour;\r\n*       Initial review: 1 audio, 1,839 photos, 10 videos totaling over 4 hours of footage (see invoice for notes);\r\n\r\nThe total estimated special service charge in connection with your request is $77.00.  An invoice is attached regarding the total invoice amount.\r\nUpon receipt of the estimated charges, payable through the JustFOIA portal, the City will continue to process your records request. These estimated charges will be adjusted based upon the actual time spent in identifying, compiling, and potentially redacting the requested records. If the actual costs are determined to be less than the estimated costs, the difference will be refunded to you. If the actual costs are higher than the estimated costs, we will contact you and provide the additional cost information.\r\nTo pay online with a credit card, click here https://bocaratonfl.justfoia.com/publicportal (your Security Key # 0AD3AE3A, Request # 2025-9180 will be required). You will be redirected to a separate site to submit credit card information and will receive your receipt for payment via email.\r\nIn compliance with the Public Records Act, the City has used good faith and reasonable efforts to review and assess your request and develop the estimates provided herein. If you believe that we have misunderstood the scope and/ or nature of your request, please contact us to provide clarification so that we may correctly estimate the service charges and costs in connection with a modified search.\r\n\r\n\r\n[X]\r\nRaven Doyle  |  Multimedia Evidence Custodian\r\nCity of Boca Raton, Field Services Division\r\n100 NW 2nd Ave, Boca Raton, FL 33432\r\nP  561-338-1341  |  rdoyle@bocaraton-fl.gov<mailto:rdoyle@bocaraton-fl.gov>\r\n\r\nStay connected with us on social media!<http://www.myboca.us/stayconnected>\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note: Florida has a very broad public records law.
