I was there with him along with my friend Emily. I called the police department a couple days after the incident asking for more details. I\u2019m worried my brain has distorted some of the memory from that call and I\u2019m looking to make sure I heard the phone call correctly..the police officer said someone was up there with him and that\u2019s why he fell. Im look for clarity to make sure that\u2019s correct. I have no means to hurt or go after anyone, I wanna make sure when I\u2019m talking about it I\u2019m saying the right thing.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nChiara Cross",
