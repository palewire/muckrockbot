The NamUs case file number for this person is 4326. According to the NamUs listing, the decedent was witnessed jumping out of a window. In addition, a suicide note was found in his pocket. The DME presumably concluded their investigation long ago. \r\n\r\nPlease search for a coroner's report(s) that could be labeled as \"exam protocol\", \"medical report\", \"case report\" or \"investigator's narrative.\"\r\n\r\n I am hopeful that the release of information will assist in the identification of this person.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",
