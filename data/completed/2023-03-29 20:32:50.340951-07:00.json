        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days. If you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-338-1050 or by email at Erinstewart@cfjj.org. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nErin Stewart\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice",

The link covers budget years from 2017 through 2022.  You can search within the link to find what amounts were spent on social workers, BCBAs, etc., as well as the number of staff that were hired/budgeted for each of these years, along with what schools said staff may have been assigned to.\r\n\r\nYou can also find the number of guidance counselors and/or what schools they were assigned to for the same periods of 2017-2022.\r\n\r\nThe link is as follows:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.lowell.k12.ma.us/Page/191\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, your request has been shared with the Lowell Police Department, so that they can respond to information that corresponds to them and that exists and that responds to your questions.\r\n\r\nFor example, the only public information that exists and that responds to your questions as to police arrest/referrals in schools is shown in the link in the email further below (dated 3/2/2023).  Information like badge numbers, arresting officer, charges, etc., is not information that exists.  The contact person at the Lowell Police Department Jaqueline Cook at JCook@lowellma.gov\r\n\r\nIt is also my understanding that the cost of school resources and number is something that is within the City, not the Lowel Public School Budget, so again, that is something that the Lowell Police Department should be able to provide you with.\r\n\r\nAs I receive more information, I will continue to pass it on.  I should be providing you a copy of the MOU between the Lowell Public School and the Lowell Police Department shortly.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.\r\n\nThanks and my best\r\n\r\nMike Ortiz\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nLowell Public Schools\r\n978-674-2123",

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

        "communication": "Good Morning Ms. Best ,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIPA request made for records concerning Financial News Network.  The FBI located approximately 7,015 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.  \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, we would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  If you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nThe current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 56 months. \r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-4894.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov\r\n540-868-4894",

Your request has been assigned tracking number FP-22-004070.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised this office is not a repository for documents. Therefore, we must determine where the information you have requested would be located and request a document search be conducted by the relevant records custodians.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to process your request at this time. Please be advised that your request, as submitted, is not perfected. It does not reasonably describe the records sought, as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. Please note that, pursuant to 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.5, FOIA requests must describe the documents requested in sufficient detail to allow the FOIA Office to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Additionally, the FOIA does not require agencies to create records in response to FOIA requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reached out to our National Water Safety Program Manager, who will need additional information in order to search for documents. Please note that Bobber has been the USACE National Water Safety Mascot for several years and is used agency\u2011wide, so it would be impossible to provide the number of times Bobber has been mentioned and/or featured in USACE materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore specificity would be helpful. (1) Are you willing to narrow the scope of your request to include specific USACE districts or locations? (2) You provide a very broad list of categories for the types of documents and records you seek; however, what documents or records are most relevant to the information you need for your specific purpose? (3) Please provide a specific timeframe?\r\n\r\nPlease reply to this message by narrowing the scope of your request to more reasonably describe the records you seek. Any details you can provide will be helpful.\r\n\r\nYour request file will remain open for 10 business days while we await your response. If no response is received by February 2, 2022, we will assume you are no longer interested and will close your request.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nMary Alice Smith\r\nParalegal Specialist\r\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers\r\nHECSA - Office of Counsel\r\n7701 Telegraph Road\r\nAlexandria, VA  22315\r\n703-428-8160 (office)\r\n703-428-7221 (fax)\r\nMary.A.Smith@usace.army.mil\r\n\r\nTHIS IS A PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION -ATTORNEY-CLIENT/ATTORNEY WORK-PRODUCT.

Was the design of the character contracted out? (If so, kindly produce the contract).\r\n(3) When and how were the other characters in what I'm going to call the \"Bobber Extended Universe\" created? (e.g. Ranger Buck, Ranger Jane, Ranger Toro, Tackle, Jacques Catsto, Corkey, Sinker)\r\n(4) Were any Bobber-related promotional items or tchotchkes created (e.g trading cards, coloring books)? If so, please produce them.\r\n(5) Were there any life-size Bobber costumes created? If so, please produce records related to the design of the costume (contracts, sketches, etc.) and any guidelines regarding the use of or care for the costume.\r\n(6) Did anyone in Congress ever object to USCA's use of a mascot? I understand that there have been periodic attempts by lawmakers (e.g. former Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn) to rein in agency spending on mascots. If so, please produce all records related to that.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is sufficient information to enable your search.\r\n\r\nWith best regards,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

I filed the request on 16 November 2021, and it was assigned the tracking number FP-22-004070. The request seeks records related to USACE's water safety mascot \"Bobber.\" Over a year has passed since I filed the request, and all that USACE has done was ask me to narrow the scope of my request in January 2022. I did so and have heard nothing from USACE since that time. I reached out to their FOIA Liaison last month but have received no response. Thus, I respectfully request mediation services from OGIS. My entire correspondence with USACE can be found here, as I filed this request via the FOIA-and-journalism website MuckRock.com: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/bobber-121319/#comms.

The closure reason supplied was:\r\n\r\nDear Belle,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for contacting the San Francisco Controller\u2019s Office. The Controller serves as the chief accounting officer and auditor for the City and County of San Francisco. The Controller's Office is responsible for governance and conduct of key aspects of the City's financial operations, including operating the City's financial systems and issuing its financial procedures, maintaining the City's internal control environment, processing payroll for City employees, managing the City's bonds and debt portfolio, and processing and monitoring the City's budget. The department audits and produces regular reports on the City's financial and economic condition and the operations and performance of City government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Public Records Act requires an agency to make available to any person a copy of an, \u201cidentifiable record or records\u201d in its possession (California Government Code \u00a77922.530(a) (formerly \u00a76253(b)).) The City\u2019s obligation under the Sunshine Ordinance, like the California Public Records Act, is to produce public records in its custody (San Francisco Administration Code \u00a767.20(b).) There is no requirement that a department or officer construct a document to meet the specifications of the request. Your request is so open-ended and all-encompassing that it must be narrowed to meet this identifiability standard. The Controller's Office is available to assist you in formulating a request that meets that standard. Please feel free to contact us for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease also find links below to online tools including SFOpenBook, DataSF and SFController Reports, where the Public has 24/7 access to City budget, financial, supplier and operating data.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* SFOpenBook -\u00a0https://openbook.sfgov.org\r\n\r\n* DataSF -\u00a0https://datasf.org\r\n\r\n* SFController -\u00a0Reports Search\r\n\r\n* CCSF\u2019s Public Records Requests -\u00a0https://sanfrancisco.nextrequest.com\r\n\r\n* CCSF Index to Records -\u00a0https://index.sfgov.org\r\n\r\n* CCSF Board of Supervisors Legislation &amp; Related Reporting -\u00a0https://sfgov.legistar.com/Legislation.aspx\r\n\r\n* San Francisco Sales Tax Map\u00a0-\u00a0http://sfstax.hdlgov.com/geodata/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes your public records request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClaire Stone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice of the Controller\r\n\r\nCity and County of San Francisco\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City and County of San Francisco.<br></br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href='https://help.nextrequest.com/knowledge/requester-resources'>help page</a>",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing SummerCon AKA CyberView, one of the oldest\r\n    hacker conventions, and the longest running such conference in the US.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a public records request made via MuckRock under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, seeking records related to law enforcement officer certification in this state.\r\n\r\nThis request is brought by Big Local News along with a collaboration of news organizations, including ABC News, KQED, MuckRock and other news organizations. Big Local News is a program of Stanford University\u2019s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and helps journalists collect, process and analyze public data. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking two categories of certification records:   \r\n\r\n* All certified officers \r\nAll law enforcement officers who are actively certified as of the date of this request (or when the request is processed). If your system maintains historical records of previously certified officers who are no longer active, please include them as far back as possible. If correctional officers are certified by your agency, please include them as well.  \r\n\r\n* Decertified officers\r\nAll law enforcement officers who have been decertified through revocations, voluntary surrenders, suspensions or any other actions going back as far as possible. Please include records for decertified correctional officers if available. \r\n\r\nData elements for certified officers:\r\n* Officer unique ID number \r\n* POST or state certification ID number\r\n* Officer\u2019s full name\r\n* Officer\u2019s date of birth or, if not releasable, year of birth or current age\r\n* Officer\u2019s city and/or zip code of residence\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current department or agency\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current department or agency start date\r\n* Officer\u2019s last/current position and/or rank at that department or agency\r\n* Officer\u2019s previous departments/agencies (employment history), with start and end dates\r\n* Officer\u2019s positions and/or ranks at previous departments or agencies\r\n* Officer\u2019s original date of certification\r\n* Current status of certification (active, lapsed, expired, suspended, etc.)\r\n* Last action taken on certification\r\n* Date of last action on certification \r\n* Disciplinary actions taken against this officer\u2019s certification\r\n* Dates of disciplinary actions taken against this officer\u2019s certification\r\n* Training history/additional certifications of this officer, if available\r\n\r\nData elements for decertified officers: \r\n* Officer unique ID number \r\n* POST ID number\r\n* Officer\u2019s full name\r\n* Officer\u2019s date of birth or, if not releasable, year of birth or current age\r\n* Officer\u2019s city and/or zip code of residence.\r\n* Officer\u2019s last department/agency, with start and end date\r\n* Officer\u2019s last position and/or rank at that department or agency\r\n* Decertification action taken (revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, etc.)\r\n* Date decertification action taken\r\n* POST case number, if applicable\r\n* Reason for decertification or similar action\r\n\r\nIf your certification system contains data elements not listed above, please include them in the response, provided they are releasable under the law. On the other hand, we recognize some of the information we are asking for may not be tracked by your system. If that is the case, we are willing to accept as many of the data elements as your agency maintains. If some records are more readily available, we are happy to receive partial information as soon as possible while the remaining request is processed. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the data elements listed, we request documentation necessary to understand and interpret the data, including but not limited to record layouts, data dictionaries, code sheets, lookup tables, etc. \r\n\r\nOur preference is to receive structured data provided in a machine-readable text file, such as delimited or fixed-width formats. We can also handle a variety of other data formats including SQL databases, Excel workbooks and MS Access. If there are additional formats your agency would prefer to provide, please let us know. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking this information as a news media organization on a matter of public interest concerning the conduct of government. As such, we ask for a waiver of all fees, if allowed under state law. If fees are necessary to reimburse the agency for actual costs, we agree to pay up to $100. If costs exceed that amount, please let us know before fulfilling the request.\r\n\r\nPlease send clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time. Thank you very much for your time and attention to this request.\r\n\r\nElisabeth Gawthrop \r\nData Journalist \r\nAmerican Public Media Research Lab \r\n317-410-7884",

Data practices law requires entities to allow viewing of data records when they are in a format that does not exist in a different format. Under Minnesota law, and most other states that I\u2019m aware of, the responding entity is not required to create additional reports or new formats to produce data that it has provided or is already providing. Historically, requestors would have to come into the office to view certain records, in this case we are providing it in an online format. If you want to access the individual disciplinary records or training records, you may download them from the public portal.\r\n\r\nAgain, in this case, between the two formats, you are receiving all of the data requested and POST is under no obligation to produce the same data in a different format. The entity providing the data is not under any obligation to create a method or configure software to produce the data already provided. We expended significant expense to create an API to display the data in the public portal.\r\n\r\nErik Misselt - Executive Director\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.jpg@01D96091.1D3D6EB0]\r\nBoard of Peace Officer Standards and Training\r\n1600 University Avenue, Suite 200, Saint Paul, MN 55104\r\nMain: (651) 643-3060  |  www.post.state.mn.us<http://www.post.state.mn.us>\r\nDirect # 651-201-7789\r\nerik.misselt@state.mn.us<mailto:erik.misselt@state.mn.us>\r\n\r\nNOTICE: The information contained in (and attached to) this e-mail is intended only for the personal and confidential use of the designated recipient(s) named above.

Otherwise, I would prefer these records in an electronic format. \r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10.  However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of police practices. As the Senate Rules Committee wrote in its May 26, 2018 floor analysis**: \r\n\r\n\"Making regulations of law enforcement agencies easily accessible to the public helps educate the public about law enforcement policies, practices, and procedures, increases communication and community trust, and enhances transparency while saving costs and labor associated with responding to individual requests for this information.\"\r\n\r\nThis information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe California Public Records Act requires a response within 10 business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nI can be reached via email at the email address listed on this request.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nStanford University Libraries\r\n\r\nRelevant links\r\n* https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=13650\r\n\r\n* * https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB978#",

Imperial Tobacco PLC, between January 1, 2020 and present.\"  Based on what you have requested, I have to run email searches separate from the OSH inspection information because emails are maintained in a separate system. Due to the sensitive nature of emails, I am the only authorized person within the agency with all email access who may run such a search.\r\nTo date, I have attempted to run the requested company names in a myriad of ways, but because of the commonality of several words  (e.g., alliance, brands, tobacco) and your request for \"all of the agency's email correspondence\" (no specific NC Dept of Labor employee), I am getting thousands of emails that include those words; further, the search must be run through all 350+ NCDOL employees, so each search is taking several hours to run.  I then have to review the emails to see if the email is applicable to your request, such as only referring to \"Alliance One International\" instead of some other Alliance One reference.  I have continued to attempt to refine the searches, in an attempt to produce a more reasonable-sized list. Please be advised that based on my prior attempts, I must advise you that it will  take me extensive time to go through such information.\r\nIs there a way you can refine your request or narrow the time frame?  Are there any specific NCDOL employees that may have been corresponding with these companies or are there specific email addresses within those named companies that I could use to refine the search?  Any information would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nJill F.

I relate this information to you primarily because the terms you indicated (green tobacco illness, heat stress) probably will have little to no connections directly the listed tobacco companies in relation to potential Occupational Safety and Health complaints.\r\n\r\nIn relation to that, growers or Farm Labor Contractors (FLC) would be the more likely employer of workers.  The FLC\u2019s generally recruit and hire seasonal or temporary agricultural laborers; in addition, they may also transport, house, and provide meals for workers.  FLC\u2019s are required to obtain a federal certification: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/agriculture/mspa/farm-labor-contractors.   Here is an actual US Department of Labor news release: https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20210804-0.  Further, H2A workers fare certified under the authority of the US Department of Labor; see this article: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/agriculture/h2a/final-rule\r\n\r\nPlease also be apprised that NC Department of Labor participates in an advisory capacity to a group that also includes Alliance One International, Inc. The group is the Farm Labor Practices Group (FLPG), which states that it \u201cis a multi-stakeholder initiative, formed in 2012, committed to improving labor practices on farms and thereby enhancing the farmworker\u2019s experience.  The FLPG brings together key voices representing different sectors and perspectives, including growers/farmers, worker advocates, manufacturers and others who sell agricultural products, and government agencies.  The work of the FLPG is facilitated by a third party, the Keystone Policy Center, and includes the following member organizations.\u201d https://farmlaborpracticesgroup.org/about-us/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.keystone.org/our-work/agriculture/farm-labor-practices-group/\r\n\r\n\u2022           Alliance One International, Inc.  (global HQ is in Morrisville, NC)\r\n\u2022           Altria Client Services LLC\r\n\u2022           Consulate General of Mexico in Raleigh*\r\n\u2022           Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility\r\n\u2022           North Carolina Agribusiness Council, Inc.*\r\n\u2022           North Carolina Agromedicine Institute*\r\n\u2022           North Carolina Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services*\r\n\u2022           North Carolina Department of Commerce \u2013 Division of Workforce Solutions*\r\n\u2022           North Carolina Department of Labor \u2013 Agricultural Safety and Health*\r\n\u2022           North Carolina Farm Bureau*\r\n\u2022           Phillip Morris International (PMI)\r\n\u2022           RAI Service Company\r\n\u2022           Tobacco Growers Association of North Carolina\r\n\u2022           Universal Leaf Tobacco Company, Inc\r\n\u2022           U.S. Department of Labor \u2013 Wage and Hour Division\r\n*Advisory member\r\n\r\nBeth Rodman, the Bureau Chief of the Agricultural Safety and Health Bureau of the Occupational Safety and Health Division, is the NCDOL employee who participates in FLPG workgroups that meet regularly such as the Training and Education workgroup and the FLC workgroup.  In relation to FLPG, she noted that many concerns related to FLCs are outside of the scope of the NC Department of Labor\u2019s statutory authority.  Examples include wage issues (because they fall under USDOL and not NCDOL), contractual violations, visa fraud, recruitment concerns, human trafficking (all of which are outside of this agency\u2019s statutory authority). Therefore, there will be multiple emails included related to this group.  If you do NOT want any of these emails, please let me know.\r\n\r\nI created another pdf that I attempted to attach, but it is too large; I will have to recreate it into smaller files.  I will send the final set next week.\r\n\r\n\r\nJill F.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Additionally, the access to this information would not advance the public interest in understanding \u201cthe affairs of government and the official acts and policies of those who represent them[.]\u201d 5 ILCS 140/1. Further, the landline numbers and other email addresses for these employees is available to the public, which further limits the de minimis public interest in the contact information of the requested employees. See Shurtleff v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 991 F. Supp. 2d 1, 18 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2013) (\u201cThe EPA has proferred a substantial privacy interest at stake in disclosing the official internal email address of the EPA Administrator and the work email address of employees at the EOP: these few individuals have \u2018a significant personal interest in preventing the burden of unsolicited emails and harassment.\u2019\u201d); Buckovetz v. U.S. Department of the Navy, Case No. 14-cv-2115-BEN, 2016 WL 4801335 at *2-3 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 7, 2016) (affirming the redaction of an employee\u2019s cell phone number, because \u201cthe [employee\u2019s] privacy rights in this information outweigh the public\u2019s interest in disclosure\u201d).\u201d You have the right to have a denial reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd Street, Springfield, Illinois 62701, (877) 299-3642.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt.
