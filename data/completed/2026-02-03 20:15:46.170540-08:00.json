        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\n1. All departmental or municipal policies regarding communication and information sharing between departmental officers or employees and federal agents/agencies within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including but not limited to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The records request includes, but is not limited to, policies regarding: \r\n\r\nA. Fingerprint and other data sharing, \r\n\r\nB. ICE detainer requests,   \r\n\r\nC. Compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including guidance or policies around when communication with ICE officers is allowed, and \r\n\r\nD. Communicating with federal immigration enforcement officers. \r\n\r\nThis request covers any policies that are currently in effect or that have been in effect at any point on or after January 20, 2025. \r\n\r\n2. The three most recent communications (e.g., emails, text messages, call logs or transcripts, or otherwise) between a departmental officer or employee and a federal DHS or ICE employee. In addition, I request all records related to these communications, including, but not limited to, any records indicating that the department was made aware of the communications, discussions of their content or implications, evaluations them for compliance with departmental or other city policies, identification or acknowledgement of any potential policy violations, and any internal responses, disciplinary actions, or follow-up measures resulting from these communications. \r\n\r\n3. All records relating to incidents, if any, from January 20, 2025, to the day this request is responded to, in which an individual was taken from the department\u2019s custody directly into ICE custody. For each incident, the records request includes, but is not limited to, booking and transfer records, communications with ICE or other federal agencies, internal documentation or discussion of the transfer, and internal notes, memos, or documentation referencing communication with DHS or ICE.\r\n\r\nFor each request, I am not seeking identifying information, and I will accept anonymized or redacted data as necessary to protect identities. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. I expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff \r\n\r\nJoshuadankoff@cfjj.org  \r\n\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives \r\n\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice  \r\n\r\n(submitted via MuckRock platform)",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to Florida's Public Records Law (Chapter 119, Florida Statutes), I submit the following records request:\r\n\r\nI would first and foremost like to thank your department for previous cooperation with my audit requests as I know that this requires additional time and effort from department personnel. However, my previous audit left some questions as to the department's use of Flock systems and safeguards that are in place to ensure the security and privacy of the residents of Okaloosa County. My intent is to gain insight into your department's use of the Flock system due to national concern of agencies overstepping 4th amendment rights and well documented misuse of this system by other agencies. If your department is truly using this system as advertised, then I would love nothing more than to share those facts with concrete evidence as I imagine that this information would help citizens, including myself, to feel more at ease with the use of this system around our homes and places of work. \r\n\r\n- Records Related to the Department's Flock Safety System:\r\n\r\n1. Financial Records:\r\n   1a. Any internal financial audits conducted regarding expenditures on the Flock Safety contract from inception to present\r\n   1b. If no formal internal audit exists, a written statement or documentation showing the approximate annual expenditure by the department on the Flock Safety contract\r\n   1c. The total contract value\r\n   1d. The contract renewal date or expiration date\r\n   1e. Any amendments to the original contract affecting financial terms\r\n\r\n2. Contract and Agreement Documents:\r\n   2a. The complete, executed contract(s) between the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Department and Flock Safety, including all terms and conditions\r\n   2b. Service level agreements\r\n   2c. Data sharing provisions and agreements with Flock Safety\r\n   2d. Privacy disclosure information and policies\r\n   2e. Data retention and deletion policies\r\n   2f. Third-party data access provisions\r\n   2g. All amendments, addendums, or modifications to the original contract\r\n\r\n3. Internal Use Policy and Accountability Measures:\r\n   3a. Policies regarding authorized users and permissible uses of the system\r\n   3b. Training requirements for deputies and other personnel\r\n   3c. Audit and oversight procedures\r\n   3d. Accountability measures for system misuse or unauthorized access\r\n   3e. Procedures for conducting searches and queries\r\n   3f. Legal justification requirements for searches (warrant requirements, reasonable suspicion standards, etc.)\r\n\r\n4. Security and Privacy Safeguards:\r\n   4a. Authentication requirements (e.g., two-factor authentication policies)\r\n   4b. Password policies, including requirements for length, complexity, and rotation\r\n   4c. Standards for regular user account access audits and reviews\r\n   4d. Cybersecurity vulnerability assessments or security reviews conducted on the Flock Safety system\r\n\r\n- Clarification Regarding Requested Records:\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I am requesting financial documents, contract documents, policy documents, and security documentation (of the administrative use of the Flock System) that document expenditures, contractual obligations, internal governance, and system security measures. The contracts, financial records, and policy documents requested are standard public records that document how public funds are spent and how government agencies operate, and do not contain information that would compromise law enforcement operations, ongoing investigations, or reveal investigative practices as these documents are administrative in nature.\r\n\r\n- Accommodation for Partial Exemptions:\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the requested records contains information that your department believes is exempt under Florida law, I respectfully request that you provide the records with appropriate redactions of only that specific exempt information, rather than withholding the records in their entirety. Florida's Public Records Law requires that exemptions be narrowly construed, and non-exempt portions of records must be disclosed even when some portions are exempt.\r\n\r\n- Additional Questions:\r\n\r\nHere are several questions that I would greatly appreciate responses to in addition to the above requested records:\r\n\r\n1. Is your department aware of the numerous security vulnerabilities that have been discovered by security researchers (such as the YouTube channel Benn Jordan: see this video; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB0gr7Fh6lY) to include antiquated operating system software, admin portals left open to web access with default credentials, and Flock accounts for sale on the dark web to name a few?\r\n\r\n2. I saw on your departments Facebook post, on the 12th of January 2026, that your department requires outside agencies to provide warrants and/or investigative reasoning for data regarding Okaloosa residents. In my audit of your logs I noticed several logs that indicated that searches were also being done on behalf of county investigators as well (specifically A. Planck). Are internal uses of the system for investigations into suspicious activities or on behalf of investigators also required to provide a warrant or other legal justification for searches conducted on the Flock system?\r\n\r\n3. What is your department's view on the case currently under review of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia regarding Flock cameras? To quote an article: \"Chief Judge Davis rejected the city\u2019s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, citing the United States Supreme Court case Carpenter v. United States, which held that using cell phone location data to track someone\u2019s movements is a search that requires a warrant under the Fourth Amendment. Chief Judge Davis wrote, \u201ca reasonable person could believe that society\u2019s expectations, as laid out by the Court in Carpenter, are being violated by the Norfolk Flock system.\u201d\".\r\n(citation: https://ij.org/press-release/judge-rules-lawsuit-challenging-norfolks-use-of-flock-cameras-can-proceed/)\r\n\r\n- Format and Delivery:\r\n\r\nPlease provide records in their original electronic, machine-readable format. For example, please provide PDF format for contracts and policy documents, and spreadsheet files where applicable for financial data. Please do not redirect me to your transparency portal.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment or Dropbox link.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as Florida law requires. If you believe any portion of the requested records is exempt, please provide a detailed explanation identifying the specific exemption and how it applies to the specific data withheld.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nKyle Searfoss",

Any/all records and writings regarding salary, benefits, and compensation of the Grandview School District Public Records Officer.\r\n\r\n2.

Any/all records and writings referencing any invoices for any legal work (including consulting and representation) performed on behalf of the Grandview School District in response to public records requests and/or public records act litigation. \r\n\r\nDATE RANGE OF REQUEST\r\n\r\nThe date range for records responsive to this request is January 01, 2020 - October 01, 2024.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS - ORDER OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FORMAT BY DATE. The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide copies of all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide copies of all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

        "communication": "This letter is in response to your public records request received by the Grandview School District. We are providing the Second installment, which includes records in response to Items #2 and #3 of your request. Those items seek:\r\n\r\n1)\tAny/all records and writings regarding salary, benefits, and compensation of any individual performing Public Records Request functions on behalf of the Grandview School District.\r\n2)\tAny/all records and writings referencing any software packages used in the search for and processing of Public Records Requests by the Grandview School District.\r\n\r\nWe were unable to locate any records responsive to #4 of your request. \r\n4)\tAny/all records and writings referencing any invoices for any legal work (including consulting and representation) performed on behalf of the Grandview School District in response to public records requests and/or public records act litigation.\r\n\r\nPer your request, you are seeking records for the period of January 01, 2020, through October 01, 2024.\r\n\r\nRegarding the records provided in response to item 2, similar to out interpretation of item 1, which we shared with you on November 5, 2025 in the District first installment, we have interpreted this request to be seeking a copy of the employment contracts and pay summaries of actual wages paid for the category of persons noted (\u201cany individual performing Public Records Request functions on behalf of the Grandview School District\u201d). Further, we have interpreted that category of persons just noted to mean: Grandview School District employee with a job responsibility of assisting the Grandview School District Public Records Officer with the identification of responsive public records and public records retrieval. For example, this would include the HR Specialist, whose job duties directly include assisting the PRO with tracking public records requests received by the District, but would exclude teachers, custodians, similarly situated staff who may, from time to time, be asked to search their personal files or emails for records responsive to a particular request, but who job duties do not regularly include public records activities. \r\n\r\nRegarding the records provided in response to item 3, we have interpreted this request to be seeking a copy of records that identify each of the software systems used by the District to search for and/or store records (that is, those software systems specifically purchased, contracted, or accessed for the purposes of complying with the District\u2019s records retention and public records responsibilities). Accordingly, please note that we do not interpret \u201csoftware packages used in the search for and processing of Public Records Requests\u201d to include any of the software that is routinely used to create individuals records (e.g., Microsoft Word, Adobe, district email systems used for the sending and receipt of email). Further, because we interpret your request to be seeking the identification of the above-described software packages, we are providing a copy of records of invoices paid and all service agreements and contracts for such software systems for the period in question to fulfill this request. One alternate interpretation of your request for \u201cany \u2026 records referencing any software packages used\u201d (emphasis added) would generate voluminous and duplicative records. For example, an email between two staff asking if one had observed whether an access feature in an identified software program was temporarily out-of-order could, under an alternative interpretation, be construed as a record \u201creferencing\u201d that software package. The District\u2019s interpretation will not yield these extraneous results. \r\n\r\nWe will require an additional 30 business days to create the next (expected final) installment of your request. The next installment will be provided on or before January 21st, 2026. \r\n\r\nRegarding the above, please notify us if we have mis-interpretated items 2 and 3 of your request.\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nJosie Chase \r\nHR Director \r\n5098828519\r\njachase@gsd200.org",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shared ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency received ALPR data in 2025;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information in 2025.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function.\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA.\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy.\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods June 5th, 2024 until the date of processing this request.\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce.\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2025.\r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2025.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed.  If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days.\r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from June 5th, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nB5. Average Daily Scans based on the past amount of days in which you retain data.\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations.\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and\r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a PDF below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records.\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set)\r\nPart D - Information Related to New Changes\r\nD1. Flock Safety has announced that they are building a product called Flock Nova, which combines information from agencies into one place, such as \u201cUnify CAD, RMS, video, LPR, and public records.\u201d It is mentioned in this article (https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/) that the tool is being used by some law enforcement agencies in an early access program (https://www.flocksafety.com/devices/flock-nova#:~:text=Flock%20Nova%20Early%20Access%20Now%20Open). Is/was your Agency part of, invited to, or booked a demo for the early access program? Is/has your Agency utilized Flock Nova? If yes, have you used the tool in any police investigations?\r\nD2. Please send a document of the most up-to-date ALPR policy that your Agency uses.\r\nPart E \u2013 Information Related to ALPR Camera Locations\r\nE1. The location (address, intersection, coordinates, or nearest landmark) of each ALPR camera operated, maintained, or accessed by the Agency as of the date of this request.\r\nE2. If your agency uses mobile ALPR cameras (e.g., on patrol cars), please indicate how many mobile units are currently deployed, and describe any policies that govern how locations of scans from mobile units are logged or stored.\r\nE3. If exact addresses or coordinates are withheld, please provide general placement descriptions (e.g., \"fixed camera at Main St & 2nd Ave,\" or \"mobile ALPR unit assigned to Northern District patrol vehicle\").\r\nThis information is typically accessible within ALPR system management software. For example:\r\n- In Flock Safety camera location information is visible through the camera dashboard and deployment maps.\r\n- In Vigilant/Motorola, camera locations are often listed in the device management or configuration settings.\r\nPart F - ALPR Vendor Contracts and Purchase Agreements\r\nF1. All contracts, purchase orders, service agreements, statements of work, or memoranda of understanding between the Agency and any vendor of ALPR technology (including Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions/Motorola, etc.) in effect during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF2. All invoices, receipts, and payment records related to the purchase, installation, operation, or maintenance of ALPR systems during January 1, 2024\u2013June 5, 2025. \r\nF3. Any grant applications or grant award documents (e.g., from DHS, DOJ, or private foundations) that funded or supported the acquisition or expansion of ALPR systems.\r\nPart G \u2013 Internal Communications and Rationale for Placement\r\nG1. Any internal memos, emails, reports, or presentations from 2022\u20132025 discussing where ALPR cameras should be placed or were ultimately placed. This includes communications from officers, command staff, city officials, or vendor representatives regarding:\r\n- Placement location recommendations\r\n- Crime statistics or justifications used to determine placement\r\n- Community concerns or opposition\r\n- Equity or privacy impacts\r\n- \u201cHigh crime\u201d area designations or related targeting rationale\r\nG2. Any communications with Flock Safety, Vigilant Solutions, or other ALPR vendors from 2022\u20132025 regarding camera placement, pilot programs, early access programs, or system expansion.\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request.\r\nPart H \u2013 ALPR Audit Logs & Access Records (More Detail)\r\nH1. A list of all ALPR database users employed by the Agency between June 5, 2024 and the present, including job titles, divisions, and access levels. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\nH2. Audit logs showing ALPR database access by Agency personnel from June 5, 2024 to the present. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.  Please include:\r\n1. Organization Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Organization Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches done within the agency.\r\n- Date and time of access\r\n- Name and Job Title of User\r\n- Search parameters (e.g., plate number or geographic query)\r\n- Stated reason for access, if logged\r\n2. Network Audit in Flock.\r\nThe report should include data logged from the period from the date above, to the date this request is processed. Per Flock's documentation, the Network Audit is available within the Insights tab and is defined as searches of the organization\u2019s Flock network by any agency in the Flock System.\r\nThese logs are required under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.90.52(a) and can help determine how often ALPR data is being queried and by whom. These records have been disclosed by several agencies in prior CPRA requests.\r\nIf the records responsive to any part of this request are held by another department, division, or city office (such as the Mayor\u2019s Office, Department of Technology, SFMTA, or a surveillance oversight board), please identify the appropriate custodian or refer this request accordingly, as required under Government Code \u00a7 6253.1.\r\nIn particular, if your agency does not maintain records related to:\r\n- The policy rationale or decision-making process for camera placement\r\n- Contracts or procurement related to ALPR vendors\r\n- Surveillance technology policy\r\nPlease inform me which department or office may hold these records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOmar Solis",

The search yielded the following results: ChatGPT \nTxDOT does not have a contract with ChatGPT and, so, the conversations will have to be pulled by the individual users if that user was logged in with a personal account. There was a total of 1,931 employees who used ChatGPT in the last 90 days and may be able to generate logs if they were using a personal account. TxDOT conducted a sample pull of one employee\u2019s conversations based on the parameters you provided. It took 15 min to pull the conversation and is estimated to take 483 hours in total to pull all of the conversations. CoPilot \nFor the past 90 days, a total of 15,807 users were discovered for CoPilot using TxDOT-issued devices. There were 4,761 TxDOT employee accounts who interacted with CoPilot, but only 4,527 TxDOT employee accounts had distinct conversations with CoPilot that could be pulled. This generated 136,664 distinct files that would require downloading and sanitization of HTML files so that they can be shared and viewable for the public. The remaining 11,000+ users either used a personal account or did not sign in at all, and TxDOT would need to conduct an agency-wide search to locate and produce this information by contacting every individual employee. \nTxDOT is able to provide the CloudAppEvents log, which will contain the interactions but not the actual prompts/responses, or general statistics of use without significant cost. However, if you still request the individual conversations TxDOT will proceed and will provide a cost estimate to produce these records. Based on the time it took to handle the ChatGPT log pull, TxDOT estimates 15-30 min per user to complete the task as written, but a sample pull will be done to finalize the estimate. Please confirm whether you want TxDOT to proceed with your request as written or if you wish to modify, narrow, or amend the request in any way to reduce the amount of information you have requested. \nIf you would like for TxDOT to proceed with your public information request, please provide clarifications within sixty-one (61) days from 11/18/2025. Otherwise, TxDOT will consider your request withdrawn. \nYou may provide a response to TxDOT by responding to this email. \nUpon receipt of your clarification, TxDOT will further respond to your Public Information Act Request as required by law, including providing you with an estimate of costs associated with producing the requested records. \nIf you have any questions, please reply to this email. Thank you for your attention to this matter. \nSincerely, \nJeffrey Hutson \n\nInformation Management \nTo monitor the progress or update this request please log into the TxDOT Records Request Center (https://u8387778.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.VEsWrlMiJDg0mXafq1mEXWtRp3aoWox5SVIqq7txaCtLZQ0y-2B7wlKD2RVwHHTlOtFi2DlIJlzxu0uDdx4osaTrB9v4XrdRLclxUUvsLUGrk-3D9zIX_zpBb0BT2bcGZXKgYNZjYBcbr6ZTkpVTLMl9wZaC2jNFNLoXjtIJHfb-2FucZAQGHjURs7RE0hIUuVJeplm18aV8Wd-2Fq7-2BYrL-2BsAdQE1qgmodkRZ2B6ixW7Li2jBNaAuGZGHD2yNcYsrp-2Fo3Mgbe-2FC-2FgpYQtuIL3OqdXaEFBiJ2Q-2Fi-2BJepqpOtQm2oNLVCqXmzx-2B2g7cyduNXLmhBPSnDCzWAHNzg6XAOWCwZkT-2Btdhx-2BAzbMFH2zpTgc8OEQiDx1k8JJjOVZFU3g-2BFmGDTjZQc5E5rimy5811F3r-2FBLKMT42QAYKG05QfDS7XJN5PA5AXWRwiD2ZdA-2Be5VoZkLj-2FQEwzjWlxTLiqfRJZTCyoLTnxjKpkgQo3Q-2B6SFYoZzufaoZ)\n",

Code Ann., Gen. Prov. (\u201cGP\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 4-101\u20134-601, on January 28, 2026, seeking the following information:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUse of force (UOF) data dating from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2025. If possible, please provide this data in database or spreadsheet format and include the case number, incident date, incident time, subject injured indicator, subject injury force related info (e.g. Yes or No), subject age, subject gender, subject ethnicity, subject weapon type, incident area occurred, force type, officer division (e.g. law enforcement operations, detention/correctional operations, etc.), badge number and names associated with the officers involved. If one or more of these fields or dates is unavailable, provide all fields and/or information that is available responsive to my request. If no database or spreadsheet format is available, please provide copies of each individual use of force report or other report where use of force information is documented/reported by officers. Note, this is for all use of force incidents reported by your agency, not limited to only those incidents required to be reported under state or federal programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached are the Use of Force reports from 2019 to 2024.&nbsp;These reports can also be found on our website located at www.firstsheriff.com.&nbsp;These reports do not include use of force by correction officers, this portion of your request has been denied as an agency is under no obligation to \u201ccreate, compile, or program a new public record\u201d to provide information sought by a requestor.GP \u00a7 4-205(c)(4)(iii).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not have this data in a spreadsheet format therefore this portion of your request has been denied as an agency is under no obligation to \u201ccreate, compile, or program a new public record\u201d to provide information sought by a requestor.&nbsp;GP \u00a7 4-205(c)(4)(iii).&nbsp;Your request to provide copies of each individual use of force report when there is no spreadsheet format available poses the dilemma of being an unreasonably large and broad request.&nbsp;Satisfying your request would place an undue burden upon our agency and would require such a diversion of resources and agency time as to amount to a huge expense.The Maryland Court of Appeals has had the occasion to observe that literal compliance with such an unreasonably broad request would \u201crequire such a diversion of resources and agency time as to amount to a huge expense.\u201d Glass v. Anne Arundel County, 453 Md. 201, 232-33 (2017). As a result, an agency that receives such an MPIA request does not have to \u201crobotically examine every record in its possession, running up an extravagant fee and diverting public resources in furtherance of a futile effort . . . .\u201d Id. at 232. In addition, \u201c[a]n agency is not expected to divert its resources to an exhaustive search in response to a broadly worded request that the requester refuses to focus and at an expense that will not be recovered.\u201d Id. at 233. Nor is an agency required to hire additional personnel to satisfy an MPIA request. Id. at 236 n.32. What the MPIA requires is a \u201creasonable search designed to locate all records responsive to the particular PIA request.\u201d Id. at 233 (emphasis in original). The \u201creasonableness\u201d of an agency\u2019s efforts to respond to a request will be \u201cmeasured against the specificity of the request and the willingness of the requestor to focus a request to improve the efficiency of the search.\u201d Id. \r\n\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInstead, the Court of Appeals recommends that \u201cif possible, an agency should in good faith provide some reasonable assistance to the requestor in refining the request for the records the requestor seeks.\u201d Id. at 232. In the event that the requestor refuses to refine the request, the Office of the Attorney General has construed the Glass decision and decisions of the Public Information Act Compliance Board to permit agencies to require prepayment of a fee before complying with such an unreasonably large and broad MPIA request. See Office of the Attorney General\u2019s Maryland Public Information Act Manual at 7-3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the manpower hours it would take to retrieve and enter all of the information is not within this agency\u2019s existing functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;An agency is under no obligation \u201cto create, compile, or program a new public record\u201d to provide information sought by a requestor. Gen. Prov. \u00a7 4-205(c)(4)(iii).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour request for the last 8 years of Use of Force reports from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2025, exceeds our retention schedule. Our 2025 Use of Force report will not be completed until the end of February 2026, and will be posted on our website at firstsheriff.com as soon as it is done.  You can download a copy as soon as it has been posted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that fee waivers will not be granted for large and broad MPIA requests and that prepayment of a fee will be required before complying with such requests in accordance with General Provision \u00a7 4-203(b).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to GP \u00a7 4-362, you are entitled to seek judicial review of this decision. You also have the option to refer any concerns about this decision to the Public Access Ombudsman pursuant to GP \u00a7 4-1B-01 et seq.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Use_of_Force_Report_2019.pdf\r\n\r\n* Use_of_Force_Report_2020.pdf\r\n\r\n* Use_of_Force_Report_2021.pdf\r\n\r\n* Use_of_Force_Report_2022.pdf\r\n\r\n* Use_of_Force_Report_2023.pdf\r\n\r\n* Use_of_Force_Report_2024.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDocument links are valid for one month.\r\n                   After March 2, you will need to sign in to view the document(s).\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.civicplus.help/nextrequest/docs/requesters\">help page</a>",

Soon we will provide you with one or more of the following:  \r\n  *  Copies of the requested public records. \r\n  *  A statement concerning our inability to locate any public records meeting the terms of your request. \r\n  *  A request for additional clarification concerning the types of records or information you are seeking. Record requests that can be provided with less than one hour of staff time will not be billed for labor. If we determine that our office possesses the public records you request, but are voluminous, difficult to locate, and/or contain information that may include open and closed information, we will provide you with a written estimate of the fees that we will require be pre-paid in order to pay for the actual costs associated with (a) locating and/or retrieving the public records from storage, (b) staff time spent in assisting with making copies of the records, including staff time spent examining the records for possible closure and/or redaction, and (c) copying and mailing the requested public records. In addition to billing for labor that exceed one hour of staff time, the following rates shall apply: \r\n \r\n Copies, 25 cents per page after 100 pages \r\n Staff time will be charged at the rate of pay for each person whose time is used in order to assist and/or respond to a specific request.

For the purpose of transparency, our rates are as follows: general staff time will be charged at $20 per hour, and information technology (IT) services and Legal staff services will be charged at $38 per hour. \r\n Additional fees may be assessed if any other costs are incurred by KDOC in connection with complying with a record request. KDOC will provide an estimate of the fees which shall be paid prior to the department gathering the records. In order to ensure payment, the final cost of providing access to or furnishing copies must be paid before the records are provided. If the final cost is less than the estimate, the requestor will be reimbursed for the difference. 5. If we determine that we do possess the records, but that the records are subject to closure by law, we will provide you with that information with a written citation to the laws allowing or requiring that type of public record to be closed.",

Gen. Furness for the attrition rates of first-year cadets. Lt. Gen. Furness provided some for the current year but stated he did not have previous years available to him at the meeting but indicated he could easily provide them later.\r\n\r\nWhereas this information is available (per Lt. Gen. Furness) and he will be providing it to Senator Deeds quickly as he indicated, I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\n1. The attrition for first-year cadets, by year, 2019 to present.\r\n2. Breakout of that by-year data by race, gender, athlete and non-athlete.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

What does \"FL\" stand for?\r\n\r\n5. I see the FL ranges from 2019 to 2024.  Assuming these are the equivolent of matriculation dates then FL 2024 would be the Freshman class that matriculated in August 2024. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nIf so, I asked for the data \"to the present\" that should include August 2025 with the Retained and Non-Re-tained to date.

        "communication": "I greatly appreciate your taking the time to send me this response. I respectfully appeal the denial of my Freedom of Information Act request for records generated by or related to the use of Flock Safety automated license plate reader (ALPR) systems. \r\n\r\nTo clarify, the documents that I am requesting need not include any captured plate data and are therefore not exempt under \u00a7 20-183.32. The spreadsheet column containing license plate data could simply be redacted or deleted.\r\n\r\nThe denial also cites exemption \u201c(4) Specific security information or detailed plans, patterns, or practices to prevent or respond to criminal, gang, or organized illegal activity.\u201d This exemption does not justify a blanket withholding of the requested records for the reasons explained below.\r\n\r\n1. The requested records are observational data, not security plans or tactics\r\n\r\nALPR records consist of images of license plates, time stamps, and general location data captured passively in public spaces. Courts have consistently held that records documenting what the government observes in public do not constitute sensitive security plans, tactics, or operational details merely because the data may later be used in law enforcement investigations.\r\n\r\nMy request does not seek:\r\n\r\n- System configurations, camera placement strategies, or technical vulnerabilities\r\n- Real-time access to ALPR feeds\r\n- Tactical deployment plans or investigative methodologies\r\n\r\nInstead, it seeks historical records already collected, which do not reveal how the agency prevents or responds to criminal activity.\r\n\r\n2. The exemption must be narrowly construed and cannot support categorical denial\r\n\r\nFOIA exemptions are to be narrowly construed, and the agency bears the burden of demonstrating that disclosure would reasonably be expected to cause harm protected by the exemption. A generalized assertion that ALPR data relates to crime prevention is insufficient.\r\n\r\nIf the mere fact that data could be used for law enforcement were enough to trigger this exemption, then virtually all records held by law enforcement agencies would be categorically exempt\u2014an outcome inconsistent with the purpose and letter of FOIA.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of historical ALPR data does not compromise security\r\n\r\nThe requested records are historical in nature. Disclosure of past ALPR captures does not reveal current patrol patterns, response protocols, or vulnerabilities. Numerous jurisdictions release ALPR data in redacted form without compromising public safety, demonstrating that disclosure can be accomplished responsibly.\r\n\r\n4. FOIA requires segregation and partial disclosure\r\n\r\nEven if the agency believes that limited portions of the requested records could implicate protected security information, FOIA requires that all reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions be released. The denial does not identify any attempt to segregate or redact sensitive fields (e.g., investigative notes, active case identifiers) while releasing the remaining data.\r\n\r\nA blanket denial without a segregability analysis violates FOIA\u2019s statutory requirements.\r\n\r\n5. Strong public interest in ALPR transparency\r\n\r\nThere is a significant public interest in understanding how ALPR technology is used, retained, shared, and accessed\u2014particularly given its implications for privacy, civil liberties, and potential misuse. Transparency regarding the scope and scale of ALPR collection enhances public trust and accountability without impeding legitimate law enforcement functions.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the cited exemption does not justify withholding the requested Flock ALPR records in their entirety. I respectfully request that the agency: 1) Reconsider its denial; 2) Conduct a proper segregability analysis; and 3) Release all non-exempt portions of the requested records, with narrowly tailored redactions if necessary.\r\n\r\nIf the denial is upheld, please provide a detailed explanation of how each withheld category of records specifically meets the claimed exemption, as required by FOIA.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this appeal.",

A copy of any document sufficient to show the most recent training conducted for law-enforcement officers in your agency with respect to any of the subjects in (1).

While the Department provided a copy of an Attorney General letter ruling from 2018, it's unclear how that ruling bears on the instant request. To the contrary, the ruling suggests that records of Department policies and manuals are not per se confidential. Further, it's unclear how a ruling about a given manual relates to the instant request, which presumably seeks different records.\r\n\r\nPlease advise.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

Additionally, because the Chesterfield County Sheriff's Office is not the primary Law Enforcement agency in Chesterfield, \"uses of force\" are generally situations arising out of the Chesterfield County Jail, in the Courthouse, etc.\u00a0 Our office tracks all levels of force by an individual, whether that individual is a deputy, a citizen or an inmate, however, the system does not track which individual used the force in question. Thank you",

Specifically, I am requesting: \r\n- Documentation of the amount of funds the city has received from the federal opioid lawsuit settlements\r\n- The application forms that any organization would submit to receive settlement funds\r\n- Documentation of how much city-level funding has been awarded as of March 1, 2025, and to whom it was awarded\r\n- Any completed application of an organization that has received settlement funds from the city\r\n- Documentation of the process by which funds are awarded\r\n- Any documents that contain the names of the individuals who review the funding applications and determine the awards\r\n- Any documents that account for future plans from the city for the use of opioid settlement funds\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $25. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of how the opioid settlement funds are being spent. I am a student journalist whose request is strictly for news-gathering purposes. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. \r\nThe West Virginia Freedom of Information Act requires a response to this request be made within five business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records. \r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law. \r\nThank you for considering my request. \r\n\r\nSincerely, Jessica Riley \r\n330-978-8228\r\njlr00026@mix.wvu.edu",
