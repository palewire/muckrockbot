The incident involved several wrestlers and staff members of the WWE who were traveling on a chartered flight from London to the United States.\r\n\r\nAs you may be aware, the incident became chaotic and resulted in allegations of sexual assault, harassment, and other inappropriate behavior. These allegations were made public in a recent \"Dark Side of the Ring\" documentary by Vice, which has raised serious concerns about the safety and well-being of those involved. I have attached a copy of this article to this request for your reference.\r\n\r\nAs a concerned citizen and journalist, I believe it is important to understand the full extent of this incident and any related investigations that may have taken place. Therefore, I request access to any and all records related to this incident, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\nAny FBI investigation or inquiry into the incident\r\nWitness statements and interviews conducted by the FBI or other law enforcement agencies\r\nCorrespondence between the FBI and the WWE or its employees regarding the incident\r\nAny reports or memoranda created as a result of the investigation\r\nAny other documents or information related to the incident or any subsequent investigations\r\nAny other incidents involving the WWE/WWF and allegations of sexual misconduct or inappropriate behavior\r\nAny other investigations conducted by the FBI into the WWE/WWF or its employees\r\nIn addition, I request that the FBI conduct an interagency search for any records that may be in the possession of other government agencies, such as the Department of Justice or the Department of Transportation.\r\n\r\nI advise the FBI not to delete, redact, or withhold any responsive records. If any responsive records are withheld, redacted, or destroyed, I reserve the right to file a complaint and take legal action to compel the release of these records.\r\n\r\nIn support of this request, I refer you to the following court cases:\r\n\r\nFederal Open Market Committee v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340 (1979): Agencies cannot withhold records under FOIA merely because they consider them confidential. The agency must show that the information is actually exempt under one of the nine statutory exemptions.\r\nFBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615 (1982): Agencies cannot rely on a \"mosaic theory\" of withholding, where they argue that release of some information, in combination with other publicly available information, would reveal sensitive information.\r\nWashington Post Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252 (D.C. Cir. 1982): Agencies cannot withhold documents simply because they contain both exempt and non-exempt material. Rather, the agency must segregate and release the non-exempt material.\r\nFurthermore, I request that any redactions made to the records be kept to a minimum and that any exemptions claimed by the FBI be explained in detail.\r\n\r\nTo help facilitate the search for these records, I provide the following keystring search terms:\r\n\r\nWWE plane incident\r\nFlight from Hell\r\nSexual assault allegations WWE\r\nFBI investigation WWE\r\nWWE misconduct investigation\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

        "communication": "Re: FOIA Appeal for Request No.: 1589912-000\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Appeal Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing to appeal the FBI's response to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, dated April 17th 2023. My request sought records pertaining to the World Wrestling Entertainment plane incident on May 5, 2002. The response I received on April 24, 2023, stated that no records responsive to my request were found after conducting a main entity record search of the Central Records System (CRS) following their standard search policy.\r\n\r\nI believe that the search conducted by the FBI was inadequate and failed to include necessary interagency exchange and communication that would have revealed the requested information. I assert that the FBI should have communicated with other relevant agencies involved in the investigation of the incident to obtain any responsive records.\r\n\r\nI kindly request a more thorough search for responsive documents, including but not limited to interagency exchanges, communications, and any existing court cases related to the incident. As a matter of public interest, this information will contribute significantly to the public's understanding of the federal government's investigation into the incident and ensure transparency.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I request that this appeal be processed on an expedited basis. As mentioned earlier, the information requested is of great public interest, and timely access to this information is crucial for the public's understanding of the incident and any related investigations.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I respectfully request that the FBI conduct an immediate and thorough search for responsive documents to my request and reconsider their initial decision to close the request. Should you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this appeal.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative\r\n    of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for\r\n    which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    \r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    files relating to or mentioning the following companies:\r\n    \r\n    Infotechnology\r\n    Biotech Capital\r\n    Biotech\r\n    Financial News Network\r\n    United Press International\r\n    \r\n    Please include but do not limit the response to materials relating to Earl\r\n    Brian's June, 1993 settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on\r\n    charges of inflating Financial News Network's revenues by millions of\r\n    dollars.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Good Morning Ms. Best ,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIPA request made for records concerning Financial News Network.  The FBI located approximately 7,015 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.  \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, we would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  If you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nThe current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 56 months. \r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-4894.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov\r\n540-868-4894",

        "communication": "Good afternoon Siobhan.  I am in receipt of your Right to Know request.  In New Hampshire we have two types of medical and residential facilities: those that are licensed only and those that are both licensed and certified.  Certified means that the facility is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to participate in those programs.  Examples of facilities that are licensed only include Residential Care Facilities, Supported Residential Health Care Facilities and Walk-in Care Facilities.  In other words, these are facilities that do not receive reimbursement from CMS.  Examples of facilities that are both licensed and certified include Hospitals, Nursing homes and most Ambulatory Surgical Centers.  Information relative to fines imposed against facilities that are licensed only is confidential under RSA 151:13 and is exempt from disclosure under RSA 91-A:5,IV.  RSA 151:13 reads as follows:\r\n\r\n 151:13 Information Confidential. \u2013 Information received or created by the department of health and human services, through inspection or otherwise, authorized hereunder shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed publicly except in a proceeding involving the question of licensure or revocation of license pursuant to RSA 541-A. The department may disclose such information after it denies, suspends or revokes a license pursuant to RSA 151:7, II.\r\n\r\nDHHS does not impose fines against facilities that are certified.  Rather it is CMS that does that.  For the above reasons, your Right to Know request is denied due to the fact that DHHS does not have any public records that are responsive to your request.  Below is a link to the Enforcement Actions page of the CMS website.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnforcement Actions | CMS<https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency/enforcement-actions>\r\nPart C and Part D Enforcement Actions | CMS<https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Compliance-and-Audits/Part-C-and-Part-D-Compliance-and-Audits/PartCandPartDEnforcementActions->\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn B.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

No official format is\r\nrequired for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that\r\nrequestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records\r\nrequest will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested\r\nor relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic\r\nformat. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create\r\nnew records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and\r\nre-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in\r\nelectronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in\r\nadvance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions\r\nof the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of\r\nidentified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an\r\nagency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must\r\ninform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief\r\nexplanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld.\r\nRCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the\r\nstatute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief\r\nexplanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a\r\nthreshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global,\r\nnonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way\r\nto properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction\r\nis for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of\r\nrecord, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the\r\nrecord (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should\r\nallow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency\r\nhas properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the\r\nFERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public\r\nrecords citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record,\r\nproperly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record\r\ndescription and page count or record length, will be challenged in\r\naccordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or\r\nexemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the\r\nproduction of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed\r\nexemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each\r\nredaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number\r\nof pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety.\r\nEach redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the\r\nspecific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt\r\nportion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists\r\nof individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this\r\npublic records request is not being made for any commercial purpose\r\nwhatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list\r\nof individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56\r\nregarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional\r\ncommercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests\r\nreceived by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of\r\nyour agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the\r\nyear 2022.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year\r\n2022 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for\r\ncommunication and production of records in response to a public records\r\nrequest is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington.\r\nRespectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically\r\nGOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct\r\nemail attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based\r\ndownload link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with\r\nyour agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to\r\nFOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm,\r\nor any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of\r\npublic records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's\r\nnormal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records\r\nunless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is\r\nrequired for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that\r\nrequestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records\r\nrequest will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested\r\nor relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic\r\nformat. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create\r\nnew records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and\r\nre-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in\r\nelectronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in\r\nadvance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions\r\nof the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of\r\nidentified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an\r\nagency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must\r\ninform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief\r\nexplanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld.\r\nRCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the\r\nstatute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief\r\nexplanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a\r\nthreshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global,\r\nnonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way\r\nto properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction\r\nis for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of\r\nrecord, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the\r\nrecord (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should\r\nallow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency\r\nhas properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the\r\nFERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public\r\nrecords citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record,\r\nproperly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record\r\ndescription and page count or record length, will be challenged in\r\naccordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or\r\nexemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the\r\nproduction of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed\r\nexemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each\r\nredaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number\r\nof pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety.\r\nEach redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the\r\nspecific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt\r\nportion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists\r\nof individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this\r\npublic records request is not being made for any commercial purpose\r\nwhatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list\r\nof individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56\r\nregarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional\r\ncommercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We\r\nlook forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business\r\ndays, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fvancouver-public-schools-district-29069%252Fvancouver-public-schools-district-2022-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-the-district-responses-for-the-year-2022-139891%252F%253Femail%253DMarilee.Scarbrough%252540vansd.org&url_auth_token=AAEh5OaS2ERsb3M73crdcFQyLFc%3A1prNlV%3ARGf-DHHdqogAx-OztdFiIBtKt_sPiKWYB-TARfK2RMQ\r\n\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nGAGHCGJY\r\n\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 139891-20020258@requests.muckrock.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 139891\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This request is not filed by a MuckRock staff member, but is\r\nbeing sent through MuckRock by the above in order to better track, share,\r\nand manage public records requests.

The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021.\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department\r\nAuburn Police Department\r\nBakersfield Police Department\r\nBeaumont Police Department\r\nBell Gardens Police Department\r\nBell Police Department\r\nBelvedere Police Department\r\nBeverly Hills Police Department\r\nBrawley Police Department\r\nBrentwood Police Department\r\nBuena Park Police Department\r\nBurbank Police Department\r\nCarlsbad Police Department\r\nCathedral City Police Department\r\nChino Police Department\r\nChula Vista Police Department\r\nCitrus Heights Police Department\r\nClaremont Police Department\r\nClayton Police Department\r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office\r\nCoronado Police Department\r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department\r\nCypress Police Department\r\nEl Segundo Police Department\r\nFairfield Police Department\r\nFolsom Police Department\r\nFontana Police Department\r\nFresno Police Department\r\nFullerton Police Department\r\nGalt Police Department\r\nGarden Grove Police Department\r\nGardena Police Department\r\nGlendale Police Department\r\nHemet Police Department\r\nHermosa Beach Police Department\r\nImperial Police Department\r\nIrvine Police Department\r\nLa Habra Police Department\r\nLa Mesa Police Department\r\nLa Verne Police Department\r\nLaguna Beach Police Department\r\nLivermore Police Department\r\nLodi Police Department\r\nLong Beach Police Department\r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office\r\nMartinez Police Department\r\nMerced Police Department\r\nMill Valley Police Department\r\nModesto Police Department\r\nMonterey Park Police Department\r\nNewport Beach Police Department\r\nOakley Police Department\r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office\r\nOrange Police Department\r\nPalm Springs Police Department\r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police\r\nPasadena Police Department\r\nPleasant Hill Police Department\r\nPomona Police Department\r\nRedlands Police Department\r\nRedondo Beach Police Department\r\nRipon Police Department\r\nRoseville Police Department\r\nSalinas Police Department\r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office\r\nSan Diego Police Department\r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office\r\nSausalito Police Department\r\nSimi Valley Police Department\r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office\r\nStockton Police Department\r\nTiburon Police Department\r\nTorrance Police Department\r\nTracy Police Department\r\nTustin Police Department\r\nWest Sacramento Police Department\r\nWestminster Police Department\r\nWoodland Police Department\r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office\r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n\r\n \r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of November 03, 2022, Reference # P002752-110322. \r\nDear Dave Maass, \r\n\r\nThe Livermore Police Department received the following request from you on November 03, 2022. \r\nYou requested the following: Dear Custodian of Records: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data; \r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data; \r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information; \r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information. \r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021. \r\nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021. \r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software. \r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act \r\n\r\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist. \r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought. \r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nAmerican Canyon Police Department \r\nAuburn Police Department \r\nBakersfield Police Department \r\nBeaumont Police Department \r\nBell Gardens Police Department \r\nBell Police Department \r\nBelvedere Police Department \r\nBeverly Hills Police Department \r\nBrawley Police Department \r\nBrentwood Police Department \r\nBuena Park Police Department \r\nBurbank Police Department \r\nCarlsbad Police Department \r\nCathedral City Police Department \r\nChino Police Department \r\nChula Vista Police Department \r\nCitrus Heights Police Department \r\nClaremont Police Department \r\nClayton Police Department \r\nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office \r\nCoronado Police Department \r\nCSU Fullerton Police Department \r\nCypress Police Department \r\nEl Segundo Police Department \r\nFairfield Police Department \r\nFolsom Police Department \r\nFontana Police Department \r\nFresno Police Department \r\nFullerton Police Department \r\nGalt Police Department \r\nGarden Grove Police Department \r\nGardena Police Department \r\nGlendale Police Department \r\nHemet Police Department \r\nHermosa Beach Police Department \r\nImperial Police Department \r\nIrvine Police Department \r\nLa Habra Police Department \r\nLa Mesa Police Department \r\nLa Verne Police Department \r\nLaguna Beach Police Department \r\nLivermore Police Department \r\nLodi Police Department \r\nLong Beach Police Department \r\nMarin County Sheriff's Office \r\nMartinez Police Department \r\nMerced Police Department \r\nMill Valley Police Department \r\nModesto Police Department \r\nMonterey Park Police Department \r\nNewport Beach Police Department \r\nOakley Police Department \r\nOrange County Sheriff's Office \r\nOrange Police Department \r\nPalm Springs Police Department \r\nPalos Verdes Estates Police \r\nPasadena Police Department \r\nPleasant Hill Police Department \r\nPomona Police Department \r\nRedlands Police Department \r\nRedondo Beach Police Department \r\nRipon Police Department \r\nRoseville Police Department \r\nSalinas Police Department \r\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office \r\nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office \r\nSan Diego Police Department \r\nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office \r\nSausalito Police Department \r\nSimi Valley Police Department \r\nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office \r\nStockton Police Department \r\nTiburon Police Department \r\nTorrance Police Department \r\nTracy Police Department \r\nTustin Police Department \r\nWest Sacramento Police Department \r\nWestminster Police Department \r\nWoodland Police Department \r\nYolo County Sheriff's Office \r\n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request.

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \n\n \nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of November 03, 2022, Reference # P002752-110322. \nDear Dave Maass, \n\nThe Livermore Police Department received the following request from you on November 03, 2022. \nYou requested the following: Dear Custodian of Records: \n\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \n\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\"). \n\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing. \n\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data; \nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data; \nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information; \nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information. \nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. \n\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \n\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records: \n\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data. \nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \n\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \n\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist) \n\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2021. \nB2. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2021. \nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \nB4. The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2022 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. \n\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality. As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software. \n\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \n\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act \n\nC1. A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist. \nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought. \n\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a list below with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \n\nAmerican Canyon Police Department \nAuburn Police Department \nBakersfield Police Department \nBeaumont Police Department \nBell Gardens Police Department \nBell Police Department \nBelvedere Police Department \nBeverly Hills Police Department \nBrawley Police Department \nBrentwood Police Department \nBuena Park Police Department \nBurbank Police Department \nCarlsbad Police Department \nCathedral City Police Department \nChino Police Department \nChula Vista Police Department \nCitrus Heights Police Department \nClaremont Police Department \nClayton Police Department \nContra Costa County Sheriff's Office \nCoronado Police Department \nCSU Fullerton Police Department \nCypress Police Department \nEl Segundo Police Department \nFairfield Police Department \nFolsom Police Department \nFontana Police Department \nFresno Police Department \nFullerton Police Department \nGalt Police Department \nGarden Grove Police Department \nGardena Police Department \nGlendale Police Department \nHemet Police Department \nHermosa Beach Police Department \nImperial Police Department \nIrvine Police Department \nLa Habra Police Department \nLa Mesa Police Department \nLa Verne Police Department \nLaguna Beach Police Department \nLivermore Police Department \nLodi Police Department \nLong Beach Police Department \nMarin County Sheriff's Office \nMartinez Police Department \nMerced Police Department \nMill Valley Police Department \nModesto Police Department \nMonterey Park Police Department \nNewport Beach Police Department \nOakley Police Department \nOrange County Sheriff's Office \nOrange Police Department \nPalm Springs Police Department \nPalos Verdes Estates Police \nPasadena Police Department \nPleasant Hill Police Department \nPomona Police Department \nRedlands Police Department \nRedondo Beach Police Department \nRipon Police Department \nRoseville Police Department \nSalinas Police Department \nSan Bernardino County Sheriff's Office \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Office \nSan Diego Police Department \nSan Mateo County Sheriff's Office \nSausalito Police Department \nSimi Valley Police Department \nStanislaus County Sheriff's Office \nStockton Police Department \nTiburon Police Department \nTorrance Police Department \nTracy Police Department \nTustin Police Department \nWest Sacramento Police Department \nWestminster Police Department \nWoodland Police Department \nYolo County Sheriff's Office \n(This URL links to a dataset with links to the records: https://www.eff.org/document/data-driven-2-california-dragnet-data-set ) \n\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \n\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \n\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \n\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs. \n\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109. \n\nSincerely, \n\nDave Maass \nDirector of Investigations \nElectronic Frontier Foundation \n\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Flivermore-police-department-12041%252Fautomated-license-plate-readers-livermore-police-department-136251%252F%253Femail%253DJMichelson%252540cityoflivermore.net&url_auth_token=AABABtJPsOSHYSnW2J2nT6CmtDU%3A1oqmGT%3AoC9lNJ3e83aNI5WOpP9AFrR6lQ7Hji6J7QVfMX4mAVg \nResponsive records are available on the Records Request Portal.

A copy of the Request is attached to this Letter as \"Appendix A\".\r\n\r\nOn 10/20/2022, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Acknowledged receiving my FOIA Request on 10/18/2022 and reported the following Tracking Numbers for it: 23-00135-F, 23-00499-F, 23-00566-F, 23-00567-F, 23-00568-F, 23-00569-F, 23-00570-F.  Veterans Health Administration stated in that Acknowledgement that the Requested Records, if they exist, will be maintained by Veterans Health Administration; as well as other divisions of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, including the VA Office of the Inspector General, all of which VHA is coordinating with to satisfy the Request.  A copy of VHA's 10/20/2022 Acknowledgement is attached to this Letter within \"Appendix A\".\r\n\r\nOn 11/17/2022, I received an \"Agency Final Response\" to my FOIA Request from Government Information Specialist Barya Offer, on behalf of the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  The sum of Offer's purported \"Agency Final Response\" is, \"please see the Agency Final Response regarding your request\"; with an attached PDF file named \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial.pdf\".  Said file is a letter from Supervisory Government Information Specialist Ruthhee G. Bellamy of the VA OIG Release Information Office - notifying me that VA OIG assigned Tracking Number 23-00006-FOIA to my Request, among other things.  A copy of VHA's 11/17/2022 \"Agency Final Response\" is included in the \"Appendix A\" attachment to this Letter.\r\n\r\nThe \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial\" letter from VA OIG on 11/17/2022 is attached to this Letter as \"Appendix B\"; and declares \"we were unable to locate any responsive records pertaining to your request\"; yet only as the Request pertains to Inspector General Michael J. Missal in VA OIG Records.  Unfortunately, VA OIG's Response to my Request is a false statement of fact; provable by one of many Records in my possession which would have to be included in any satisfactory Response to my Request, notwithstanding whether that Response is from VA OIG, VHA or otherwise applicable officse / divisions of US DVA.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned Record in my possession is an e-mail I sent to Inspector General Missal and others on 05/27/2022 regarding VCOEB, that a simple search for the text \"VCOEB\" will produce upon querying Inspector General Missal's e-mail correspondence between 05/01/2022 and Present.  Given that e-mail was not returned to sender and Inspector General Missal directly corresponded with me several times in the recent past from the same e-mail address; and because information about a Federal Advisory Committee that holds Public Meetings in Open Session on Public land for Public attendance (as Publicly Noticed in the Federal Register), is not qualified to be suppressed due limited National Security provisions under 5 U.S.C. Statutes governing FOIA - apparently the minimum effort to satisfactorily Respond to my Request is beyond some U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Officials' intent to perform...  Despite VA OIG's purported \"Agency Final Response No Records - Full Denial\" Letter probably cost Federal Taxpayer's far more to produce than performing the simple searches to lawfully satisfy and Respond to my Request will; presuming Public Records required to satisfy my Request were not unlawfully tampered with. Even in that hypothetical scenario though, the Records are obtainable from one of many archives US DVA is Mandated to retain as National Security against the tampering or loss of such Records.  A copy of my aforementioned 05/27/2022 e-mail to Inspector General Missal and one of many e-mails Inspector General Missal sent me from the same address he received my 05/27/2020 e-mail at, are attached to this Letter as \"Appendix C\".\r\nNotwithstanding the validity or lack thereof in VA OIG's Response to a portion of my Request through VHA, the partial Response is not a legitimate, full Response to my Request; despite it being uncannily misrepresented as such by false statements of fact.\r\n\r\nThe Agency is at least procedurally failing to Respond to my Request on time in accordance with Federal Public Law.  I reassure you the Requested Records regarding a Federal Advisory Committee with a Public Law Mandate and Charter to improve outcomes for Veterans via Public Meetings held in Open Session here in Our Nation's Capital of Veteran Homelessness - are delays of Public Records offering a direct positive impact on disabled homeless Veterans' probability of survival and General Welfare of U.S. Taxpayers  Contrarily, the ongoing and baseless delays Responding to my Request are negatively impacting disabled homeless Veterans and Federal Taxpayers, until and unless the Request is fully and legitimately Responded to.\r\n\r\nGiven my maintained Good Faith in the majority of Our U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Staff's Public Integrity and capacity to ethically perform their duties in accordance with the Department's true Mission - I expect nothing less than the People of the United States of America do in this matter; a swift, comprehensive, accurate and satisfactory Response to my Request in accordance with Our Rights, Public Laws and increasing expenditures to expect no less of Our U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' performance in respect thereof.\r\n\r\nI declare under under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Organizations wishing to participate in the mobility program must first submit request for certification packets to the agency with which they seek to partner. Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nOverview\r\nThis seeks DHS-OIG agency records regarding Contractor Notifications to the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General that are required by 48 C.F.R. 52.222-50(d)(1) and (2), as incorporated by contract, regarding allegations of forced labor at civil immigration detention facilities operated by contractors of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These Contractor Notifications are required by federal law when the contractor receives credible information regarding violations of the forced labor provisions of the TVPA, 18 U.S.C. 1589, including those arising from alleged forced labor. See 48 C.F.R. 52.222-50(b)(3). The Contractor Notification requirement is incorporated into every federal detention contract at issue in this request as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nSince the Contractor Notification regulations took effect, ICE's two largest federal government detention contractors - CoreCivic, Inc. and The GEO Group, Inc. - have been found by federal courts to have plausibly engaged in forced labor violations at nearly all of their facilities nationwide. See Owino v. CoreCivic, Inc., No. 17-cv-1112, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58268 (S.D. Cal. 2020) (certifying a nationwide forced labor class for CoreCivic's civil immigration detention facilities), Novoa v. The GEO Group, Inc., No. 5:17-cv-2514-JGB-SHK, Dkt. No. 223 (C.D. Cal. 2019) (certifying a nationwide forced labor class for most of GEO's civil immigration detention facilities) available at https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-CA-0142-0006.pdf. In addition, federal judges in five separate U.S. district courts have denied efforts by these contractors to dismiss TVPA forced labor claims raised by current or former ICE detainees. See Owino v. CoreCivic, Inc., 2018 WL 2193644 (S.D. Cal. May 14, 2018); Gonzalez v. CoreCivic, Inc., No. 1:18-cv-169 (W.D. Tex. Feb. 22, 2018), ECF No. 29 (Order Denying Motion to Dismiss), at 4-5; Novoa v. GEO Grp., Inc., EDCV 17-2514 (SHKx), 2018 WL 3343494 (C.D. Cal. June 21, 2018) (same); Menocal v. Geo Grp., Inc., 113 F. Supp. 3d 1125, 1131-33 (D. Colo. 2015) (same). \r\n\r\nTogether, CoreCivic and GEO house up to 60% of the civilly detained immigrants held by ICE on any given day, and receive the majority of federal immigration detention contract funds appropriated by Congress. Their market share in these contracts, and ICE's Congressionally-appropriate total number of detention beds more broadly, has grown approximately 50% in the past 3 1/2 years. Yet neither ICE's Contracting Officers nor DHS-OIG appear to have taken any of the actions required by law. See 48 C.F.R. 52.222-50(g). \r\n\r\nIn 2019, the Solicitor General of the United States informed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Barrientos v. CoreCivic, Inc., No. 18-15081. 951 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2020), that ICE and the DOJ consider the forced labor provisions to apply to private detention contractors' work programs, and opined that where those contractors violate ICE's contractually binding Performance-Based National Detention StandardsPreviously (PBNDS). The Solicitor General's Amicus Brief in support of neither party specifically referenced the Executive Order which gave rise to the insertion of the Contractor Notification requirement into the Federal Acquisition Regulations for all domestic federal contracts. See Strengthening Protections Against Trafficking in Persons in Federal Contracts, 77 Fed. Reg. 600029, 60030 (\"Sec. 2. Anti-Trafficking Provisions. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Administrator for the United States Agency for International Development, and the heads of such other executive departments and agencies (agencies) as the FAR Council determines to be appropriate, shall take steps necessary to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to:\r\n(1) strengthen the efficacy of the Government\u2019s zero-tolerance policy on trafficking in persons by Federal contractors and subcontractors in solicitations, contracts, and subcontracts for supplies or services (including construction and commercial items), by: . . . (C) requiring contracting officers to notify, in accordance with agency procedures, the agency\u2019s Inspector General, the agency official responsible for initiating suspension or debarment actions, and law enforcement, if appropriate, if they become aware of any activities that would justify termination under section 106(g) of the TVPA, 22 U.S.C. 7104(g), or are inconsistent with the requirements of this order or any other applicable law or regulation establishing restrictions on trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor, and further requiring that the agency official responsible for initiating suspension and debarment actions consider whether suspension or debarment is necessary in order to protect the Government\u2019s interest[.])\" I\r\n\r\nPreviously, the Office of Inspector General faulted ICE for failing to adequately oversee some DHS contracts: https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2019-07/OIG-19-50-Jul19.pdf, and for failing to use available contracting tools to achieve compliance with the PBNDS: https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2019-02/OIG-19-18-Jan19.pdf. \r\n\r\nIn 2017, DHS-OIG specifically notified ICE that the policies of requiring immigrant detainees to clean common living areas for no remuneration, as opposed to their immediate living areas, violates the PBNDS: https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2017/OIG-17-43-MA-030617.pdf at p. 6 (\" Additionally, requiring detainees to clean common areas used by all detainees is in violation of ICE standards, as detainees are only required to clean their immediate living area.\"). ICE concurred with all three OIG recommendations in that report, and committed to resolving them.\r\n\r\nDescription of Records Requested\r\n1. All Contractor Notifications to DHS-OIG from any ICE contractor, including, but not limited to, The GEO Group, Inc. and CoreCivic, Inc., regarding credible information that its agents have engaged in forced labor violations. \r\n2. All DHS-OIG agency records received pursuant to 48 C.F.R. 52-222-50(g).\r\n3. All DHS-OIG agency records pertaining to any actions taken upon receiving such Contractor Notifications. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.4(b), we request records that should have been received by DHS-OIG from GEO at the time the Menocal v. The GEO Group, Inc. litigation was filed in the District of Colorado on October 22, 2014, or, at the very least after the District of Colorado ruled the allegations in Menocal of forced labor violations were plausible in 2015. The same dates of receipt corresponding to the filing and district court decision dates of the Owino, Gonzalez, and Novoa class actions should be used to formulate the search. It is believed that OIG _MAY_ have been forwarded these notifications by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Office of Acquisition Management (OAQ) Contracting Officer for each relevant contract. However, because the binding regulation requires direct notification to DHS-OIG, we believe there should be records received by OIG directly from the contractors themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nPursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(iv), I request expedited processing of this request. The issue of DHS contractors' alleged use of forced labor in ICE's civil immigration detention facilities has been the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest, and there are significant questions regarding ICE and OIG's responses to those allegations which affect public confidence. \r\n\r\n A representative sampling of the media stories we rely upon for the proposition that these allegations have been the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest follows: \r\n1. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/05/thousands-of-ice-detainees-claim-they-were-forced-into-labor-a-violation-of-anti-slavery-laws/\r\n2. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/opinion/forced-labor-immigrants.html\r\n3. https://www.westword.com/news/geo-lawsuit-alleging-forced-labor-of-immigrant-detainees-moves-forward-6886851\r\n4. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/25/private-prison-companies-served-with-lawsuits-over-usng-detainee-labor\r\n5. https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/emails-in-lawsuit-suggest-geo-group-forces-ice-detainees-to-work-11310005\r\n6. https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/09/584722399/appeals-court-broadens-immigrant-detainee-case-alleging-forced-labor\r\n7. https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-immigrant-workers-20170305-story.html\r\n8. https://www.wsj.com/articles/detention-operators-face-suits-over-1-a-day-work-programs-for-migrants-1532170801\r\n9. https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/lawsuit-accuses-private-prison-contractor-of-forced-labor-in-immigrant-detention/\r\n10. https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2020/03/02/11th-circuit-keeps-alive-claims-of-forced-labor-at-private-south-georgia-detention-center/\r\n11. https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2020/01/30/lawyers-trade-appellate-arguments-over-forced-labor-at-immigrant-detention-site/\r\n12. https://onlabor.org/the-use-of-forced-labor-in-private-immigration-detention-centers/\r\n13. https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2019/12/immigration-detainee-geo-forced-labor-lawsuit/\r\n14. https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/ice_detainees_may_proceed_as_a_class_in_forced_labor_lawsuit_appeals_court\r\n15. https://lawprofessors.typepad.com/immigration/2020/05/ending-forced-labor-in-ice-detention-centers-a-new-approach-georgetown-immigration-law-journal-for.html\r\n16. http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/laborimmigrationdetention.pdf\r\n17. http://inthesetimes.com/features/ice_immigrant_detention_centers_forced_prison_labor_investigation.html\r\n18. https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/immigrant-detention-contractors-can-be-liable-for-forced-labor\r\n19. https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/sd-me-detention-lawsuit-20180516-story.html\r\n20. https://www.usccr.gov/press/2018/01-02.pdf\r\n21. https://www.axios.com/private-prisons-immigrant-detention-8e5b3317-8ecf-476c-b915-25330852e66f.html\r\n22. https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/us/using-jailed-migrants-as-a-pool-of-cheap-labor.html\r\n22. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-detention/11-toothpaste-immigrants-pay-big-for-basics-at-private-ice-lock-ups-idUSKCN1PC0DJ\r\n23. https://www.thedailybeast.com/republicans-say-forced-labor-is-good-for-detained-immigrants-in-letter-defending-private-prison\r\n24. https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/13/us/senators-letter-dhs-ice-detention-work-program-invs/index.html\r\n25. https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/11/us/northwest-immigrant-detention-center-geo-group-invs/index.html\r\n\r\nIn addition to this representative sampling, the exceptional media interest in these claims has prompted the following action at the Congressional level: \r\n\r\n1. Letter from lawmakers to three Executive Branch agencies (in body of story: https://www.thedailybeast.com/republicans-say-forced-labor-is-good-for-detained-immigrants-in-letter-defending-private-prison)\r\n2. Letter from Sen.

Pressley and Sen. Warren https://pressley.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-pressley-senator-warren-colleagues-investigate-revolving-door-between\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Public Confidence prong of DHS's expedited processing regulations, in addition to the sources provided above, your office should consider the following information in making its expedited processing determination: \r\n1. https://www.thedailybeast.com/private-prison-executive-at-geo-group-pursues-federal-funds-spends-at-trump-hotel\r\n2. https://www.thedailybeast.com/private-prison-bosses-beg-taxpayers-to-pay-human-trafficking-lawsuit-bills\r\n3. https://www.thedailybeast.com/ex-ice-official-paid-to-defend-dollar1-a-day-wages-for-immigrants\r\n4. https://www.thedailybeast.com/did-private-prison-contractor-illegally-boost-trump\r\n5. https://www.newsweek.com/geo-group-private-prisons-immigration-detention-trump-596505\r\n\r\nIf, as it appears from DHS-OIG's actions over the past several years, no Contractor Notifications have been received by the Department, in direct contravention of the Federal Acquisition Regulations and these private detention contracts, which amount to billions of dollars of federal tax dollars committed over a period as long as 15 years to contractors who have manifestly failed to comply with their contracts and the certification provisions of the FAR and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations relating to contractors' obligations upon receiving credible allegations of forced labor, this fact would significantly undermine the public confidence in the agency's ability to oversee these federal funds and the contractors who profit from receiving them. \r\n\r\nI therefore respectfully request Expedited Processing of this request, including a determination within 10 working days as to whether DHS-OIG will grant it.\r\n\r\nIf you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Based on this information, I ask that you reconsider my client's expedited processing request and make a de novo determination on it within ten business days. I have also appealed today's determination administratively, which would become moot if you were to grant based on this request. See \r\n\r\nAn urgent need to inform the public exists because Congress is currently debating the FY21 Appropriations Bill, which will determine levels of future funding for contracts and contractors, as well as ICE and OIG, for civil immigration detention. \r\n\r\nA record from OIG confirming that the contractors, ICE, and OIG have violated the FAR and HSAR provisions cited is a material and directly relevant matter of consideration for House appropriators, because the ultimate penalty for violating these provisions can include voiding the contracts and permanently disbarring the contractors involved. \r\n\r\nCongress and the public have a right to know, in a time that allows for prompt and effective action, whether OIG, ICE's Contracting Officer, and these contractors have violated the terms of the contracts on which their appropriated funds are based. \r\n\r\nSeparately, the confirmation that contractors have failed to fulfill their contractual obligations with respect to the cited FAR and HSAR provisions has a direct and immediate impact on the individuals currently in ICE custody who are currently being subjected to these alleged practices by ICE's two largest detention contractors. \r\n\r\nIn sum, waiting until after Congress makes funding decisions to release this information now, when it matters, will render this information far less useful, and violate the letter and purpose of the FOIA. \r\n\r\nMany thanks, \r\n\r\nR.

        "communication": "Good evening, \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Lubbock Central Appraisal District received your public information request for \u201cA copy of records/correspondence/related to how the decision to increase property tax values in Lubbock County this year was reached.\u201d  The District has over 160,000 property accounts.  Each year the District must assign an appraised value to each of these accounts.  In addition, there are many different types of properties, and they are not necessarily appraised in the same manner.  Therefore, a request for records and correspondence related to the yearly appraisal is very broad.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you could clarify or narrow this request, it would assist the District in responding and reduce the time necessary to fulfill the request, as well as the charges that may be made under the Public Information Act.  For example, you could narrow or clarify this request by being more specific about the types of records you request.  Alternatively, you could narrow the request to a certain type of property, such as single-family homes or hotels.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFurther, some of the information you are requesting is confidential as a matter of law. Unless you remove confidential information from your request, we will need to request a decision of the Attorney General about the withholding of this information, further delaying a response. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease consider this a request to clarify or narrow your request.  Pursuant to Section 552.222(d) of the Texas Government Code, your request will be considered automatically withdrawn if we do not receive a written response from you within sixty-one (61) days from the date of this email.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMonica Buescher\r\n\r\nPublic Information Coordinator\r\n\r\nCommunication/Procedures Administrator \r\n\r\nLubbock Central Appraisal District\r\n\r\n <mailto:piarequest@lubbockcad.org> piarequest@lubbockcad.org\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSec. 552.222.  PERMISSIBLE INQUIRY BY GOVERNMENTAL BODY TO REQUESTOR.  (a)  The officer for public information and the officer's agent may not make an inquiry of a requestor except to establish proper identification or except as provided by Subsection (b), (c), or (c-1).\r\n\r\n(b)  If what information is requested is unclear to the governmental body, the governmental body may ask the requestor to clarify the request.  If a large amount of information has been requested, the governmental body may discuss with the requestor how the scope of a request might be narrowed, but the governmental body may not inquire into the purpose for which information will be used.\r\n\r\n(c)  If the information requested relates to a motor vehicle record, the officer for public information or the officer's agent may require the requestor to provide additional identifying information sufficient for the officer or the officer's agent to determine whether the requestor is eligible to receive the information under Chapter 730 <https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=730> , Transportation Code.  In this subsection, \"motor vehicle record\" has the meaning assigned that term by Section  <https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=730.003> 730.003, Transportation Code.\r\n\r\n(c-1)  If the information requested includes a photograph described by Section 552.155 <https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.155> (a), the officer for public information or the officer's agent may require the requestor to provide additional information sufficient for the officer or the officer's agent to determine whether the requestor is eligible to receive the information under Section 552.155 <https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.155> (b).\r\n\r\n(d)  If by the 61st day after the date a governmental body sends a written request for clarification or discussion under Subsection (b) or an officer for public information or agent sends a  written request for additional information under Subsection (c) the governmental body, officer for public information, or agent, as applicable, does not receive a written response from the requestor, the underlying request for public information is considered to have been withdrawn by the requestor.\r\n\r\n(e)  A written request for clarification or discussion under Subsection (b) or a written request for additional information under Subsection (c) must include a statement as to the consequences of the failure by the requestor to timely respond to the request for clarification, discussion, or additional information.\r\n\r\n(f)  Except as provided by Subsection (g), if the requestor's request for public information included the requestor's physical or mailing address, the request may not be considered to have been withdrawn under Subsection (d) unless the governmental body, officer for public information, or agent, as applicable, sends the request for clarification or discussion under Subsection (b) or the written request for additional information under Subsection (c) to that address by certified mail.\r\n\r\n(g)  If the requestor's request for public information was sent by electronic mail, the request may be considered to have been withdrawn under Subsection (d) if:\r\n\r\n     (1)  the governmental body, officer for public information, or agent, as applicable, sends the request for clarification or discussion under Subsection (b) or the written request for additional information under Subsection (c) by electronic mail to the same electronic mail address from which the original request was sent or to another electronic mail address provided by the requestor; and\r\n\r\n     (2)  the governmental body, officer for public information, or agent, as applicable, does not receive from the requestor a written response or response by electronic mail within the period described by Subsection (d).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdded by Acts 1993, 73rd Leg., ch. 268, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1993.  Amended by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 1035, Sec. 15, eff. Sept. 1, 1995;  Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 1187, Sec. 5, eff.
