(Mark) Hill, Jr., USN (Ret.) and RADM Merlin H. Staring, JAGC, USN (Ret) to the Secretary of the Army briefly relates the account of the attack on the USS Liberty and the US Navy Court of Inquiry into that attack.\r\n\r\nI have attached a copy of that letter.\r\n\r\nOn page three of the letter, we are told that the US Navy Court of Inquiry proceedings were tape-recorded.\r\n\r\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act we are asking you to release to us the tape recording referenced in the letter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoe Meadors",
