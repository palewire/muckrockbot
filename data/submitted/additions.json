This includes but is not limited to: any electronic record of a key swipe, key fob use, code input, etc. indicating her entering the building or the parking lot. This includes but is not limited to the dates and times she has entered or exited the building or parking lot. \r\n\r\nIf any part of this request is not able to be fulfilled due to technological considerations, the lack or records, statutes prohibiting releasing, or the common law balancing test, the rest should be fulfilled according to law (and explanations for non-fulfillment should be given). \r\n\r\nThis request is being submitted via Muckrock to maintain anonymity, which is allowed under the law. That said, all legal remedies will be pursued to obtain the records. Judge Berz is up for election and the public has an incredibly strong interest in knowing how often (or little) she is in the building.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
