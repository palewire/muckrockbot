Govt. Code section 7920.000, et seq., hereinafter the \u201cCPRA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) seeking the following records:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2026 records about the department's recruiting campaign, Unrivaled. VGCA (Very Good Creative Agency, LLC)\r\n\r\n1-All documents, data collected pre- and post-campaign launch, PowerPoint or equivalent slides, assets including videos created in draft or final form, design mockups, and final designs.\r\n\r\n2-All in digital or physical format.

It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department has conducted a search and responds to your request as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the Department has any records responsive to your request for items 1-7, these records remain privileged, confidential, and exempt from disclosure pursuant to the California Government Code Section 7922.000. Section 7922.000 permits the non-disclosure of such records and information when \u201cthe public interest served by not disclosing the record and/or information, clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure. The Department has a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the records that consist of confidential information, deliberative, pre-decisional discussion and drafts. The disclosure of such records would undermine the Department\u2019s ability to effectively achieve its objectives. Furthermore, Subsection 7.1 (E) of the City\u2019s contract with the Very Good Creative Agency (VGCA), LLC, clearly states that \u201c\u2026Any reports, findings, deliverables, analyses, studies, notes, information, or data generated as a result of this Agreement are to be considered confidential\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for item 8 on your request, to the extent that there are any records responsive to your request, for contracts and agreements, these records are available, published and can be accessed at the following links:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://ethics.lacity.gov/data/contracts/contracts/#dt\r\n\r\nhttps://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinecontracts/2024/C-145963_c_08-07-24.pdf\r\n\r\nhttps://www.lapdpolicecom.lacity.org/070924/BPC_24-145.pdf\r\n\r\nhttps://www.lapdpolicecom.lacity.org/032624/BPC_24-052.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to the invoices related to your request, these records are available on the Office of the City Controller\u2019s website, and can be accessed at the following link:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://lacity.spending.socrata.com/#!/year/2025/explore/0-/vendor_name/VERY+GOOD+CREATIVE+AGENCY+LLC/0-/government_activity/PROTECTION+OF+PERSONS+AND+PROPERTY/1/account_name\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.nextrequest.civicplus.help/hc/en-us/categories/17720084172567-Requesters\">help page</a>",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing James \"Jimmy\" Roosevelt II (December 23,\r\n    1907 \u2013 August 13, 1991), including the pages identified as potentially\r\n    responsive in FOIA 1348034-000.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously\r\n    written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over\r\n    100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the\r\n    People,\r\n    Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable\r\n    expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well\r\n    established. In\r\n    addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available\r\n    through\r\n    non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock,\r\n    disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to\r\n    this, a great\r\n    deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the\r\n    government itself.\r\n    As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this\r\n    particular\r\n    subject in advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information\r\n    to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch,\r\n    Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\r\n    Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified\r\n    because it also\r\n    had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning\r\n    United States\r\n    foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I\r\n    qualify as a member of\r\n    the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the\r\n    requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade\r\n    by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper\r\n    reporter, for\r\n    example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much\r\n    interest there is\r\n    in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the\r\n    details of the\r\n    request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee\r\n    category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and\r\n    making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Non-Individual FOIA Request\r\n\r\nRequest Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    The 5,996 pages considered potentially responsive to FOIA 1346536-000.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).

Privileged or confidential records provided or received in error should not be reviewed, used, disseminated, distributed, or copied, and should be destroyed immediately.

Redactions have been applied throughout the documents pursuant to the following exemption:   \r\n Ex. 01A Attorney-Client            Privileged Communications - RCW 42.56.070 and 5.60.060 Records reflect            communication between a client and an attorney for the purpose of seeking or            providing legal advice. \r\nThe\u202fLegislative Department has now provided all responsive records. We consider your request closed and plan to take no further action to fulfill this request. If you have any follow-up questions or would like to initiate an administrative appeal under MDAR 17-0002 Section 6, please contact us within 10 business days after downloading your records, after which this request will no longer be monitored for communications. You may also seek judicial review of our response to your request for a period of one year, beginning as of the date of this message, consistent with RCW 42.56.550. \r\nSincerely, \r\nMatt Jaeger \r\n(206) 684-8159 \r\nLegislative Department",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of the U.S. Marines Corps personnel records (OMPF) for a former servicemember named ADAM DOUGLAS DRIVER (DATE OF BIRTH: 11/19/1983). Mr. Driver was born in Fontana, California. He served in the U.S. Marines Corps from 2001 to 2004 and achieved the rank of lance corporal. The requested records include performance reports, job assessments, disciplinary records, training received, discharge papers, and any other releasable records.\r\n\r\nI originally submitted this request to the National Personnel Records Center, which ordinarily handles these requests, but they claimed that they could locate no records for Mr. Driver. They forwarded the request to the Marines, who administratively closed my request after I did not respond to a denial letter (that I never personally received until after the closure) of my waiver of fees request. This is why I am sending the request directly to this office.\r\n\r\nThe public interest in Mr. Driver, an Academy Award-nominated film actor , should favor disclosure of many of these records, particularly in relation to any disciplinary records, should those records exist.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to review and release any segregable information, even if certain documents or portions of documents are withheld.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not a next of kin of this servicemember, and thus do not know Mr. Driver\u2019s Social Security Number. Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s relevant provisions. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

This talk is available for our field management to use whenever needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the second and third item in your request, a search was conducted that reveals that there are no records available responsive to your inquiry.

Doe 1-26 vs. Musk (https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.576293/gov.uscourts.mdd.576293.77.2.pdf), Jeremy Lewin stated that he has been employed at USAID since 1/28/2025 as a Senior Advisor. He also declares he has never worked for Elon Musk or the USDS. Jeremy Lewin was also among the initial team of DOGE staffers that arrived at the CFPB on or around 2/6/2025. He was also identified as being on the staff list at the National Institute of Health along with other identified DOGE staffer in an article published in Wired on 2/24/2025. I would like to request the following information where possible:\r\n\r\nFor USAID:\r\n1. Any confirmation that Jeremy Lewin was formally hired at USAID on or before 1/28/2025\r\n2. If Jeremy Lewin was detailed to the USAID from another agency, any relevant details on that arrangement that you can share, including a memorandum of understanding (or similar document) outlining his duties and responsibilities of each partner, as well as emails between the USAID and the other agency about the arrangement. I would expect this to be on our around Feb 6, 2025\r\n\r\nFor the CFPB and possibly USAID:\r\n3. If Jeremy Lewin was hired by the CFPB, any details you can share on that appointment, including if he signed the relevant onboarding paperwork as a new hire at the agency. I would expect this to be on or around February 6, 2025\r\n4. If Jeremy Lewin was detailed to the CFPB from another agency, any relevant details that can be shared on the memorandum of understanding (or similar documents) outlining his role and the responsibilities of each partner in this arrangement, as well as emails about the detailing arrangements where available in either USAID/State or the CFPB. I would expect these communication to be on or around February 6, 2025\r\n\r\nFor NIH and possibly USAID/CFPB:\r\n5. If Jeremy Lewin was detailed to the National Institute of Health from the USAID or CFPB, I would like to request the corresponding memorandum of understanding or other relevant documents about that arrangement, as well as any relevant email communications you can provide from any other agency to the National Institutes of Health about that arrangement. I do not have a precise date for this, but I would expect it to be in February 2025 before 2/24/2025\r\n\r\nFor US Doge Service:\r\n1. If you have any records that show that Jeremy Lewin was hired as an employee of USDS at any time in January or February 2025, I would appreciate that.\r\n2. Any communications between the USDS and other agencies (USAID/Department of State) coordinating the detailing of Jeremy Lewin to agencies like the CFPB alongside other staff employed by USDS\r\n\r\nI understand that you might not be able to provide me some agency-internal personnel records under FOIA exemptions 2 and 6, but I think it is in the public interest to understand the coordination among these agencies, and I would hope you would be able to provide me whatever relevant details can help provide more insight on what was being done in these partnerships. Please reach out if you need any clarification or want to give me feedback on my requests. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Harris",

FOIA Specialist our request has been assigned to Pamela Arrington, FOIA Specialist.\u00a0 You may contact Pamela Arrington\u00a0by email at parringtoncampbell@usaid.gov or by phone on 202-921-5010. \u00a0Please reference the tracking number cited above in any future correspondence. Extending the FOIA\u2019s Time Limits due to Unusual Circumstances The FOIA provides that an agency \u00a0may extend its time limits when \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d occur\u00a0in the processing of a request. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i) (2016).  Those \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d are set forth in the statute, 5 U.S.C \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii), and are described as: 1) The need to search for records from field facilities or other locations separate from the office processing the request; 2) The need to search, collect and examine voluminous records; and 3) The need for consultation with another agency. Based upon the records you have requested, we have determined that one or more unusual circumstances will occur during the processing of your request.  Accordingly, your response time-limit has been extended beyond the 20 days required by statute; therefore, 10 additional processing days have been added to your request. To mitigate this action, you may limit the scope of the request so that it can be processed more quickly or to arrange an alternative time to respond. \nlease note, as reported by various public sources and acknowledged across federal service channels, USAID is undergoing a broad realignment of programs and responsibilities. These shifts, coupled with reduced staffing levels and increasing litigation demands, have significantly impacted our FOIA processing capacity. If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact the assigned FOIA Specialist noted above. You may also contact USAID\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, Christopher Colbow, at foia@usaid.gov (mailto:foia@usaid.gov) . \n\nAdditionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services offered: Office of Government Information Services National Archives and Records Administration 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001 E-mail: ogis@nara.gov Telephone: 202-741-5770; Toll Free: 1-877-684-6448 Fax: 202-741-5769 Thank you for your interest in USAID.

L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. \r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:  \r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)  \r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement  \r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and  \r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n3.

Also note that improperly addressed (i.e., with the requester's name rather than \"MuckRock News\" and the department number) requests might be returned as undeliverable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 21, 2025:\r\nSubject: Massachusetts Public Records Law Request: Data on school-based arrests (Seekonk Police Department)\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department.\r\n\r\nUnder the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\n\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\n\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\n\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\n\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\n\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\n\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.

However, if any such communications are attached to or embedded within formal documentation\u2014such as policies, training materials, legal reviews, or procedural guidance\u2014they should be included in the responsive records for this request. \r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request yields no responsive records, I respectfully request that you state that explicitly.

Some have grades 1-7, and the salary structure starts at 8. Also, some have different letters and numbers that are not indicated in the CBA. (Pages 1-11 have no classifications or grades.).
