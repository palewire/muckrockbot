The Congressionally mandated ICE Detainee Death Report for Charles Leo Daniel, who died on March 7, 2024, at the GEO-owned Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington. \r\n2. All emails exchanged between ICE and GEO, ICE and CRCL, and ICE and Congress regarding the publication of the Congressionally Mandated Detainee Death Report sent or received between March 7, 2024, and April 17, 2024. \r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), I hereby request expedited processing and certify that the following is true and correct pursuant to 28 USC 1746: \r\n\r\n1. I am a member of the media primarily engaged in information collection and dissemination. \r\n2. Charles Leo Daniel died in ICE custody on December 7, 2024.https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/trinidad-and-tobago-national-ice-custody-dies-nwipc\r\n3. Implementing Congressional Appropriations requirements, ICE\u2019s death policy, ICE Directive 11003.5, Section 5.3, paragraph 4, mandates ICE make available to the public a detainee death report on its website within 30 days of a person\u2019s death. See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention/directive11003-5.pdf. \r\n4. ICE has previously failed to comply with this requirement -- most recently in the case of Frankline Okpu, who died December 6, 2023, and before that, in the case of Salvador Vargas.\r\n5. The ICE Detainee Death Report for Mr. Daniel is not online as of the date of this request. \r\n6. Public records obtained by advocates in Washington State reveal Mr. Daniel spent nearly four years in solitary confinement at NWIPC, despite having a final order of removal prior to entering the facility. https://jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/2024/03/15/nwdc-conditions-research-update-daniel-death-in-context/ \r\n7. Despite Congressional staff's presence at the facility on the day Mr. Daniel died, staffers found out via a news alert about his death. https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/man-who-died-at-wa-detention-site-was-in-solitary-for-years-researchers-say/ \r\n8. Mr. Daniel's Solitary Confinement violated US and international law, which prohibit torture and cruel inhuman, and degrading treatment of detained people, including those with mental illness, via solitary confinement. https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/137-Harv.-L.-Rev.-F.-175.pdf\r\n9. At least 6 people have attempted suicide since Mr. Daniel's death, reflecting an acute mental health crisis within NWIPC. https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/at-least-6-suicide-attempts-at-tacoma-ice-facility-911-calls-show/\r\n10. Hundreds of noncitizens currently reside inside involuntarily at GEO's Tacoma facility.\r\n11. Neither ICE nor any of its oversight bodies has publicly released information revealing the cause and manner of Mr. Daniel's death. \r\n\r\nBased on the above, there is an urgent need to inform the public regarding the facts surrounding Mr. Daniel's death, and the steps the agency may have taken to prevent harm to other people locked inside the Tacoma facility at government expense.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

You requested the following information:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   Internal memoranda, directives, and communications delineating the planning, execution, and objectives of such covert operations, inclusive of any allusions to MK Ultra or analogous programs.\r\n  *   Operational blueprints, strategies, and protocols dictating the conduct of surveillance and intelligence-gathering activities, encompassing any involvement or coordination with community policing endeavors.\r\n  *   Records chronicling surveillance operations, encompassing logs, reports, and warrants procured for monitoring targeted individuals or groups, alongside any watch lists or databases utilized for tracking.\r\n  *   Intelligence reports, evaluations, and analyses engendered as a consequence of surveillance and infiltration efforts, encompassing any evaluations concerning private contractors engaged in intelligence operations.\r\n  *   Educational resources, manuals, and protocols utilized to instruct personnel involved in covert operations, encompassing any materials pertaining to community alerts or coordination with neighborhood watch groups.\r\n  *   Budgetary documents germane to the financing and allocation of resources for covert surveillance and intelligence activities.\r\n  *   Legal opinions, guidelines, and interpretations pertinent to the legality and oversight of covert programs.\r\n  *   Post-operation analyses, appraisals, and evaluations undertaken to scrutinize the efficacy and ramifications of covert operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe COPS Office does not maintain records such as those that you described.  The COPS Office is the grant-making component of the U.S. Department of Justice responsible for advancing the practice of community policing by the nation's state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies through information and grant resources.  This Office maintains records pertaining to the application for, and award and monitoring of COPS grant funding.  The office also maintains records on its own administrative operations and procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FOIA operation for both the Department of Justice and the federal government is decentralized and each Department component and federal entity maintains and handles FOIA requests for its own records. Accordingly, you need to direct your letter to the office(s) you believe have records pertaining to the subject of your request. Additional information regarding the federal government\u2019s administration of the FOIA, including a listing of FOIA contact information, is available at www.foia.gov<http://www.foia.gov>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may contact the COPS Office FOIA Public Liaison at 202-514-1873 to discuss any aspect of your request. Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov<mailto:ogis@nara.gov>; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with my determination in response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website: https://www.justice.gov/oip/submit-and-track-request-or-appeal.  Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request. If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like further information on the COPS Office, please visit our Internet site at https://www.cops.usdoj.gov.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNicole Lee\r\n\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\n",

The most recent public records should be produced first and the oldest records produced last by date.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION PROCESSING AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip compression in each installment.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",
