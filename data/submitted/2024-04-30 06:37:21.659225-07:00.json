        "communication": "April 29, 2024\r\n\r\nSUBJECT: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nFEDERAL WAY School District \u2013 Request for a complete electronic copies of (5) MICROSOFT .pst format data archives for the time period 1-1-2020 to 04-29-2024.\r\n\r\nVia email to: publicrecordsrequest@fwps.org\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I Request for a complete electronic copy of the entire MICROSOFT .pst format data archive for each of the following specific email address(es)/email box(s) for the time period January 1, 2020 to April 29, 2024:\r\n\r\nasherida@fwps.org\r\nhfisher@fwps.org\r\npublicrecordsrequest@fwps.org\r\nsuperintendent@fwps.org\r\nrbutz@fwps.org\r\n\r\nPlease ensure each DATA ARCHIVE is produced electronically as a single separate .pst file format data file. This request is for the identified public records to be exported from the FEDERAL WAY SCHOOL DISTRICT email data servers, in accordance with the public database export provisions incorporated within the public records act RCW 42.56. This public records request is *NOT* for individual email files or records.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR \"Reasonably translatable\" electronic records - WAC 44-14-05002(2)(b)\r\n\r\nThis data export request is for the simple database export of five (5) \u201c@fwps.org\u201d datasets from the commercially available format your agency employs to the freely available commercial format Microsoft .pst. This request is for \"Reasonably translatable\" electronic records - WAC 44-14-05002(2)(b). Your agency stores these electronic records in a generally commercially available format. This request is for a database EXPORT FUNCTION of the (5) datasets identified in this request to the NATIVE .pst file format. No translation into another format is necessary as the .pst file format is the generally commercially available format of the record I am requesting. WAC 44-14-05002(2)(c)(ii).\r\n\r\nFurther, if your agency has a need to redact these records and claim various exemptions, any redaction process in no way obstructs your agency from providing the final .pst file as requested, with redactions, coupled with contemporaneous exemption logs as required by RCW RCW 42.56.210.\r\n\r\nThis request does not require specialized programming, the .pst file format is in regular use by your agency for regular day-today business operations. The process of export to .pst for this data requires less than a half dozen mouse clicks. As such, no customized service charge is applicable. If your agency claims the need for a customized service charge, provide a detailed explanation of the service charge, including why it applies, a description of the specific expertise required, and a reasonable estimate of the cost of the charge (WAC 44-14-05004.)\r\n\r\nFEES FOR REDACTION ARE NOT APPLICABLE\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56. 120 (2)(e). An agency cannot charge a \"redaction fee\" for the staff time necessary to prepare the records for inspection, for the copying required to redact records before they are inspected, or an archive fee for getting the records from off-site.\r\n\r\nDATE RANGE\r\nThe date range for this request is January 1, 2020 to April 29, 2024.\r\n\r\nUSE OF PORTAL NOT MANDATORY\r\n\r\nWashington State Law is clear that the use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA) for a public records request is optional for the requestor. Respectfully I decline. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment to this email address.\r\n\r\nPlease do not register this requestor for, nor direct this requestor to the use of any 3rd party commercial portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other online service other than a direct NO PASSWORD REQUIRED, NO REGISTRATION REQUIRED, internet cloud-based download link, or electronic email.\r\n\r\nDo not send any portion of this public records request to any 3rd party for-profit corporation such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nDo not register this request with any for profit portal or 3rd party organization such as GOVQA, a Grannicus Corporation, or NEXT-REQUEST.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, in this request the MICROSOFT .pst file format. Please provide all electronic records in the fewest number of individual files as per native format or use free .zip or digital compression in each installment for the fewest number of total records and the most economical calculation of any applicable public records fees.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITAGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nRecords relating to, mentioning, or generated as a result of investigation or inquiry for Donald David DeFreeze, aka Cinque Mtume, aka General Field Marshal Cinque (November 16, 1943 \u2013 May 17, 1974).\r\n\r\nThis information has already been released previously. Page 11 of the FBI's 2003 FOIA log, attached, indicates journalist Tom O'Neill filed FOIPA request 961930-001 the year prior. The bureau reopened the request on May 15, 2003, and closed it again on May 3, 2005. The log discloses that 1,812 pages were released as part of that request, thus I am requesting all information previously released in that request and any additional information released since then.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of a violation of Mr. DeFreeze's privacy, as he passed away in 1974. I have attached a reproduction of an obituary, published in The New York Times on May 24, 1974.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
