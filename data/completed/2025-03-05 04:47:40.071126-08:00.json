I'm emailing to inquire about the search and scope of the request - for example, the Office of Public Affairs is much more likely to maintain records.  As such, would you be amenable to a search being conducted solely in the Office of Public Affairs or both the Office of Public Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General?  Also, narrowing the scope to a specific time frame and topic would be beneficial, and would significantly cut down on processing time.  Please let me know if you're also amenable to narrowing to a specific time frame and topic.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nKim Kochurka\r\nGovernment Information Specialist\r\nOffice of Information Policy\r\nU.S. Department of Justice\r\nPh: (202) 616-9712\r\nKimberley.Kochurka@usdoj.gov <mailto:Kimberley.Kochurka@usdoj.gov>\n",

Please be advised that OIP\u2019s FOIA Library post under the heading \u201cRecords of Communications Between the Office of Public Affairs and The News Media Organizations\u201d now has records dating to January 7, 2019. I am inquiring into your interest in narrowing the timeframe of your search to January 7, 2019 through March 2, 2019. I updated our search to that date range which located just over 1500 emails that are potentially responsive to your request. Additionally, I\u2019d like to suggest narrowing your request to emails with FOXNews employees as the current emails include list-serve type email blasts that were received by Public Affairs employees from the @foxnews.com domain. If you are still interested in this request and my suggested narrower scope, please respond to this email. If I have not heard from you after thirty business days, I will assume you are no longer interested in this matter and will close your request administratively.\r\n\nThank you for your time,\r\n\r\nEric Hotchkiss\r\nSenior Government Information Specialist\r\nDepartment of Justice\r\nOffice of Information Policy\r\nOffice: 202-616-5456",

He also served as the Secretary of the Navy and as a United States Senator. He was born on on Oct. 22, 1922 and died on Oct. 24, 1999. (Obituary: https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-oct-26-mn-26438-story.html)\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please search HQ records as well as ALL field offices and resident agencies.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities, and am currently a reporter of The Boston Globe.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v.

If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Friday, November 5, 2021. In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the 11-year timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take several years to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before January 7, 2022, providing monthly installments thereafter. The district is currently processing multiple requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests. At this time of the year especially, with the upcoming holidays and the closure of district facilities for the Thanksgiving and winter breaks, staff resources are even more limited.\r\n\r\nAs students are the nature of our business, many public records frequently include information about students. If any of the responsive documents contain student names or other identifying information (parent names, student ID numbers etc.), it is the typical practice of the district to redact those names when the requestor agrees to that practice. Please let us know if you have an objection to such redaction and the basis of your objection.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image002.png@01D7D649.21D9FD90]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. These redactions primarily include student names or other student/parent identifying information, or the redaction of staff personal information such as a personal email address or cell phone number.

We are providing an additional opportunity for you to respond to our notifications that an installment of records has been made available to you.\r\n\r\nIf you fail to respond to this notification by March 14, 2022, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, as we have not heard from you since your original request was made and we have not received confirmation of your receipt of the January 7, 2022 installment, we have halted further work on this request until we receive confirmation of receipt of both installments provided to date. Upon such confirmation, the anticipated date for the next installment of records will be provided.

In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and you requested production of electronic records in their native electronic format for each record. Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be located in the email string below.\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have a third installment of records available for you. As requested, the records are being provided in reverse chronological order and represent an additional two of the public records requests received in 2021, and ten of the public records requests received in 2020, as well as the district responses to those requests. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. These redactions primarily include student names or other student/parent identifying information, or the redaction of staff personal information such as a personal email address or cell phone number.\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments or a non-password protected public link; however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email, and one request contains an OML video file that requires a special software to play, which we are also providing to you in order to view it. For security purposes, we are unable to upload those files to create a shareable link. Therefore, this installment of records has been placed onto a USB drive and is being mailed to you today via USPS Priority Mail. As noted in your request, the USB is addressed to:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144-2516\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 9405 5036 9930 0196 9827 76<https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction?qtc_tLabels1=9405%205036%209930%200196%209827%2076> and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, we anticipate the next installment of records responsive to your request will be available on or before April 22, 2022.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Mack\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\nSuperintendent's Office\r\nSMack@everettsd.org<mailto:SMack@everettsd.org>\r\n425-385-4123\r\n[cid:image001.png@01D83ACB.05C41BE0]<http://www.everettsd.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1>\n",

This installment represents one of the public records requests received in 2021, and the district\u2019s response to that request. While this installment contains only one request, it was a large request that took many months to fulfill. Please note that this request was made by a parent of a student in the District, and our initial response provided notification that our typical process is to redact all student names and other identifying information, including parent names. No objection to such redactions was made in response to that notification; therefore, the initial requester\u2019s last name and other identifying information has been redacted to protect the identity of the student, whose name, and other identifying details have also been redacted. The detailed redaction/exemption logs, as they were provided to the original requester, are included.

These records represent 1 public records request received in 2021 and 5 public records requests received in 2020, and the district responses to those requests. Please note that two of these requests were made by parents of students in the district, and our initial response provided notification that our typical process is to redact all student names and other identifying information, including parent names. No objection to such redactions was made in response to that notification; therefore, the initial requester\u2019s name and other identifying information have been redacted and replaced with initials to protect the identity of the student, whose name, and other identifying details have also been redacted. In addition, a detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. New redactions are marked with a redaction code directly on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided with the installment. In addition, one record was withheld in its entirety as the record is a student education record and is protected from public disclosure (request 20200930 1b LB). The original requester was the parent of the student whose education record was requested, and the requester later abandoned her request, so there are no records to provide for that request. An Exemption Log for the record withheld is also provided in this installment.\r\n\r\nThese records are being provided electronically via a shared file which you can access using the link below.

These records installments were received on the following dates:\r\n\r\n01/07/2022\r\n02/11/2022\r\n03/21/2022\r\n04/22/2022\r\n05/27/2022\r\n07/28/2022\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the PRA.

In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. You also stated that any \u201crecords previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d Lastly, you requested that records be provided by email attachments or electronic link and provided instructions for mailing any records being produced on a USB drive or CD. Thank you for confirming that your request is not for commercial purposes. A copy of your complete request can be found in the email string below.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than one year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before November 21, 2023, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be December 31, 2024. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on Monday, October 9, 2023. In that request you noted that this was a follow up to a previous request and you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through October 6, 2023.\u201d Additionally, you requested that if installments are provided, that they should be produced in reverse chronological order, from most recent to the earliest, and requested electronic production of records in their native electronic format for each record. You also stated that any \u201crecords previously produced do not have to be produced again.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the following reasons, your request is deemed abandoned as of February 16, 2024, and is now closed.\r\n\r\nIt is our standard practice to follow the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code (WAC), as these model rules serve to guide public agencies regarding public records requests. Under the model rules established in WAC 44-14-04005(1), it is the \u201cObligation of requestor to claim or review records. After the agency notifies the requestor that the records or an installment of them is ready for inspection or copying, the requestor must claim or review the records or the installment. RCW 42.56.120.\u201d Additionally, \u201cIf a requestor fails to claim or review the records or any installment of them within the thirty-day notification period, the agency may close the request and refile the records.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn our initial response on October 16, 2024, the district notified you that, \u201cAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 2023, an initial installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were notified that you must 1) click the link; and 2) download or click on the files; and 3) notify us to indicate receipt of the records or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available. On December 6, 2023, you responded to our notification with the word \u201cDONE\u201d next to both item number one and item number two, and with the word \u201cNOTIFIED\u201d next to item three. Accordingly, on December 6, 2023, the district acknowledged that you claimed the installment made available to you on November 17, 2023, and provided the next installment date to produce records as January 5, 2024.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2024, a second installment of records was provided to you via a public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installment. On January 8, 2024, you notified the district that you were unable to access the installment as the link had expired. The same day, we responded and apologized for the inconvenience and reset the expiration date on the link to the records. You were notified that, \u201cIf you fail to respond to this notification by February 8, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d To date we have not received a response from you to claim these records or to indicate that you were unable to access these records. However, as you had attempted to claim the records from the initial link provided for this installment, the district moved forward with your request, despite not receiving confirmation that you were able to claim the records using the updated link.\r\n\r\nOn February 16, 2024, a third installment of records was provided via public link to a shared folder. You were provided the same notifications and instructions as the prior installments. You were notified that the system would not notify us when you accessed your records, and you were asked to reply to our email to confirm receipt of the responsive records. You were notified that, \u201cas part of our typical practice, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of this notification that an installment of records is ready for you, we will consider your request to be abandoned and close it at that time without further action.\u201d You were also notified that to \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201creview\u201d records that are shared via an electronic link, such as the ones provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, within 30 days you must click the link provided; and download or click on the files; and notify us to indicate receipt of the records made available to you or to let us know if you are unable to access the records made available to you. We also stated that, \u201cif you fail to respond to this notification by March 17, 2024, your request will be deemed abandoned, the link to the files will no longer be available, and we will close your request at that time without any further action.\u201d We also notified you that, \u201cwe have halted further work on this request until we receive confirmation that you have claimed receipt of both of the January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, installments.\u201d To date, no response to claim these records has been received.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, because the district has received no response from you acknowledging receipt of the installments of records provided on January 8, 2024, and February 16, 2024, and because you have not contacted us in any other manner to indicate you were unable to access the records provided, your request has been deemed abandoned as of February 16, 2024, and is now closed.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]<https://www.everettsd.org/>\r\nWendy L.

Installments previously provided to you include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     *   01/07/2022\r\n     *   02/11/2022\r\n     *   03/21/2022\r\n     *   04/22/2022\r\n     *   05/27/2022\r\n     *   07/28/2022\r\n     *   11/17/2023\r\n     *   1/8/2024\r\n     *   2/16/2024\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease kindly respond to our request for clarification no later than Friday, March 29, 2024, so that we can move forward with processing your request. If we do not hear from you by that date, we will proceed with our understanding of the request as outlined above.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than a year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before May 10, 2024, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be May 2, 2025. The district is currently processing numerous requests for records, and, like yours, the size and scope of these requests vary in nature, and some of these requests are quite extensive and take a great deal of time to process. While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nAs part of our typical practice, and in accordance with the model rules established by the Washington State Attorney General\u2019s Office and Chapter 44-14 of the Washington Administrative Code, if you do not review or claim your records within 30 days of a notification that an installment of records is ready for you, by indicating receipt of the records made available to you, or by indicating that you are unable to access the records made available to you, we will consider your request to be abandoned after 30 calendar days and close it at that time without further action.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records. For reference, all the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://everettsd.org/publicrecords.org.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A close up of a sign  Description automatically generated]<https://www.everettsd.org/>\r\nWendy L.

Based on the language used in that email it is unclear if this was intended to be a clarification of the March 19, 2024, request or if it was intended to be a new request for records.\r\n\r\nAt this time, we consider this to be a new request for records, as the date range extends beyond the date of the previous March 19, 2024, request, and the link you have included for us to upload records is different than the link provided for the March 19, 2024, request. If you intended for your email clarify your March 19, 2024, request, or if you intended for this new request to replace the March 19, 2024, request, please let us know. Otherwise, we will move forward with both requests respectively.\r\n\r\nIn this request, you have asked for, \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through March 22, 2024.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn accordance with RCW 42.56.520<https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.520>, I am acknowledging receipt of your request and providing notice that the district will require additional time to respond. This time is needed to seek any clarifications to the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to potentially notify any affected third parties, and to review the records for any exempt information.\r\n\r\nAt this time, given the timeframe of this request, and until the full scope of the request is ascertained, we estimate that it will take more than a year to respond in full to this request. We anticipate providing an initial installment of records on or before May 17, 2024, providing regular installments every four to six weeks thereafter until the request is fulfilled, currently estimated to be May 30, 2025.

While we do our best to respond to requests as quickly as possible, we have limited staff and resources available to process these requests.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier for you to claim future installments of records and prevent further abandonments of your requests moving forward, whenever possible we will upload installments of records to you using the link you have provided for this request.\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Feverett-public-schools-district-29079%252Feverett-public-schools-district-request-for-a-complete-electronic-copy-of-all-public-records-requests-received-by-the-district-including-district-responses-for-the-years-2010-2021-120970%252F%253Femail%253DPublicRecords%252540everettsd.org&url_auth_token=AAEh7OGhIjD3G3hthbXF_zOl4rI%3A1rne10%3AM10-zV4YF_dmLfUXiw4O8SOKj6lRHZzP8a9MqfnKtIo\r\n\r\nIf an alternate method to provide records is necessary, we will notify you that the records will be provided in another method, likely to be placed on a USB and mailed to the address provided:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you for a satisfactory resolution to your request for public records.

In that request you asked for \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am writing to let you know that we have concluded processing this request and have the responsive records available for you. These records include 127 public records requests and the district\u2019s responses to those requests that are still in existence for the period requested. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Redactions are marked with a redaction code on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is also provided in accordance with RCW 42.56.210(3).\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that your preference is to receive the records as email attachments or a non-password protected public link; however, the size of this installment is too large to be sent via email, and at least one request contains a file (OcularisViewer.exe) required to view an OML video file. For security purposes, we are unable to upload this file to create a shareable link. Therefore, the responsive records have been placed onto a USB drive which is being sent via USPS Priority Mail. As noted in your request, the records are addressed to:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 4200211545779405830109355084411851 and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records.\r\n\r\nI believe the records provided are fully responsive to your request as I have interpreted it, and, upon confirmation of the delivery of the records to you, your request will be considered fully satisfied and thereafter closed. If you have any questions or feel I have misinterpreted your request in any way, please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can work together to resolve any issues.\r\n\r\nFor reference, all of the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page: https://www.everettsd.org/publicrecords.\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.png@01DA86BB.0CDDA6B0]\r\n\r\nWendy L.

We appreciate your communication with us.\r\n\r\nOur records indicate that delivery of the USB containing the responsive records for your request was delivered and received by MuckRock at 12:17 pm on April 8, 2024. Attached is a copy of the delivery confirmation email received by USPS.\r\n\r\nIn our April 4, 2024, communication we stated that we would accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records, and that upon that confirmation your request would be considered fully satisfied and thereafter closed. Accordingly, as your request stated that providing records on USB by mail to MuckRock was an acceptable method for delivery, and because all responsive records have been provided and confirmation of delivery of the records was received, your request was considered fulfilled and was closed on April 8, 2024. As the district does not have anything further to provide for this closed request, no further action is planned and the one-year statute of limitations to seek judicial review began on April 8, 2024.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to locate the records previously provided, or if you have any questions or feel I have misinterpreted your request in any way, please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can work together to resolve any issues.\r\n\r\nFor reference, all of the district\u2019s policies and procedures for public records are available on our website at this page:  https://www.everettsd.org/publicrecords.\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DA97E3.3798C4A0]\r\n\r\nWendy L.

        "communication": "Dear PRA Audit,\r\n\r\nI am the public records officer for Everett Public Schools and am writing in response to your request for records received on March 22, 2024. In that request, you asked for, \u201ca complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Everett Public Schools District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through March 22, 2024.\u201d\r\n\r\nToday I am writing to let you know that we have an eighth installment of records available for you. These records include 24 public records requests received by the district between September 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, and the district\u2019s responses to those requests. Please note that we acknowledge your request to receive records in reverse chronological order, however, there is one public records request during this timeframe (December 13, 2022) that will be provided in the next installment of records, as it is a large request requiring extensive redaction of student and parent personal information and it is still being processed. A detailed redaction/exemption log, as it was provided to the original requester, is included with each request where applicable. Redactions are marked with a redaction code on the responsive records, and the explanation for those redactions can be found using the Redaction Code Log, which is provided in accordance with RCW 42.56.210(3).\r\n\r\nThe responsive records have been placed onto a USB drive which is being sent via USPS Priority Mail to the address provided in your request:\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120970\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nThe tracking number is: 4200211545779405530109355107600834<https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction!input.action?tLabels=4200211545779405530109355107600834> and the shipping label is attached for your reference.\r\n\r\nWhile we would appreciate an email from you confirming receipt of the records, we will accept the USPS package delivery notification as confirmation that you have received your records. Anticipated delivery date is Saturday, March 1, 2025.\r\n\r\nThe district has confirmed delivery of the previous installment provided, which the district accepts as your receipt of the installment provided, which was delivered in or at the mailbox at 3:44 pm on Monday, January 27, 2025. A copy of the delivery confirmation for that installment is attached for reference. If you did not receive the records provided, please let us know.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remainder of your request, we anticipate providing the next installment of records on or before April 9, 2025.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DB886E.29686850]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWendy L.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

        "communication": "Dear \"PRA Audit\" Requester,\r\n\r\nPursuant to RCW 42.56.520, this letter is to acknowledge receipt of the public records request you submitted to the Central Kitsap School District (\"District\") on November 7, 2021, via the District's electronic public records request form. Specifically, you requested the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Central Kitsap School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\nYou also requested that these records be provided to you in native electronic format. The District interprets that to mean that you would like the native format of the records as they were provided to each requester. Please let us know as soon as possible if this is not a correct interpretation of your request for records in native format. Please also be aware that in some instances it may not be possible to provide records in native format if additional redactions must be made to the records before they are provided to you.\r\n\r\nFurther, the records retention period for public records requests is two years, so the District does not have copies of all requests and responses dating back to January 1, 2010. However, the District will be sure to provide you with all responsive records currently in our possession.\r\n\r\nBecause of the broad nature of your request, please understand that it will take the District a significant amount of time to fill the request. If you would like to narrow the scope of your request so that we may provide you with the records you are seeking in a more expeditious manner, you are always welcome to do so.\r\n\r\nThe District currently estimates it will be able to provide you with all records responsive to this request by March 31, 2022, with an estimated date of December 17, 2021, for an initial installment of records. This estimated date will allow sufficient time for the District to conduct a search for all responsive records, review the records for information that is exempt for disclosure under the Public Records Act, apply any necessary redactions, and produce an exemption log to explain any redactions made to the records.\r\n\r\nAlthough these records were previously provided to requesters in response to public records requests, they will all have to be reviewed for student information that is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and other applicable exemptions related to both students and employees, as many of the records requests responsive to your request were made by families of students or District employees themselves.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that the above estimated date of completion is an estimate, and may be subject to change depending on a variety of factors, including the volume of records that are responsive to this request. If we require additional time to provide you with records responsive to your request, we will be sure to notify you in writing.\r\n\r\nThe District will contact you with an initial estimate of any applicable costs for the first installment of records before providing you with that installment, and will also provide you with a total estimate of the costs for the entire request when we are able.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nCheryl\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D7DA34.9E015140]<http://ckschools.org/>\r\nCheryl Portier - Administrative Assistant\r\nCentral Kitsap School District | Operations | P O Box 8, Silverdale, Wa., 98383\r\nPhone:  (360) 662-1616 | Fax:  (360) 662-1611 | Email:  cherylpo@ckschools.org<mailto:cherylpo@ckschools.org>\r\nFollow Us!

You had asked earlier that we let you know an estimate of final cost. The actual amount cannot be determined ahead of time. However many of the records are native electronic files that won\u2019t require printing or scanning. With that, overall estimate is under $300.  We will invoice you as production costs equal $5.00 or more.\r\nRegards,\r\nCheryl\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D908BC.8AF66E20]<http://ckschools.org/>\r\nCheryl Portier\r\nPhone:  (360) 662-1616\r\nEmail:  cherylpo@ckschools.org",

The office will provide an estimate of the time required to respond to the request, and may provide an estimate of copying costs pursuant to a specific request seeking an estimate of cost. If the requestor believes the amount of time or estimated costs stated are not reasonable, the requestor may petition the public records officer for a formal review under WAC 44-06-120.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this communication CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE of intent to seek relief via RCW 42.56.550 - Judicial review of agency actions.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of\r\nNat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\n*** CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE RCW 42.56.520 ***\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.  I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nCopies of the following entries from Clandestine Services Historical Series\r\nCSHP 105: Record of Paramilitary Action Against the Castro Government of Cuba, March 1960\r\nCSHP 163: The Evolution of Ground Paramilitary Activities at the Staff Level, October 1949-September 1955\r\nCSHP 183: Paramilitary Activities at the Staff Level (possibly Paramilitary Activities at the Staff Level, 15 Sep 55 - 31 Dec 61, II, 374- 375 (Mar 70).).\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have previously written about the government and its activities for AND Magazine, MuckRock and Glomar Disclosure and have an open arrangement with each. My articles have been widely read, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through the non-profit Internet Archive, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance. Additionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross-section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media. Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category. As such, my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available and I therefore request that fees be waived. That the records will be informative of the government's historical activities is demonstrated by the fact that these are the Agency's own histories. Thus, the Agency has already deemed them historically significant.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEmma Best",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJames Earl Ray (March 10, 1928 \u2013 April 23, 1998) was an American convicted of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Ray was convicted on his 41st birthday after entering a guilty plea to forgo a jury trial. Had he been found guilty by jury trial, he would have been eligible for the death penalty. He was sentenced to 99 years in prison. He later recanted his confession and tried unsuccessfully to gain access to a retrial. In 1998, Ray died in prison of complications due to chronic hepatitis C infection. His death has been widely reported. http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/24/us/james-earl-ray-70-killer-of-dr-king-dies-in-nashville.html?pagewanted=all\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

Specifically,  section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records,  the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,  unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.

Please provide all \"Public Records\" (as defined by WAC 44-14-03001) detailing costs incurred by your agency in fulfilling records requests, including staff compensation, legal review, and any public records related litigation costs and/or legal settlements for the year 2024 and complete copies of all records request realted fee payments paid to your agency in 2024.\r\n\r\nResponsive public records should include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nSupplies and services external services (e.g., printing services, large format printing) Mailing costs, supplies (CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, etc.) Staff compensation and benefit records, copies of payments of Public Records Fees Collected, Software licensing, public records portal and database software licensing and costs, purchases of equipment, hardware, software, and services to manage and retain public records or otherwise assist in the fulfillment of public records requests, professional services Agency staff costs, copies of billing for all Legal costs \u2013 including copies of all litigation Legal settlements related to public records requests litigation of any kind and copies of costs for staff time associated with invoicing and collection.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF RECORDS AND WRITINGS\r\n\r\nRECORDS AND WRITINGS as defined by RCW 42.56.010(4): any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide all records in their native electronic format. Please do not instead create new records by printing electronic files then scanning and printing the newly scanned prints.\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nConstructive Notice: Any and all communication(s) received on behalf of your agency in reference to this Public Records Request (RCW 42.45) from any unauthorized for-profit 3rd party company doing business outside the State of Washington will be the subject of a new public records request to your agency as to the origin and purpose of the communication as well as the identity of the sender of the communication.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nEMAIL RECORDS\r\n\r\nPlease provide any and all email records in NATIVE .pst electronic format.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nGood Luck.",

I respectfully request a review of this determination, as under the New York State Archives' ED-1 schedule, expense records such as those requested are required to be retained for at least six years following the end of the fiscal year in which they were created. Therefore, records from the 2017-2018 period should be available until at least end of 2024.\r\n\r\nGiven that these records fall within the retention period mandated by New York State guidelines, and considering the significance of transparency and accountability within public offices, I believe that these records should exist unless there is documented evidence of their lawful disposal according to the stated retention schedule.\r\n\r\nI request that the district review its records once more to ensure that no relevant documents have been overlooked and to provide a detailed explanation or documentation if it is concluded that the records have indeed been destroyed or are otherwise unavailable. Such transparency is crucial for public trust and the proper oversight of public resources.\r\n\r\nPlease advise me in writing of your decision regarding this appeal within ten business days as stipulated by Public Officers Law \u00a7 89(4)(a). Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMary Lee",

We hadn\u2019t inquired as to whether or not you may be interested in possibly narrowing the scope. At approximately 3098 pages, the request is currently in the large track. Please see the information below regarding track sizes and potential waiting times.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system:\r\nSmall track requests (0-50 pages) current average time is approximately 4 months to complete;\r\nMedium track requests (51-500 pages) current average time is approximately 41 months to complete;\r\nLarge track requests (501-4,999 pages) current average time is approximately 67 months to complete; and\r\nExtra-large track requests (over 5,000 pages) current average time is approximately 79 months to complete.\r\n\r\nThe current average time to complete your large track request is at least 67 months. Reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request to place it in a smaller, potentially faster processing track?\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if this is something you would be interested in further discussing. If you chose to narrow the scope of your request, you will be able to request remaining material via a new FOIPA request submission at the completion of this request, subject to applicable fees.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<http://www.fbi.gov/foia> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DA43AF.FFBB1740][cid:image002.png@01DA43AF.FFBB1740]\n",

A copy of one such record is attached. Based on my knowledge and belief this record consists of an excel spreadsheet including, at a minimum tabs covering  Master Schedule, Information Annex, Activities Annex, Athletics Annex.\r\n\r\nI note these documents are in electrnic format (Word, Excel, etc.) and should be provided in that format. Further, being stored in electronic format I anticipate they are readily accessible and so do not warrant a processing delay or search fees.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTom Nash, a citizen of Virginia, in coordination with Anonymous.",

Specifically, section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.

Please search all CPS email accounts as well as personal accounts used for public business. The log should include but not be limited to: sender, recipient(s), date and time, subject line, and attachment. \r\n\r\nThis request is made on behalf of The FOIA Bakery. Because this request is in the public interest for Illinois nonprofit The FOIA Bakery\u2019s work to advocate for public education, please waive any fees in accordance with 5 ILCS \u00a7 140/6(c). Feel free to contact me with any questions, or if clarification is needed. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. Please note that certain private information (personal email addresses, cell phone numbers, etc.) was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7. Specifically, section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. Student/parent information has been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5 (r) which exempts from inspection or copying information prohibited from being disclosed by the Illinois School Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA generally prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at is direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored.\u201d (105 ILCS 10/2(d). \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your Request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Leah Bartelt; Public Access Counselor Office of the Attorney General 500 South 2nd Street Springfield, Illinois 62706 E-mail: public.access@ilag.gov 877-299-3642 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court. 5 ILCS 140/11. If you choose to file a Request for Review with the PAC, you must do so within 60 calendar days of the date of this denial letter. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). Please note that you must include a copy of your original FOIA request and this denial letter when filing a Request for Review with the PAC.

The goal of this request is to ascertain if and how authorities have accessed information from the City of El Paso's database of Enhanced Library Card holders in recent months. \r\n\r\nTo that end, it's not necessary to search all city employees emails. Rather to fulfill the request conducting a search only of the employees emails who have access to the database and their superiors should suffice, which would likely include a small number of library employees and perhaps a small number of city IT employees, as well as city leadership to include the city attorney Karla Nieman, library director Norma Martinez, and mayor Renard U. Johnson who may have been alerted to or approved/denied such access. I'm unable to name all employees who may access to the database of Enhanced Library Card holders as I do not have an exhaustive city employee directory but I hope this clarification helps identify where responsive records may be. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if further clarification is needed.

The remote pilots in command are listed as Teague Mercer and R. Allen Gilbert Jr. The log says that \"Video or still images, Digital Orthophoto, DEM\" were collected for \"Multi-spectral mapping\" and a \"panoramic image of bison enclosure.\" \r\n\r\nI ask that all of the assets gathered be released. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

For the Grant Period 07/2024 - 12/2025 the NEA reports a grant of $1,146,200. \r\n\r\nThis N.E.A. money funds I.A.C. programs in various capacities. It can be inferred, for example, that at the city level, some of this funding is provided to the City of Evanston through the Evanston Arts Council (E.A.C.). \r\n\r\nThe specific breakdown of how these funds are divided up is not publicly available. The I.A.C. website instructs individuals to file a F.O.I.A. for cases where this information is desired. \r\n\r\nThat said, I request all communication between the Illinois Arts Council and the City of Evanston (including the E.A.C.) regarding grant money from June 2024 to the time that this request is processed. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would be greatly appreciated if you provided a detailed breakdown of N.E.A. funding allocated to the city of Evanston during this same time frame. \r\n\r\nIf applicable, I request that fees be waived as documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nSol Thomas",
