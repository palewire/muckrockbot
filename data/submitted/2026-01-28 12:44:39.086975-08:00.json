I will claim all applicable exceptions under law, seeking to withhold the records from public disclosure. The TxOAG will render a ruling within 45 to 55-business days. This process can take up to 90-business days to complete. Charges apply pending the TxOAG ruling.\r\nPlease respond and clarify/narrow your request within 61-days and advise me of how you wish for me to proceed, ie: (Please include if you seek the public copies in accordance with state exceptions, or do you seek a ruling from the TxOAG and agree to said charges?). Failure to respond within 61-days will result in an automatic withdraw of your request under TGC Sec. 552.222. If you wish to discuss how I may assist you in narrowing your request, please feel free to reach out and I will be happy to accommodate you. Please clarify and state if you seek the public copies under the exceptions listed within state law or if you seek a ruling submission from the Texas Office of the Attorney General in Austin. (public copies under 50-pages are provided electronically via e-mail at no charge). We do not waive open records/public information processing charges. We do not access links or attachments from outside sources for security reasons. We do not obtain drop box or similar access to our records.\r\nIf you have further inquiries or questions, please feel free to contact me and I will be happy to assist or direct you.\r\nTexas' open records laws are promulgated and set forth by Texas Legislature under the Texas Public Information Act. You may find a current version free-of-charge in .pdf format, desktop downloadable version on the Texas Office of the Attorney General's Website under the open government tab.

I've received your FOIA request for use of force records, and I have a couple of follow-up questions. We charge $15 per hour to retrieve and redact records. If you'd like to proceed with the request we can talk about the different classes of records and how long it will take to collect them. We've gone through a few different data systems in that period of time.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is South Carolina's FOIA statute creates a system for citizens to learn and report the activities of public officials. We are unable to provide a FOIA response to out of state inquiries.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in this information, please give me a call at 803 554 9123, and I may be able to provide an alternative route.\r\n\nThanks for your time,\r\nJason Allen",
