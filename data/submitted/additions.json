While the officer waited for backup, the female\u2019s boyfriend arrived and believed she was free to go. Police advised her she was under arrest for the pending charges with which she disagreed. While attempting to take her into custody, her boyfriend continuously interfered with police and ended up getting himself a ride to the county jail too.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMark D Nickelson",
