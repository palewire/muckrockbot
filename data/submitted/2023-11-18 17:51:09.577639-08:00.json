Flickinger, special agent for the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, during the period of 1975 through 1985. Special Agent Flickinger was tasked with investigating the claims of a convict name A. Kenneth Bankston who was serving time in Leavenworth Prison in Kansas for bank robbery. Bankston specifically claimed that a group named the \"Sons of Satan\" was perpetrating the cattle mutilations occurring in the Midwest during that period. Bankston originally contacted Ross Doyen, a Kansas state senator, with these claims. Additionally, a man named Jerome Clark began corresponding with Senator Doyen and Bankston about the claims that such a group existed. Bankston subsequently claimed that this group was also associated with individuals involved in the bombing of the \"Sterling Hall\" Army mathematics lab at the University of Wisconsin in 1970; the theft of plutonium related to the \"Karen Silkwood\" case in 1974; and that the group maintained a list of US politicians that they planned to assassinate. Federal and state law enforcement took Bankston's claims serious enough that Special Agent Flickinger corresponded with the United States District Attorney's Office in Minneapolis, Federal Judge Myles Lord, and the Warden at the Marion Penitentiary in 1975 to transfer Bankston to a minimal security facility. Special Agent Flickinger subsequently spent the next few months in 1975 officially investigating Bankston's claims. We request copies of all files and correspondence related to Donald E. Flickinger's investigation into the claims of A. Kenneth Bankston, and/or the \"Sons of Satan\" (or any other groups associated with Flickinger's investigation into Bankston's claims). We additionally request copies of all correspondence between Special Agent Flickinger,  J. Allen Hynek and Jerome Clark.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNathan Isaac",

He was born on 6 November 1949 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. He died on 14 November 2023.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE SUBJECT\r\n\r\nMr. Ahearn was a Republican White House official, political consultant, executive branch appointee, and campaigner. He worked for the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, Steve Forbes, Rudy Giuliani, and Donald Trump, as well as for several Vice Presidents. He served as the lead \"advanceman\" for President Ronald Wilson Reagan, and he was present at John Hinckley Jr.'s attempt on the President's life. Ahearn worked as regional representative of the U.S. Secretary of Labor, Raymond Donovan. He was also a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ahearn served as a campaign manager for a Ukrainian pro-Russian political party, the Party of Regions, in 2006. \r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH\r\nObituaries for Mr. Brown appeared in numerous national media, including NPR, https://www.npr.org/2023/05/19/1118051361/nfl-hall-of-fame-cleveland-browns-running-back-jim-brown-dead, the New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/sports/football/im-brown-dead.html, and ESPN (see attached).\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and organizations to see if they contain additional records related to Mr. Ahearn:\r\n\r\n(1) Ronald Wilson Reagan\r\n(2) John Hinckley Jr.\r\n(3) Party of Regions (Ukraine)\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Ahearn has recently died, so the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Mr. Ahearn was a public figure. He was a key figure in Republican presidential politics for over half a century, and he was present at one of the most dire moments of the Reagan presidency, when the President was shot by John Hinckley Jr. Thus, a broad segment of the public will likely be interested in these records.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Mr. Ahearn has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released until now.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

If you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am requesting more detailed data at more frequent intervals than is published here: https://mapyourtaxes.mo.gov/MAP/Download/Default.aspx. \r\n\r\nIf these data are not available at monthly intervals, please produce the datasets at the most frequent interval possible. For example, if the data is not available monthly, please produce the data at quarterly or annual intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please include any lookup tables that may be needed to interpret the data. For example, if departments are listed with codes linked to a separate table, I will be happy to join the records myself, rather than require your staff to do so.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable working with large data sets and can receive the records in a variety of formats (.dbf, .csv, .mdb, etc).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3.

For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7.

Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format.

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.

Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.

Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll training materials for the Defense Health Agency's \"Anomalous Health Incident (AHI) Acute Assessment Training 2022-2023\"  program, including a copy of Defense Health Agency form 244. This program is offered through the Defense Health Agency's Continuing Education Program Office (CEPO) and the Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence. A program description can be found on CEPO's site as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Anomalous Health Incident (AHI) Acute Assessment (Defense Health Agency (DHA) Form 244), is a multi-domain assessment that should be used to evaluate patients for potential AHI. This training will introduce learners to AHI and review assessment and recommended treatment strategies. Detailed guidance on how to complete a medical evaluation using DHA Form 244: AHI Acute Assessment will be provided. This interactive live training will include a combination of didactic lecture, demonstration, and group discussion. At the conclusion of this training, healthcare providers in attendance will have gained knowledge on how to perform a thorough assessment on individuals presenting for care after AHI exposure.\"\r\n\r\nPresenters for this course are identified as Miriam A. Roth, MS, PA-C, and Casey Becker, BSN, RN, CBIS.\r\n\r\nThe CEPO sub-site for the course identifies that there are options for live events and on-demand home study courses, both of which offer, at a minimum, a transcript of audio taken from a live presentation. It also states audio/video recordings of past presentations are available in certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe above information can be publicly accessed via CEPO's site: https://www.dhaj7-cepo.com/content/tbicoe-anomalous-health-incident-ahi-acute-assessment-training-2022-2023\r\n\r\nTherefore, in addition to any training materials offered with this course, I am also requesting copies of a presentation transcript and an audio/video recording of a live presentation.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to its research into anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAnomalous health incidents, also known as Havana Syndrome, are events occurring between 2016 and the present day that have resulted in a condition, or a series of related conditions, afflicting intelligence agents and diplomats working for the governments of the United States and Canada. In 2017, the Associated Press reported on a number of such incidents that happened in Cuba that led to the United States pulling staff from its embassy in that country. Since that time, anomalous health incidents have continued to generate media attention in major new outlets, with stories focusing on the national security implications appearing in the New York Times and The New Yorker, among many other publications. Speculation presently focuses on the use of directed energy weapons, or ranged weapons that attack a target with electromagnetic radiation like ultra-high frequency radio waves, as one possible cause for anomalous health incidents.\r\n\r\nAs of 2023, there have been over 200 reported anomalous health incidents, with many of the victims stating they were subject to attacks by directed energy weapons. Given that most of these individuals have been identified as high-ranking officials across multiple federal agencies, any programs that may be investigating anomalous health incidents and/or the effects of directed energy on humans would be the subject of considerable public interest. This is especially important in light of the fact that both Congress and the President approved compensation in the range of $140,000 to $187,000 per person to individuals diagnosed as suffering from anomalous health incidents under the HAVANA Act of 2021.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
