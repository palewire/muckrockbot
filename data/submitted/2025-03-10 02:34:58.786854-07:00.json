At the minimum VMI should be able to provide the communications involving how the Washington Post became aware of, requested, and were provided Mr. Watjen's resignation letter and the Superintendent's Statement on the BOV decision not to renew his contract immediately as these stories were just published recently with those documents.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Any records concerning the revocation of a visa or green card with respect to Mahmoud Khalil, who was arrested on or about March 8, 2025.\r\n\r\n2. Any communications with the White House concerning Mahmoud Khalil or the visa of any Columbia University student (or those of Columbia students generally). This request is limited to records generated on or after January 20, 2025.\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 22 CFR \u00a7 171.12(d)(1)(ii) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and free expression, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely the Department's involvement in the revocation of a visa or green card due to protest activity.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-mahmoud-khalil-ice-15014bcbb921f21a9f704d5acdcae7a8\r\nb. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-authorities-arrest-palestinian-student-protester-columbia-university-students-2025-03-09/\r\nc. https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/03/09/palestinian-activist-mahmoud-khalil-sipa-24-detained-by-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-lawyer-says/\r\nd. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/09/ice-arrests-palestinian-activist-columbia-protests\r\ne. https://nypost.com/2025/03/09/us-news/ice-arrests-palestinian-leader-of-columbias-anti-israel-protests-lawyer/\r\nf. https://zeteo.com/p/breaking-dhs-detains-palestinian\r\ng. https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/dhs-detains-columbia-university-student-gaza\r\nh. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14478989/pro-palestinian-Columbia-graduate-arrested-ICE-campus-protests.html\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 22 CFR \u00a7 171.16(j), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by United States officials in response to campus protests.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

Any communications to or from Interim United States Attorney Ed Martin containing any of the following terms: \"Georgetown\", \"George town\", \"George Washington\", \"teaching\", \"curriculum\", or \"DEI\". \r\n\r\n4. Any communications to or from Interim United States Attorney Ed Martin reflecting his letter's statement that \"It has come to my attention reliably that Georgetown Law School continues to teach and promote DEI.\"\r\n\r\n\"Communications\" means and includes emails, text messages, social media messages, letters, memoranda, calendar entries, chats, or any other form of one-to-one or one-to-many communication.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request seeks public records wherever they may be found, including on devices or networks owned or operated by private parties. For example, if an employee uses a personal cell phone or social media account to conduct public business, records created, maintained, or held on the phone or account are public records subject to this request.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.5(e)(1)(ii) and (iv) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and academic freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303. A substantial component of my duties as a staff member of FIRE is to obtain information through public records requests, including through the Freedom of Information Act, which I or my colleagues then share through FIRE's website and social media channels. I also publish news and other information of public concern via \"X\" (https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh) and \"Bluesky\" (https://bsky.app/profile/adamsteinbaugh.bsky.social).\r\n\r\n2. The requested information concerns an actual or alleged government activity, namely a United States Attorney's initiation of an \"inquiry\" into the academic content of courses at a private law school.\r\n\r\n3. The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below, which are helpful in establishing that there is an urgency to inform the public on this topic.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/05/dc-us-attorney-ed-martin-georgetown-law-dei/\r\nb. https://thepostmillennial.com/us-atty-ed-martin-demands-georgetown-law-school-answer-for-dei-in-curriculum-hiring-and-programs\r\nc. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html\r\nd. https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5181345-georgetown-law-school-dei-trump/\r\ne. https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-appointed-prosecutor-gets-much-needed-refresher-first-amendment-rcna195321\r\nf. https://www.rawstory.com/ed-martin-georgetown-clash/\r\ng. https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology\r\nh. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/ed-martin-us-attorney-dei\r\ni. https://www.newsmax.com/politics/georgetown-dei-william-treanor/2025/03/06/id/1201790/\r\nj. https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/federal-fallout/georgetown-law-school-wont-bow-to-dei-threat-from-dcs-acting-federal-prosecutor-ed-martin-donald-trump-william-treanor/65-22ac5a1d-43a8-492b-92db-1f8c6f70f76c\r\nk. https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/03/07/dei-georgetown-us-attorney-first-amendment/81793644007/\r\nl. https://www.washingtonian.com/2025/03/07/william-treanor-georgetown-law-ed-martin-first-amendment/\r\nm. https://abovethelaw.com/2025/03/georgetown-law-to-ed-martin-f-all-the-way-off/\r\nn. https://www.thecollegefix.com/top-d-c-federal-prosecutor-says-he-doesnt-want-law-students-from-georgetown-because-of-dei/\r\no. https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/03/georgetown-william-treanor-ed-martin-trump-doj-dei.html\r\n\r\n4. This information is relevant to a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence. There is widespread and exceptional media interest in this matter, as reflected in the above articles originating from outlets across the ideological spectrum. This matter raises \"possible questions\" about government integrity affecting public confidence because the alleged conduct involves a United States Attorney's pressure on a law school to limit viewpoints offered in classroom teaching protected by the First Amendment. A prominent First Amendment scholar has raised questions about the propriety of Attorney Martin's \"inquiry.\" Eugene Volokh, \"May Government Refuse to Hire Notre Dame Students, Because Notre Dame Teaches and Promotes Anti-Abortion Ideology?\" (Volokh Conspiracy, March 7, 2025), https://reason.com/volokh/2025/03/07/may-government-refuse-to-hire-notre-dame-students-because-notre-dame-teaches-and-promotes-anti-abortion-ideology. Further, Attorney Martin's letter was sent as members of the United States Senate requested disciplinary action against Attorney Martin due to his similar efforts to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment. See https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/ed-martin-us-attorney-washington-trump.html. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 28 CFR \u00a7 16.10(k), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to controversial conduct by an Interim United States Attorney.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations.\r\n\r\n3. Disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The requestor is a licensed attorney who practices First Amendment law. As such, the requestor will be able to effectively convey information to the public. Further, the requestor is a representative of the news media. The requestor and his employer, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, gather information of potential interest to a segment of the public, turns that information into distinct works (including through its news website, located at https://thefire.org/news), and distributes that information to the public. The information requested here relates to information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The requestor's past publication record (in addition to FIRE's articles available at https://thefire.org/news) is available at https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.\r\n\r\n4. The requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requestor works for a nonprofit organization and the records are not sought for a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAdam Steinbaugh",

A copy of the memo is available at https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jan/29/2003634987/-1/-1/1/RESTORING-AMERICAS-FIGHTING-FORCE.PDF.\r\n\r\nI request a copy of the \"initial report\" by the Task Force to the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. The initial report was due on or before March 1, 2025.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING:\r\n\r\nI request that this request be expedited under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.8(e)(1)(i)(B) for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I certify the following to be true and correct: My organization is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) maintains a news website at https://thefire.org/news, through which its staff members regularly publish news stories and editorial content concerning the activities of governments, government officials, and other persons or organizations of public concern. I am a staff member of FIRE. I frequently write about matters involving the First Amendment and press freedom, including on FIRE's website. See, e.g., https://www.thefire.org/news-archive?author=303.

The requested information extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally and instead has a particular value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis. The information pertains to a news story of public interest. That issue has attracted a wide range of news media coverage, including the numerous articles identified below. The information has value that would be lost if not processed on an expedited basis because it concerns the the Secretary's implementation of a presidential policy priority, and because the public's feedback on the \"initial report\" may impact the Task Force's final report, which is due on June 1, 2025. If that information is only disclosed months or years later, it will inhibit the ability of the public to understand how its current officials are making decisions.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent articles demonstrating the public's ongoing and current interest in this information include articles:\r\n\r\na. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-dod-creates-task-force-abolish-dei-offices-promote-systemic-racism\r\nb. https://www.dailywire.com/news/pentagon-guts-dei-programs-from-u-s-military\r\nc. https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5114409-pence-hegseth-military-promotions-race-sex/\r\nd. https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/01/hegseth-sets-up-pentagon-task-force-to-roll-back-diversity-programs-00201320\r\ne. https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-01-30/hegseth-dei-defense-department-promotions-academies-16654199.html\r\nf. https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2025/01/hegseth-stands-anti-dei-task-force/402623/\r\ng https://www.campusreform.org/article/hegseth-orders-end-affirmative-action-admissions-service-academies/27419\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Department itself published an article concerning the Task Force, reflecting its recognition that there is a public interest in timely information about it: https://www.defense.gov/news/news-stories/article/article/4047592/defense-secretary-directs-creation-of-task-force-to-restore-americas-fighting-f/\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER OR REDUCED FEES:\r\n\r\nI request, under 32 CFR \u00a7 286.12(l), a waiver or reduction of fees for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because its disclosure would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The requested information pertains specifically to the policies, procedures, and practices of senior Department officials concerning the Department's policies and programs.\r\n\r\n2. Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. Disclosure of the requested information would meaningfully inform the public about the Department's activities and operations, as the information pertains to the policies and underlying information driving decisions by senior Department officials. Disclosing the policies and other information would demonstrate the bases for those decisions, which have attracted substantial public attention, as demonstrated by the articles cited above.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Vermont Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRecords held by the Vermont Department for Children and Families (DCF) concerning the investigation and its resolution involving an Ezra M. Miller\u2019s property in Stamford, Vermont in August 2022, as chronicled in the Rolling Stone article titled 'The Ezra Miller Saga Now Involves Vermont\u2019s Child Services Department' (published August 10, 2022, available at: https://web.archive.org/web/20241215093133/https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/ezra-miller-vermont-child-services-department-1392572/). \r\nThe article details attempts by Vermont State Police to serve an emergency care order on August 6, 7, and 9, 2022, at a 96-acre farm in Stamford, intended to remove a 25-year-old mother and her three children amid reported welfare concerns, with DCF overseeing the inquiry and potential involvement of the Vermont Attorney General\u2019s Office in legal proceedings. Notably, the article includes a quote from an individual suggesting the property owner was attempting to \"avoid\" or conceal matters related to the investigation, raising additional questions about the events.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I seek the following records from August 6, 2022, through December 31, 2023:  \r\n\r\nDCF Investigation Records:\r\nReports, case notes, or findings related to the welfare of the mother and her three children at the Stamford property, including any assessments or investigations prompting the emergency care order issued in August 2022; plus any follow-up records documenting the resolution or subsequent actions taken regarding their welfare after August 9, 2022.  \r\n\r\nCorrespondence and Legal Coordination:\r\nCorrespondence (e.g., emails, memos, or letters) between DCF and Vermont State Police or the Vermont Attorney General\u2019s Office regarding the emergency care order, its execution, or its outcome; records of any hearing referenced in the article scheduled on or after August 11, 2022, including notices, outcomes, or related communications.  \r\n\r\nInter-Agency Coordination:\r\nDocumentation of DCF\u2019s oversight or coordination with Vermont State Police and the Vermont Attorney General\u2019s Office concerning the welfare of the mother and her three children or the execution of the emergency care order; if any responsive records are held by other agencies (even out-of-state agencies), I request coordination with that agency or referral of my request to the appropriate agency to ensure relevant obtainable documents are obtained.\r\n\r\nI request that any exempt personal information (e.g., names of minors or private individuals) be redacted rather than withholding documents entirely, consistent with the Vermont Public Records Act\u2019s presumption of disclosure (1 V.S.A. \u00a7 315 et seq.).\r\nI am not affiliated with any news agencies & this request is not being made for commercial purposes. This inquiry serves the public interest by shedding light on the resolution of a widely publicized matter (yet for some reason never followed up on by news organizations) involving child welfare and inter-agency action, fostering transparency in governmental proceedings, and discouraging vigilante justice from members of the public who, due to rampant disinformation by omission, might be inclined to take matters into their own hands against a perceived child abductor.\r\n\r\nIf there are any issues with the scope or specificity of this request, please contact me to discuss it before denying or delaying the response.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPJ",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nBy way of background:\r\n\r\nAround roughly January 30 and thereafter, several news organizations (including Washington Post, ScienceInsider, Nature's news division) began reporting that NSF employees were reviewing or vetting existing awards based off of a list of keywords relevant to recent executive orders. Among other things, the reporting described the process by which these grants were vetted along with specific documents associated to this process, which primarily the information sought in this request.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1.) A complete list or a document including such a list of keywords used in this vetting process, which should have been created on or after January 20, 2025. To assist in finding such a list, keywords/phrases released by news organizations included: advocacy, antiracist, barrier, biases, cultural relevance, disability, diverse backgrounds, diversity, diversified, ethnicity, excluded, exclusion, equity, female, gender, hate speech, historically, implicit bias, inclusion, inclusive, inequalities, institutional, intersectional, male dominated, marginalized, minority, multicultural, oppression, polarization, racially, segregation, systemic, trauma, underrepresented, underserved, victims, women.\r\n\r\n2.) Information about a vetting process that concerned that list of keywords and active awards, and which was undertaken after January 20, 2025, and at least between but not limited to February 3-7, 2025, including:\r\n\r\n2a.) Internal documents regarding this keyword vetting process such as reports, memorandums, meeting minutes, or notes, including but not limited to: a flowchart used to evaluate whether a research project should be flagged for further review, an internal email sent as an update clarifying \"edge cases\" concerning flagged awards that may be in violation of policies, a document or communications containing the criteria for flagging grants and what to look for (such as \"discriminatory programs, including illegal DEI\") sent to or intended for program officers.\r\n\r\n2b.) The complete list or relevant spreadsheets of awards initially selected by NSF senior managers for vetting by NSF employees, said to have numbered at around 10,000 out of 50,000 active awards.\r\n\r\n2c.) The complete list or relevant spreadsheets of awards after the initial stage in the vetting process allegedly flagged to contain two or more keywords, said to have numbered at around 1,200 awards. The spreadsheets in question may have been supposed to be finalized on February 3, 2025 at 5:00 pm.\r\n\r\n2d.) The complete list or relevant spreadsheets of awards remaining after the final step in the vetting process, including if available any actions or proposed actions (such as termination) against these grants. The spreadsheets in question may have been supposed to be finalized on February 7, 2025.\r\n\r\n2e.) Any documents or communications generated by the Office of the Director on or after February 7, 2025 concerning the final decision of the awards remaining after the final step in the vetting process, including written justifications for grant cancellations or modifications.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf the requested information requires relevant persons identities to not be disclosed (such as employee reviewers), please add redactions to the records wherever required.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I am willing to pay fees regarding my request provided I have received information on the total charges. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDaisy McDonald",
