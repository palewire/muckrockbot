A summary was provided in  a 1971 Domestic Intelligence Division inspection report: \u201cBANPOP is the code name for a program initiated in August, 1966, in an attempt to identify illegals in the U. S. who may be receiving funds through Swiss banks. The basis for the program was an analysis of four Soviet illegal cases between 1955 and 1966 in which the Banque Populaire Swisse of Switzerland was used by the Soviets to fund illegals. The transfers are screened with the following criteria: (1) the person or individual beneficiary is named; (2) the amount of the transfer is between $300 and $5000 and (3) the last name of the person ordering and receiving is the same of of the money and is directed to a specific bank account.\u201d (https://archive.org/details/FBI-Church-Committee-File/62-116395-441-475/page/4/mode/2up, https://archive.org/details/FBI-Church-Committee-File/62-116395-586-Bulky2/page/126/mode/2up) This is to include file 65-HQ-70741 and any associated bulky files, sub-files, and enclosures behind file.\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. This is also to include any responsive records held in offsite locations, such as the Alexandria Records Center. Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory records in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please include both investigatory and non-investigatory\r\nrecords in your search. If any potentially responsive records have been\r\ndestroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction\r\nor transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning\r\nor describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to\r\nconfirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If\r\npreviously released records are available, then I request a rolling release\r\nconsisting of those records while additional records are located and processed\r\nfor release. The requested documents will be made available to the general\r\npublic, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In the\r\nevent that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the\r\ntotal charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request\r\nfilled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
