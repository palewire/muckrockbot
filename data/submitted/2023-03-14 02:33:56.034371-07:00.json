I understand that the collection of vital statistics data is governed by a set of procedures and protocols that must be followed, and I urge the department to take all necessary steps to ensure compliance with these requirements.\r\n\r\nIf the department is not able to locate these records, I would appreciate it if you could direct me to the appropriate agency that does.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your response.
