        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nRequested Info:\r\n\r\nOn behalf of my non-profit organizational employer, Capital Area Immigrants' Rights (CAIR) Coalition, I request all the data and documents reviewed and utilized by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in preparing Table 2 of the report titled \"ICE Faces Barriers in Timely Repatriation of Detained Aliens\" and dated March 11, 2019. https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2019-03/OIG-19-28-Mar19.pdf \r\n\r\nThe report includes a \"case review of 3,053 aliens not removed within 90 days of receiving a final order of removal,\" based on a snapshot of case dispositions as of March 24, 2018. On page 28, in Appendix C, \"Results of Electronic File Case Review,\" there is a table titled \"Table 2: Snapshot Case Dispositions.\" The source for Table 2 is identified as: \u201cOIG Analysis of Aliens Detained Longer than 90 Days Post Final Order of Removal, from ICE ENFORCE Alien Removal Module, ICE Law Enforcement Systems and Analysis case disposition information as of March 24, 2018.\u201d \r\n\r\nI request all the \"case disposition information\" from the \"Aliens Detained Longer than 90 Days Post Final Order of Removal\" section within the ICE ENFORCE Alien Removal Module, in its original form as provided to OIG for purposes of the report. In addition, I request all documents and/or tables created by OIG in the course of conducting its \"[a]nalysis\" of the aforementioned data.\r\n\r\nRequest for Waiver of Fees:\r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests that ICE waive all fees associated with this request. Such a request is warranted on the grounds that disclosure of the information contained in the requested record is in the public interest and is \u201clikely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(1). Disclosure of this information is in the public interest of understanding in what circumstances ICE will continue to detain non-citizens after 90 days of post-removal order detention. As previously indicated, CAIR Coalition is a nonprofit organization recognized as a 501(c)(3) entity by the Internal Revenue Service that provides legal services and information to immigrant populations and information to the public on immigration issues.  \r\n\r\nDisclosure of the requested information also will contribute to \u201cunderstanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.10(k)(2)(ii)(B). The requested information will be used to better equip pro bono practitioners\u2014both at CAIR Coalition and at other pro bono organizations assisting detained non-citizens in similar circumstances. As a provider of legal services to detained non-citizens, CAIR Coalition has the necessary expertise, capacity, and intention to review, analyze, and synthesize this information and make it accessible to a broad audience of attorneys and clients in immigration proceedings. In addition to the requested information being publicly available on Muckrock, the platform through which I am filing this FOIA request, CAIR Coalition has the capacity to convey the information to a broad audience on CAIR Coalition's website, which receives more than 10,000 monthly visitors. CAIR Coalition also will circulate a summary of information disclosed through this request on its listservs, in which approximately 2,500 attorneys participate. Additionally, CAIR Coalition shares information in its newsletter, which is directly distributed to 6,000 recipients. \r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition is also \u201ca representative of the news media\u201d within the meaning of the statute and applicable regulations. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) (defined as \u201cany . . . entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience,\u201d); Nat. Sec. Archive v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 880 F.2d 1381, 1397 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (same); Electronic Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Dep\u2019t of Defense, 241 F. Supp. 2d 5 (D.D.C. 2003) (non-profit that published information in a wide variety of sources on topics of privacy and civil liberties qualified as representative of news media for FOIA purposes). Given that FOIA's fee waiver requirements are to be \u201cliberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters,\u201d a waiver of all fees is justified and warranted in this instance. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Rossotti, 326 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted). \r\n\r\nRequest for Expedited Processing: \r\n\r\nCAIR Coalition requests Track 1 expedited treatment for this FOIA request. There is a compelling need for expedited processing, namely, an \u201curgency to inform the public concerning the actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). CAIR Coalition is aware of at least ten individuals who are currently detained by ICE past the 90-day removal period, including four detained after being granted withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. These individuals need information about ICE\u2019s policies and practices in order to understand the basis for their detention and advocate for their release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nIan Austin Rose",
