It should also be determined where responsibility was illegal or could have led to the attack itself. This information is of great value to all students and parents but also to those who seek budgetary constraints on certain forms of law enforcement.\r\n\r\nThese records of agreement, payment/exchange, bid, will serve as a directory and will provide means for third parties (person/organization/business/Agency) providing any form of security to LAUSD property to be rightfully contacted for questions and to release details pertaining to  educational communities historic protections, insurance, regulations regarding liaison with Law Enforcement Agencies, whether or not that occurred before-during-after the specific event referenced here, and all violent incidents prior/ those potentially occuring today.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRemy No\u00ecchlaf",
