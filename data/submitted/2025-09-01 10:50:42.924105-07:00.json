Internal guides, handbooks, doctrine, or tradecraft materials that describe thresholds for effective information asymmetry (e.g., how much the public must or must not know for an operation to succeed).\r\n6. Metrics, models, or evaluations that measure the level of public awareness/ignorance required for successful influence operations.\r\n7. Collections of narrative templates, messaging frameworks, or \u201cbest practices\u201d for framing, agenda-setting, normalization, distraction, or division designed to mask or camouflage manipulation.\r\nSuggested program keywords to aid your search (non-exhaustive):\r\nOffice of Policy Coordination (OPC), OSS (Office of Strategic Services), psychological warfare, propaganda, influence operations, perception management, disinformation, active measures, Operation Mockingbird, \u201cbehavioral\u201d or \u201ccognitive\u201d influence, audience segmentation, plausible deniability, limited hangout, media assets, error vs manipulation, information asymmetry.\r\nIf portions of these records are exempt, please release all reasonably segregable material.
