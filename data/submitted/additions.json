Since your request is for archival\r\nrecords (records created by or originated in a different agency, but that\r\nmay have been transferred to the legal custody of NARA) to which access may\r\nbe restricted, we are forwarding it by this email to our Office of Research\r\nServices, Special Access and FOIA staff who handle FOIA requests for such\r\narchival records.\r\n\r\nThat office will assign your request a tracking number, and respond\r\ndirectly to you.
