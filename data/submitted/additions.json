I will prepay the actual cost of the storage medium and postage costs incurred if the records cannot be emailed per KRS 61.874(2) and (3).\r\n\r\nPlease note that this request is being made SOLELY for ACADEMIC purposes, as I am a graduate student doing research. This is not being used for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
