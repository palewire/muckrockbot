Seymour, as described in the article titled \"Potsdam police officer charged with choking person while in police station,\" published on April 28, 2023.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nCopies of all incident reports, including but not limited to the initial incident report, subsequent investigative reports, and any related documentation.\r\nCopies of any audio or video recordings, including but not limited to footage from surveillance cameras, body-worn cameras, or any other recording devices that captured the incident or its aftermath.\r\nAny records of disciplinary actions taken against Matthew A. Seymour by the Village of Potsdam Police Department, including the notice of discipline signed by Mayor Ron Tischler on April 25, 2023.\r\nAny correspondence or communication, including emails, letters, memoranda, or other written exchanges, between the Village of Potsdam Police Department, the St. Lawrence County District Attorney's Office, the county Sheriff's Office, and the state Attorney General's Law Enforcement Misconduct Investigation Office regarding this incident.\r\nAny court documents, including the appearance ticket issued to Matthew A. Seymour for Potsdam Town Court, and any subsequent court proceedings or rulings related to this incident.\r\nAny documents related to the order of protection issued for the victim involved in this incident.\r\nAny records, reports, or findings from the 2015 investigation into the fatal stabbing at Swan Landing involving Matthew A. Seymour and Tian Ma.\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, relevant state court cases have established the importance of transparency and the public interest in accessing such records. In Doe v. Karpa, 524 N.Y.S.2d 176 (N.Y. App. Div. 1988), the court recognized the public's right to access records related to police misconduct. Similarly, in Schreiber v. City of Potsdam, 637 N.Y.S.2d 148 (N.Y. App. Div. 1996), the court affirmed the public's interest in obtaining records regarding law enforcement actions.\r\n\r\nAs an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. Therefore, I kindly request a fee waiver for the processing of this request.\r\n\r\nIf the fee waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\nPhone: +1 845-218-0299\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com.

Albert Fentress is a convicted criminal who gained notoriety for his involvement in the abduction, rape, and murder of a college student in Poughkeepsie in the late 1980s. Fentress was arrested, tried, and convicted for these heinous crimes, and his case has been a subject of public interest and scrutiny for several years.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there have been further allegations against Albert Fentress, including suspicions of involvement in other unsolved cases of a similar nature. These allegations have raised concerns within the community and have sparked discussions about the extent of Fentress's criminal activities. Therefore, I believe it is crucial to access the requested records to shed light on these allegations and provide a comprehensive understanding of the investigations conducted by the City of Poughkeepsie Police Department.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nArrest records and charging documents related to Albert Fentress.\r\nCourt records, including judgments, verdicts, and sentencing information.\r\nPolice reports, incident reports, and any other investigative documents related to Albert Fentress.\r\nCorrespondence and communications, including emails, letters, memoranda, or any other written exchanges mentioning or involving Albert Fentress.\r\nAny audio or visual recordings, such as interviews, interrogations, or surveillance footage related to Albert Fentress.\r\nAny internal memos, policies, or guidelines concerning the handling of Albert Fentress's case.\r\nGiven the profound impact of Albert Fentress's crimes on the community and the ongoing interest in understanding the scope of his criminal activities, accessing these records will contribute significantly to the public's understanding of the operations and activities of the City of Poughkeepsie Police Department.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C.

Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I firmly believe that the information I seek is in the public interest, and its disclosure will greatly contribute to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\nPhone:845 218 0299\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com.

As per RCW 42.56.520(3)(a) since your request for records is unclear our office will not be able to accept your public records request as written, we require clarification before searching for any records. \r\nPlease clarify the following: What Department or Office are you wishing to receive records from? Your request currently reads \"All current \"Brady lists\" and \"Giglio lists\" (per Brady v. Maryland/Giglio v. United States) maintained by your office.\" Ferry County Public Records does not hold or maintain a Brady List but the Ferry County Prosecuting Attorney's Office may. \r\n\r\nA request under the Public Records Act must be for an identifiable public record, see Hangartner v. City of Seattle, 151 Wn.2d 439, 447-48, 90 P.3d 26 (2004), and a mere request for information does not so qualify. Wood v. Lowe, 102 Wn.App. 872, 879, 10 P.3d 494 (2000); Bonamy v. City of Seattle, 92 Wn.App. 403, 410-12, 960 P.2d 447 (1998), review denied, 137 Wn.2d 1012 (1999). Local governments are not required to create documents in order to comply with a request for specific information. Citizens for Fair Share v. State Dep\u2019t of Corrections, 117 Wn.App. 411, 435, 72 P.3d 206 (citing Smith v. Okanogan County, 100 Wn.App. 7, 13-14 (2000)). See also WAC 44-14-04003(5). Nor are local governments obligated to compile information from various records so that information is in a form that is more useful to the requestor. Instead, they must produce existing records for review and copying. \r\n\r\nAs per RCW 42.56.520(3)(b) if you fail to respond to our request for clarification within 15 days from the date of this letter, we will presume your request has been abandoned and we will close our file. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nMarah Hulse \r\nFerry County Public Records Officer",
