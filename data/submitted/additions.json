Specifically, I am requesting a list of all people currently or formerly incarcerated for a drug-free zone violation from 2015 to the date that this request is processed. The list should include names, date of conviction, date of end of sentence, offenses convicted of, inmate ID, facility type (ie. state prison, local jail) and parole eligibility date.I would also like to request any demographic information that may be readily available for the above persons, such as, but not limited to, each person\u2019s date of birth, age at arrest, current age, race, ethnicity and gender. If this time frame is overly burdensome, please provide a date range that can be fulfilled.\r\nIn addition, I am requesting a copy of any and all reports or studies generated by the state that discuss the passage and efficacy of the drug free zone law.\r\nIf there are any fees for obtaining or copying these records, please inform me should the cost exceed $100. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees as I am requesting the information on behalf of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of drug free zone laws. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\nIf possible, please provide the requested documents electronically in Excel format.

Further, if you expect a significant delay in responding to this request, please contact me with information concerning when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption that justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\nJenny Wadhwa",
