Any publicly posted solicitation for such contracts or agreements;\r\n  3.  All bids received for each procurement;\r\n  4.  All bid evaluations for all bids;\r\n  5.  The final scoring sheets for each procurement.\r\n\r\nWe have determined that the Judicial Council has the correct disclosable responsive records.  Portions of the records have been redacted pursuant to rule 10.500(e)(1)(C), (f)(3).)\r\n\r\nThe file sizes exceed the limits of our e-mail server; therefore, we are providing you the records using a secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) site.\r\n\r\nTo retrieve the requested records, open your web browser and follow the steps below.\r\n\r\n1.     Go to https://ftp.jud.ca.gov<https://ftp.jud.ca.gov/> and the login box for the SFTP site will appear.\r\n2.     Type in the user name: pajarguest.\r\n3.

Select the location where you want to save each file and click OK.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to use Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge, the instructions are almost the same.  The only difference would be that, in the fifth step, you would open files from a pop-up box on the screen.  If you have difficulties, you may need to hit refresh, check your network settings, or check your firewall settings. The documents will be available for download from the SFTP site for approximately 7 to 10 days.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the SFTP site will lock you out if the system detects any of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n  *   your computer or device is seeking to connect from a malicious or unsafe server;\r\n  *   your computer or device contains potentially infected software;\r\n  *   you have made too many login attempts in a short interval; or\r\n  *   you made too many unsuccessful login attempts in a short interval.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that we cannot offer specific technical assistance if you have difficulty using the SFTP site.  If this occurs, we can make alternative arrangements to provide the responsive records such as by mailing a flash drive or hard copies, or by arranging an in-person inspection.  You would be responsible for the costs of any copying, shipping, handling, or materials in such circumstances.  (Cal.

RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your FOIA request are available to download via the Chicago Public Schools FOIA Center. Please visit the following link and enter your username and password to access the records: http://cps.edu/About_CPS/Departments/Law/Pages/FOIARequest.aspx Under the rules of FOIA, private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Be advised that private information and unique identifiers contained within public records are exempt from public disclosure; that data has been withheld, including Federal Tax Identification Number and other bank information. Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(g), \u201cTrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person or business where the trade secrets or commercial or financial information are furnished under a claim that they are proprietary, privileged or confidential, and that disclosure of the trade secrets or commercial or financial information would cause competitive harm on the person or business, and only insofar as the claim directly applies to the records requested.\u201d Additionally, records have been redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(m): Communications between a public body and an attorney or auditor representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body, and materials prepared or compiled with respect to internal audits of public bodies. Furthermore, 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f) exempts any \u201cPreliminary drafts, notes, recommendations,\u00a0memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body.\u201d Lastly, identifiable student information included within records are exempt from disclosure pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7.5(r) in accordance with Illinois Student Records Act (ISSRA). ISSRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201cschool student records\u201d and defines a \u201cschool student record\u201d as \u201cany writing or other recorded information concerning a student and by which a student may be individually identified, maintained by a school or at its direction or by an employee of a school, regardless of how or where the information is stored. 105 ILCS 10/(d): Release of a minor\u2019s record may only be authorized by the parent or guardian in accordance with the Illinois Student Records Act (105 ILCS 10/1 et seq.). You have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a). You can file your request for Review with the PAC by writing to: Public access Counselor, Office of the Attorney General, 500 South 2 nd Street, Springfield, Illinois, 62706, FAX: 217-782-1396, E-mail: publicaccess@atg.state.il.us .

Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-500 pages), large (501-4,999 pages), and extra-large (5,000 and over pages) sub-tracks are based upon request size.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the extra-large track and reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing, allow for a timelier receipt of the information you seek, and reduce the duplication costs, if applicable.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us with regards to this inquiry to let us know if you are still interested in receiving records for this request either in full (the remaining records), or reducing the request to a faster processing track.\r\nIf you reduce the size, you may request remaining, additional records by submitting a new FOIPA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov<mailto:Fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nStatus Checks: https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/@@search-fdps<https://usg02.safelinks.protection.office365.us/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvault.fbi.gov%2Ffdps-1%2F%40%40search-fdps&data=05%7C01%7CAFBlend%40fbi.gov%7Cef5fe3baab334cf5ff7008db37714b69%7C022914a9b95f4b7bbace551ce1a04071%7C0%7C0%7C638164731949044663%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=B6S2vFgDgOWQqiCCwRvUsZQgDAHF1diXKG5fYH3T12M%3D&reserved=0> | foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\nFor additional information, please visit the www.fbi.gov/foia<https://usg02.safelinks.protection.office365.us/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fbi.gov%2Ffoia&data=05%7C01%7CAFBlend%40fbi.gov%7Cef5fe3baab334cf5ff7008db37714b69%7C022914a9b95f4b7bbace551ce1a04071%7C0%7C0%7C638164731949044663%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=uaXvm%2Fg3l2HzET7puRKzFvk4XQEvSW%2FUHofbeKfFAng%3D&reserved=0> website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D9F6A0.23F1CDF0][Logo, company name  Description automatically generated]",

Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPlease note that certain private information (signatures and personal addresses) was redacted pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7. Specifically, section 7(1)(b) which exempts certain private information as defined by section 2(c-5) and section 7(1)(c) which exempts personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subject of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. Please note that all other records are being withheld entirely pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(f) at this time as factual information inextricably intertwined in ongoing investigation and processes as well as 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(n), which exempts from release records relating to the adjudication of employee discipline and grievance matters except for records reflecting the final outcome. \r\nMoreover, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(d)(ii) records in the possession of any public body created in the course of administrative enforcement proceedings, and any law enforcement or correctional agency for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that disclosure would interfere with active administrative enforcement proceedings conducted by the public body that is the recipient of the request. \r\nYou have a right to have the denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at the Office of the Illinois Attorney General. 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a).

Second, the request includes \"communications...to or from...any person employed by the State of Georgia Government, on the one hand, and any elected official...or any member of the staff of an elected official, on the other hand.\" Interpreted literally and applied to the Office of the Governor, this would essentially cover every email sent to or from our office to any state employee, regardless of subject or keywords. This is likely to return thousands of documents and incur significant costs. Please confirm whether this is the intended scope of your request.\r\n\r\n  3.\r\nPlease clarify the scope of this request. Similar to part (2), this request includes \"communications...to or from...any person employed by the State of Georgia Government, on the one hand, and any elected official...or any member of the staff of an elected official, on the other hand.\" With the inclusion of the specified keywords, there are likely to be somewhat fewer responsive documents, but I am not sure whether this is the intended scope.\r\n\r\n     *\r\nTo the extent that this request was intended to cover only communications between employees of or persons associated with the University of Georgia, on the one hand, and the Office of the Governor, on the other, the responsive records would be identical to those provided to you on May 8th (attached).\r\n  4.\r\n\r\n  5.\r\nThere is no request following \"4\" below.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you would like us to interpret this request, and if you wish, provide any additional clarification to your request. We can then provide you an estimate of the response time or the fees, if any.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nSam Hatcher\r\n\r\nDeputy Executive Counsel\r\n\r\nOffice of Governor Brian P. Kemp\r\n\r\nsam.hatcher@georgia.gov |(404) 971-0097",

Specifically, I request the following information:\r\n\u2022\tThe total number of FOIA requests received on a quarterly basis.\r\n\u2022\tA breakdown of these requests by status: approved, rejected, in-progress, or any other relevant status.\r\n\u2022\tIf available, a log file or similar record detailing individual requests and their respective statuses for each quarter.\r\n\r\nI require this data for academic research purposes, in association with Duke University and Boston University. The study aims to analyze the trends and efficiency in the processing of FOIA requests by major public institutions. For comprehensiveness, I request that this information be provided for as far back as records are available.\r\n\r\nPlease inform me of any potential charges before processing this request. If certain parts of this request are exempt from release, please provide the non-exempt portions.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your consideration of this request and look forward to your prompt response. According to the Freedom of Information Law, you have 28 business days to respond to this letter.

REV. STAT. \u00a7 84-712(4). The Nebraska public records statute allows persons the right to examine public records in the possession of public agencies during normal agency business hours, to make memorandum and abstracts from those public records, and to obtain copies of public records in certain circumstances. The statute do not require a public agency to review documents and create abstracts or other lists, to answer questions, or to create documents that do not otherwise exist. See NEB.REV.STAT. \u00a7 84-712. Although the Nebraska public records statutes provided for access to public documents, such access is not absolute. The statutes also provide for exceptions to disclosures by express and special provisions; there are 21 categories of documents that may be kept confidential from the public at the discretion of the agency involved. See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 84-712.05. Your request is denied in part and approved in part. Your request for the various administrative social media settings Facebook and Twitter, and the content within them is denied.\u00a0 Even though the social media sites are open to the public for viewing and posting of comments, the information you are requesting is not for public dissemination pursuant to NEB.REV.STAT. 84-712.05. The Public Information Office (PIO) manages the Omaha Police Department's social media sites.\u00a0 I have been told they do have a list of approximately 200 individuals blocked and banned from the early onset of our use of social media.\u00a0 I am told that no one has been blocked or banned from our social media sites in several years.\u00a0 We value the foundation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and as such we do not encourage blocking or banning citizens from our social media sites.

Please disclose these records in the format in which they are kept, e.g., .ppt, .pptx, .doc, or .docx.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rule of the CPRA is a presumption of public access. \u201cIn other words, [A]ll public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.\u201d Williams v. Superior Court, 5 Cal. 4th 337 (1993). This presumption finds further support in the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59 in 2004. \u201cA statute, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.\u201d Cal. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 3(b)(2).\r\n\r\nPlease provide a determination on this request within 10 days of your receipt of it. If you determine that any or all of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, please note whether, as is normally the case, the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and that you intend to withhold it, please redact it for the time being and make the rest available as requested. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nPlease apply a fee waiver to this request. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please provide notification of any duplication costs exceeding $50 before you duplicate the records. If the request for a fee waiver is denied, please further provide an index of all other requests since 2018 for which a fee waiver was denied, and the reason therefore.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request and disclose the records electronically by email to this MuckRock email address. Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help ensure this request is the least burdensome possible for your agency while providing a correct and full disclosure in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email at dillon@muckrock.com, or by phone at (267) 314-7952.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDillon Bergin",

Therefore, even if a decedent no longer has a privacy interest, the family member(s) have a privacy interest over the disclosure of information contained within an autopsy report. For instance, a decedent may not have a right to privacy over their medical history, but the surviving family member does. Accordingly, families hold a substantive due process right under the 14th Amendment and that information should be redacted to protect their privacy interests.

Once that is complete, we will then provide the information to the departments for them to notify their employees.  This request will take a little longer to provide since each month requires a separate downloading and exporting of the 20,000+ employee information. Please note that our HR system that maintains these records was not implemented until June 2001.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nTSS",

\r\n\r\n--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n Public Records Request: P003584-042124 \r\n \r\n   \r\n  \r\n RE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of April 21, 2024 Reference # P003584-042124 Dear Requester, I am writing in response to your public records request of April 21, 2024, in which you requested the following: Any records relating to reports and complaints filled by researchers (students and faculty) about concern to animal health and safety across the University of Wisconsin schools including the School of Medicine and Public Health, the School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences from January, 1, 2023- present day. Access the Public Records Center to download the responsive records.  Under the Wisconsin Public Records Laws, records custodians must carefully weigh the competing public interests involved when deciding to release any record in their possession.\u00a0 Custodians begin with a presumption of complete public access to such records.\u00a0 However, custodians must consider whether inspection of the record could result in harm to the public interest that would outweigh the benefits of such inspection.\u00a0 When such harm substantially outweighs the benefits of public inspection, such records, or portions thereof, must remain confidential. Additional information has been provided with this request to inform the requestor of steps taken to address complaints included in this reply. Material not related to the steps taken in response to these complaints has been removed from the meeting minutes provided. This is not a redaction of records. The additional records provided are not responsive to the request; they are merely something the university has chosen to provide for additional information. Personally identifiable information of individuals engaged in or supporting animal research: Pursuant to an application of the balancing test inherent in Wisconsin\u2019s public records law, we have made the specific determination that the public interest in safeguarding and preventing the harassment of individuals involved in animal research outweighs the public interest in compelled disclosure of their personally identifying information. Furthermore, by applying the balancing test inherent in the public records law, we have determined that the public policy interest in maintaining the university\u2019s competitive position outweighs the interest in disclosing the personally identifiable information of our employees, students, collaborators, and other supporters of animal research. This determination aligns with Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.85(1)(e), permitting the closure of publicly held meetings for competitive reasons. We\u2019ve specifically determined that disclosing personally identifiable information about individuals engaged in or supporting animal research would jeopardize the university's competitive standing (Cf. Wis. Stat. \u00a719.35(1)(a), incorporating public policy expressed in \u00a719.85(1)(e).). For instance, revealing such information could lead to threats or harassment, potentially prompting talented staff or students to seek employment or educational opportunities elsewhere. Additionally, it could strain vital research partnerships. The departure of skilled personnel or students would diminish the university's standing compared to its competitors, hindering its ability to serve the State effectively. The considerable public interest in the ongoing social and economic benefits stemming from university research outweighs any marginal interest in the specific names contained in these records. We have also considered that any public interest in these records is fully satisfied by the substantial information being released, and not harmed by redactions to the identity of specific persons. References to animal research locations (locations and housing) and full denial of a video: Applying the public records law balancing test, we determined that the public interest in protecting university research facilities, activities, and personnel from criminal interference, disorderly conduct, vandalism and other disruption of lawful research and academic activities outweighs the public interest in knowing the exact locations of research animals and facilities. Specific locations have been denied and in the case of one complaint that included a video, the video is denied in total. There is no means to redact the video to a point where it could be unidentifiable of location. The complaint itself is provided redacted for identifiable information only. This determination is supported by Wis. Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 16.851 and 19.36(9), which shield plans and specifications of state-owned and state-leased buildings from disclosure, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding such information. Additionally, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.85(1)(d) permits the closure of meetings to discuss crime prevention strategies, highlighting the public policy favoring nondisclosure in the interest of preventing criminal activities. The university is required to inform you that to the extent this amounts to a denial of your request it is subject to review by mandamus under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1)(a) or by application to the attorney general or district attorney pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.37(1)(b). The university has responded to your request and it is now closed. Sincerely, Julie Laundrie Public Records Custodian Office of Compliance University of Wisconsin-Madison   \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Access the Public Records Center to View the Request",

However, I wish to implore the Bureau to continue searching for records and respond accordingly.

Attached, please find reference to evidence and testimony from the trial of Keith Raniere in Eastern District of New York that there was an intrusion into Mr. Bronfman's electronic mail correspondence.

I would like to request the date and time that Ms. Valcorba had \"inspectional services\" to 27 Squire Lane to mark the curb in white paint to mark the property line. It would seem Ms. Valcorba has confabulated a story to paint the residents of 25 Squire Lane in a negative light.  Who holds on to a \"grudge\" from 2015 with a neighbor over a basketball net that even to present , they do not use.  They put up a basketball net on the neighbor's lawn, the neighbor questioned it, which led to Ms. Valcorba contacting the previous home owner regarding the property line, YET after 60 years the Houde's are 100% sure of where the line is. Ms Valcorba needs some help\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nGERALDINE HOUDE\r\n                ",

The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

The number of Application for Transportation Service requests, aka \"White Forms\", submitted; \r\n2. The number of students who have accepted transportation reimbursement stipends; \r\n3. Special Education Students Missing Active Transportation Request - anonymized aggregated students including type of transportation. RESPONSE: Documents responsive to parts one (1) and two (2) of your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests. Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\nPart three (3) of this request fails to cite an existing record for review. Note that the district does not maintain data reflecting counts of \u201cSpecial Education Students Missing Active Transporting Request\u201d in the same record or database as data reflecting \u201ctype of transportation\u201d. In order to respond to that portion of the request, the district would be required to pull data from multiple sources maintained by different departments, conduct original research and analysis to join to the two datasets, and then manually combine them in order to create a new record, not maintained in the normal course of business and outside the scope of the FOIA. \r\nThe requirements of the FOIA apply to public records \u201chaving been prepared by or for, or having been or being used by, received by, or in the possession of, or under the control of any public body.\u201d [5 ILCS 140/2(c)]. Accordingly, and as determined in Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989), the FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. \r\nAdditionally, a FOIA request must reasonably identify a record(s) for review and not \u201ca general request for data, information and statistics to be gleaned generally from documents which have not been created and which the agency does not generally create or require.\u201d [ Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28,32 (4 th Dist. 1989)]. Additionally, \u201cA requester is entitled only to records that an agency has in fact chosen to create and retain.\u201d [ Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1922)] Additionally, Section 1\u00a0of the\u00a0FOIA states in part: \"This Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part\u00a0of\u00a0any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\"\u00a0In accordance with Section 1\u00a0of\u00a0Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer questions in response to a specific query [5 ILCS 140/1]. Personally identifiable student record information is exempt from release in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. If you have any questions, please contact our office at (773) 553-3500. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Ana Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",

However, we may be able to provide some of what you're looking for in terms of aggregate numbers of requests and requests status.

In the terms you're searching for, I can give you a log of all our FOIA requests dating back to when CDPH started using the GovQA platform to track them, which dates back around 3 years to mid-2021. These logs will give you open and close dates for each request as well as request status. For requests dating back before that time, I have records of open and close dates but I do not have an updated log of status for each request. I'm happy to provide the log from 2021-present if that will be sufficient. Let me know what you think.\r\nThanks, \r\nJacob Martin \r\nChicago Department of Public Health",
