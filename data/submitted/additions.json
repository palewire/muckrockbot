        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nI am writing to request information regarding the annual expenditure on Compensation and Pension (C&P) examinations performed by contract agencies that are ultimately deemed inadequate for rating purposes. As a concerned citizen, I believe it is essential to understand the financial impact of these insufficient examinations on the VA's budget and the potential resources that could be better allocated to serve our veterans effectively.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am requesting the following information:\r\n\r\nThe total annual cost of C&P examinations conducted by contract agencies on behalf of the VA.\r\nThe number of C&P examinations performed by contract agencies each year.\r\nThe percentage and number of C&P examinations performed by contract agencies that are found to be inadequate for rating purposes annually.\r\nThe estimated total cost of C&P examinations performed by contract agencies that are deemed inadequate for rating purposes each year.\r\nThis information will help shed light on the scale of the issue and the financial implications of inadequate C&P examinations performed by contract agencies. It will also assist in identifying potential areas for improvement in the examination process and contract oversight, ensuring that our veterans receive the proper evaluations they deserve while maximizing the efficient use of the VA's resources.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the requested information for the most recent fiscal year available. If possible, I would also appreciate data from the past three to five fiscal years to identify any trends or patterns in the annual costs associated with inadequate C&P examinations performed by contract agencies.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter and for your commitment to serving our nation's veterans. I look forward to your timely response.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGary",
