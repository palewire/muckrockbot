Reporting can be done through our online reporting portal or by downloading, completing and then submitting FDA Form 3500 (Health Professional) or 3500B (Consumer/Patient) to MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program. I am looking for:\r\n- The current database schema, data dictionary, or other reference document(s) to show how the FDA tracks these reports.\r\n - A database export or disaggregated data of reports submitted to this system since 2020.  If possible please include accompanying documentation submitted by the complainant. Please include the relevant fields releasable under the law. \r\n\r\nAs required under FOIA, I request that the agency provide the above records in their native digital format, where applicable (such as a CSV, Excel, or other digital data format), and transferred to me electronically. If you deny this request in whole or in part, I request that you respond with the statutory exemption underlying the denial and the reasoning therein. If an asserted exemption applies to only a portion of a record, please delete or redact the portion to which the exemption applies and provide the remainder of the record, as required under the FOIA. \r\n\r\nAs a reporter for the WIRED, I qualify as a news media requester for the purpose of fees. See 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(ii). Further, because this request is being made for a journalistic purpose regarding a matter of public interest, I further ask that you waive any fees. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii).\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

The records you seek require a search in at least one other office within ATF, and so your request presents \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d under the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(iii)(I).  Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute.  We have not completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request.  The time needed to process your request will depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located. For your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:  simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  At this time, your request has been assigned to the Complex track.  Your request has been placed in chronological order based on the date of receipt and will be handled as quickly as possible when it is assigned for processing.  A tracking number has been assigned to your request and is set forth above.  Please refer to this number in any future communications regarding this request.Because this Office is not assessing any fees in connection with the processing of your request, there is no need for us to determine whether your request qualifies for a waiver of fees.If you have any questions regarding the status of your request, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at 202-648-7390 to discuss any aspect of your request.   Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.

This significant demand has caused a backlog of FOIA requests, and is considered an \u201cunusual circumstance.\u201d  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).  Because of these unusual circumstances, we need to extend the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by statute. \r\n\r\nDue to this backlog, we estimate that it will take 90 days from the date of this letter to respond to your request.  Please note this is only an estimated date of completion as there may be circumstances that lead to a longer or shorter processing time.  The time needed to complete our processing of your request will necessarily depend on the complexity of our records search and on the volume and complexity of any records located.  In any event, we will follow up with you if we are able to locate potentially responsive documents from the appropriate ATF component.  To allow us to respond more quickly to you, you may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing. \r\n\r\nI regret the necessity of this delay, but I assure you that your request will be processed as soon as possible.  If you have any questions or wish to discuss reformulation or an alternative time frame for the processing of your request, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390, for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nElizabeth A.

Please refer to this number in any future correspondence. \n\nIn response to your request, we are releasing a total of 30 pages of responsive material.  Individual redactions identify the exemption pursuant to which the redacted material has been withheld.  Please be advised that we considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing records and applying FOIA exemptions. \n\nPursuant to exemption (b)(6), 0 pages have been withheld in full and 3 pages in part. We are withholding third party information, including the names of ATF employees, under FOIA Exemption (b)(6).  To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the persons whose information you requested.  Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.  The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). \n\nPursuant to exemption (b)(6), (b)(7)(C), 0 pages have been withheld in full and 27 pages in part.  We are withholding third party information, including the names of ATF employees.  To disclose personal information about a living individual to a member of the public, we need the written consent from the persons whose information you requested.  Without written consent, proof of death, or an overriding public interest, personal information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.  The FOIA does not require agencies to disclose information that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6).  Also, we are withholding third party information, including the names of ATF employees as well as personal information of other persons mentioned in the records, pursuant to Exemption (b)(7)(C) of the FOIA. Exemption (b)(7)(C) permits the withholding of information compiled for law enforcement purposes that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d The public interest in disclosure is limited to the FOIA\u2019s core purpose of shedding light on an agency\u2019s performance of its statutory duties. The public interest under Exemption (b)(7)(C) must be both significant and compelling in order to overcome the legitimate personal privacy interests of a third party. In this matter, the disclosure would not serve the core purpose of the FOIA but would serve as an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C). \n\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA.  This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \n\nYou may contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390 for  any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request.  Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.  The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, Room 2510, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769. \n\nIf you are not satisfied with my response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIA STAR portal by creating an account following the instructions on OIP\u2019s website: https://doj-foia.entellitrak.com/etk-doj-foia-prod/login.request.do.

        "communication": "Dear U.S. Mint:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act. I am requesting records related to the U.S. Mint's mascot, Layla the Mighty Minter.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED:\r\n\r\n(A) All records related to the conception of and process of designing the Layla mascot (emails and other correspondence, memoranda, contracts, sketches, etc.)\r\n\r\n(B) Records sufficient to answer the following questions:\r\n\r\n(1) Whose idea was it to create an U.S. Mint mascot in the first place, and why?\r\n\r\n(2) Who designed the Layla mascot, and what was the design process like? (e.g. were there multiple design concepts submitted? Was the design of the character contracted out? (If so, kindly produce the contract).\r\n\r\n(3) Were any Layla-related promotional items or tchotchkes created (e.g. trading cards, CDs, coloring books)? If so, please produce them.\r\n\r\n(4) Were there any life-size Layla costumes created? If so, please produce records related to the design of the costume (contracts, sketches, etc.) and any guidelines regarding the use of or care for the costume.\r\n\r\n(5) Did anyone in Congress ever object to the U.S. Mint's use of a mascot? I understand that there have been periodic attempts by lawmakers (e.g. former Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn, current Iowa senator Jodi Ernst) to rein in agency spending on mascots. If so, please produce all records related to that.\r\n\r\n(6) What has the public's reaction been to the Layla mascot?\r\n\r\n(7) Is the Mint still using Layla as part of its public outreach? If not, why not?\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER:\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public online for free, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. I am working on a project examining the history, creation, evolution, and use of mascots across the federal government\u2014because, like many others, I find them fascinating and weirdly delightful. Thus, I respectfully request that any fees related to this request be waived. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you expect those fees to exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nI would prefer that this request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your cooperation with this request. I look forward to hearing from you soon!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern: \r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools. \r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and, \r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b). \r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request. \r\nSincerely, \r\nMakayla Connor\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration \r\nConnor.mak@northeastern.edu\r\n(508) 340-1740\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMakayla Connor",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for public records under the California Public Records Act (CPRA).\r\n\r\nUnder SB 978, a law passed in 2018, \"each local law enforcement agency shall conspicuously post on their Internet Web sites all current standards, policies, practices, operating procedures, and education and training materials that would otherwise be available to the public if a request was made pursuant to the California Public Records Act.\"\r\n\r\nPursuant to CPRA, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n\u2022 All current standards, policies, practices, operating procedures, and education and training materials in use by this agency.\r\n\r\nIf these records are already available online, please provide me with the direct links to them. Otherwise, I would prefer these records in an electronic format.\r\n\r\nIf there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $10. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of police practices. As the Senate Rules Committee wrote in its May 26, 2018 floor analysis:\r\n\r\n\"Making regulations of law enforcement agencies easily accessible to the public helps educate the public about law enforcement policies, practices, and procedures, increases communication and community trust, and enhances transparency while saving costs and labor associated with responding to individual requests for this information.\"\r\n\r\nThis information is not being sought for commercial purposes. Furthermore, the requested materials are required by law to be made easily available due to their importance to the public.\r\n\r\nThe California Public Records Act requires a response within 10 business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nI can be reached via email at the address attached to this request.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

I am requesting copies of public records regarding health and behavioural health service delivery in youth correctional facilities in your jurisdiction, to inform a comparative research project regarding health and mental health care delivery in juvenile detention facilities across the US. Specifically, I request information regarding the following:\r\n1. Name and contact details for those responsible for health and behavioural health services provisions at all locations where juveniles are incarcerated within your jurisdiction.\r\n2. Regulations, policies and procedures that govern the operation of health and behavioral health provision for juveniles incarcerated within your jurisdiction. This includes health intake, room confinement, medication management,  access to specialist and dental services, discharge planning services, and other health and behavioral health related policies.\r\n3. Contracts from January 1, 2021 to the time the request is filled between your agency and any healthcare provider including both physical health and behavioral health. \r\n4. Records concerning your jurisdiction\u2019s most recent application to Centre for Medicaid Services (CMS) for an 1115 Medicaid waiver (if applicable), and any response, with specifically focus on how and whether such a waiver applies to provision of Medicaid funded services for detained juveniles.\r\n5. Records relating to financing for health and behavioural health care delivery in your jurisdiction. \r\n\r\nI request the records be provided electronically. If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding of the administration of juvenile justice. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf access to the records I am requesting will take longer than allowed by statute, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies of the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTess Kelly \r\nFellow, Harvard FXB Centre for Health and Human Rights \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice\r\n617.338.1050",

Inspector Tony Robles noted that on May 9, 2024, he went to the Baltimore and spoke with the complaining tenant, and took photos.  Please provide all of those notes, documents, photos or videos.\r\n3. All communications regarding the February 2022 inspection by Tony Robles of the Baltimore, during which he noted over 100 violations for lack of deadbolts, but James Heiberg said to delete those violations. \r\n4. All communications between anyone from Code Enforcement and anyone at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, regarding the deadbolts at the Baltimore.  This is including but not limited to the text messages and emails that Robert Gilardi kindly sends to Mark Dyer rather than issuing a Notice to Comply. This includes communications between Code Enforcement on the one hand, and on the other hand,  AHF's: Mark Dyer, Michael Weinstein, Jonathan Eisenberg, Tom Myers, Conrad Sison, Beatrice Di Marco, Dominique Eastman, Herbert Ellis,  Juan Larios.\r\n5. Any discussion (including emails, text messages, memos, notes) between any Code Enforcement employee, (including but not limited to James Heiberg, Robert Gilardi, Tony Robles, Ann Sewill, etc.), that includes any of the following terms: \"1941.3\" \"deadbolt\" \"dead bolt\" \"91.8607\" \"door lock\" \"91.8607\" and/or \"897099.\" \r\n6. Any discussion between any Code Enforcement employee, about why it decided to exclude the exact complaint language from the publicly accessible Property Activity Report on complaint #897099.\r\n7. Any emails with the subject line \"Complaint # 897099 / Baltimore Hotel / Carlos Brum/ Lack of Deadbolts\"\r\n\r\nThis public records act request is not limited to the custodian of records simply forwarding this request to the named individuals here. This request demands that the custodian of records actually contact its IT department and conduct a search with the specific parameters and search terms. This request demands electronic copies of these records in their native format, and not printed out and scanned.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnnette Morasch",

The letter you received was a good faith estimate of the time it will take to fulfill your sunshine request as required by section 610.023.3 of Missouri\u2019s Sunshine Law.  As explained in the letter, the estimate takes into account, among other things, the sheer volume of requests received by our office. We process sunshine requests as quickly as possible in the order they are received. Because we process the requests in the order they are received, whether you amend your request, which you are welcome to do, or keep it as is, it does not change its position in the queue. As our previous letter stated, there are currently 288 open sunshine requests, many of which require the review of hundreds of thousands of pages. In addition, we receive numerous emails and additional requests each day. Your request is important to us and will be processed as soon as it reaches the front of the line. We are reviewing and releasing records as quickly as possible, and we appreciate your continued patience.\nBest,\r\nNicki\r\n\r\nNicki Eatinger-Sprague | Custodian of Records\r\nMissouri Attorney General's Office",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 230 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 1,085 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,310 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days  .\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

The Morgan County CORA Request policy states that the first hour is free and then each additional hour is $33.58. We would ask for a deposit of half to initiate the appropriate work.

I forgot to mention that if the number of hours is less than anticipated, you will not be charged and/or refunded.\r\n\r\nI have attached the normal CORA form for your information of our policies.

You case was also\r\nassigned FOIAonline tracking number NARA-NGC-2017-000583, we currently\r\ntrack cases using two different databases.\r\n\r\nYour case is complex and for many of our complex cases that take more than\r\n20\r\ndays to process, responsive documents have been sent out to other federal\r\nagencies for consultation.\r\n\r\nAs we await a response, we are able to process cases lower in our queue that\r\nare not awaiting outside consultation. We have identified and gathered\r\nall the responsive documents for your case and expect your case could be\r\none of those we can complete ahead of cases awaiting consultations.\r\n\r\nWe expect to process your case within the next 3 to 6 months, we apologize\r\nfor the delay.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nWanda Williams\r\nDeputy Freedom of Information Act Officer/Archivist\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\nOffice of General Counsel\r\nCollege Park, Maryland\r\n301-837-0773",

Planning and\r\nZoning is aware of the request so they should hopefully be able to find the\r\ndocuments ASAP. Thank you for your patience. For convenience and tracking\r\nof both requests, I will respond to both of them with this message. Have a\r\ngreat day.\r\n\r\nKevin Strauch",

        "communication": "Dear Jason,\r\n\r\nI work in the Press Office at the Department of Buildings, and I was forwarded your FOIL request by a member of the Department who manages FOIL requests.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of expediency, wanted to share some information on the Department's recent enforcement actions at the St. Vitus Bar. See below:\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   On 2/16/24, DOB conducted an inspection of 1120 Manhattan Avenue, Brooklyn, in response to over a dozen 311 complaints from members of the public about the location.\r\n  *   Upon our arrival to the scene, we found approximately 250 people on the first floor of the building, assembled in an illegal eating and drink establishment.\r\n  *   The Certificate of Occupancy for the building indicates that the first floor of this building is supposed be used for a commercial store and for the storage of machinery.\r\n  *   As a result of our inspection we issued a violation to the property owner for operating the unpermitted place of assembly, contrary to the legal occupancy of the building.\r\n  *   During our inspection, DOB did not issue a Vacate Order at the building. The building can still be occupied.\r\n  *   This is the second time we have issued a violation to 1120 Manhattan Avenue for this issue. We previously issued a similar violation to the property owner on 7/21/23.\r\n  *   That July 2023 violation remains unresolved, as the property owners never corrected the issue. That is why they were issued another violation by DOB on February 16th.\r\n  *   If the property owner wishes to legally operate the club, they can obtain permits to legally convert the space and obtain a new Certificate of Occupancy from DOB.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the above and for other information you may be seeking on this matter, you can use the Department's Building Information System (BIS) which is publicly available.\r\n\r\nIf you visit BIS and type the address of St Vitus Bar (1120 Manhattan Ave, Brooklyn) you will be directed to this page: https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/PropertyProfileOverviewServlet?boro=3&houseno=1120&street=Manhattan+Ave&go2=+GO+&requestid=0\r\n\r\nFrom there, you can view all 311 complaints: https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/ComplaintsByAddressServlet?requestid=1&allbin=3063704\r\n\r\nAs well as DOB violations: https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/ActionsByLocationServlet?requestid=1&allbin=3063704&allinquirytype=BXS4OCV3&stypeocv3=V\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if the information provided here is sufficient to fulfill your FOIL request. If it is, we will close out the request. If you would like to leave it open and move forward with the FOIL request, please let us know in your response.\r\nBest,\r\nDavid Maggiotto\r\nDeputy Press Secretary\r\nNYC Department of Buildings\r\n(929) 512-0051",

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publish a\r\n    number of . . . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdocument sets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00c2\u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Samuel Loring Morison.\r\n    \r\n    The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and\r\n    this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n    \r\n    In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me\r\n    of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

The documents were received by ATF on April 3, 2024, and this referral was assigned ATF tracking number 2024-01020.  Please refer to this number in any future correspondence with this office.  For your reference, the FBI file number associated with this request is FBI FOI/PA # 1590533-000. \n\nFor your information, this office assigns incoming requests to one of three tracks:  simple, complex, or expedited.  Each request is then handled on a first-in, first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track.  Simple requests usually receive a response in approximately one month, whereas complex requests necessarily take longer.  At this time, your request has been assigned to the Simple track.  You may wish to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive records or agree to an alternative time frame for processing, should records be located; or you may wish to await the completion of our records search to discuss either of these options. \n\nWe determined that you are a representative of the news media pursuant to 5 U.S.C. section  552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).  As such, we are required to assess fees for duplication of responsive records.  See 28 C.F.R. section 16.10(c).  You may review the Department of Justice regulations, which establish the fees charged for processing FOIA requests at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-2015-04-03/2015-07772.  If you disagree with this determination, you are welcome to provide any additional information that would demonstrate that you should not be considered a representative of the news media requester.  If you would like to discuss either the track or the fees associated with your request, please contact our FOIA Public Liaisons, Lynette Carter and Jasmine Bryant, at 202-648-7390.  You may also discuss any aspect of your request with our FOIA Public Liaison. \n\nSincerely, \n\nElizabeth A. Wood \nActing Chief \nInformation and Privacy Governance Division\n",
