Please redact FOIA-exempt PII in the records provided.\r\n\r\nI am seeking to understand how this email address was added to DHS's \"address book\" and how it lead to CBP/DHS inadvertently leaking sensitive PII to a state government email address with less exemptions than FOIA. I am making this request in the public interest to understand how CBP/DHS policy led to this issue, how CBP/DHS responded, any lessons CBP/DHS learned, and how Americans may protect themselves.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKarl Koscher",
