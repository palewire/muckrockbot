The death was profiled in a BuzzFeed article titled: \"The Strange Case of the Russian Diplomat Who Got His Head Smashed In On Election Day.\" News coverage implied that the circumstances around this individual and the death were more mysterious than the Russian government claimed and that it resembled other deaths of Russian individuals in the same time frame. \r\n\r\nThe election day 2016 death of Sergei Kirvov received limited and measured news coverage from mainstream news sources. It additionally spread in a more conspiratorial manner on social media in the weeks after the 2016 election. Most of the news coverage of the death was in the months following election day. Please limit the search, naturally, to between November 8th 2016 and January 20th of 2017. \r\n\r\nSearch terms:\r\n\"Sergei Kirvov\"\r\n\"Sergey Kirvov\"\r\n\"Cergej Kirvov\"\r\n\"Russian consular employee death\"\r\n\r\nIf there is not NSC Correspondence about this death or news coverage or social media chatter about the death, then publicly say so and close the request. \r\n\r\nNews coverage for context: \r\nhttps://nypost.com/2016/11/08/dead-man-with-head-trauma-found-at-russian-consulate/\r\nhttps://zakonbase.ru/content/part/293588\r\nhttps://www.rferl.org/a/russian-embassy-guard-found-dead-new-york-no-foul-play-suspected/28105096.html\r\n\r\nThank you for the Obama Presidential library for the commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
