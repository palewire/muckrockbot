Mr. Payne states that as part of the program, he was assigned an informant number LA 7852-S (Extremist), and asked to work in an undercover capacity to infiltrate the Weather Underground, an organization identified by the bureau as a domestic terrorist group made up of members of the New Left.\r\n\r\nMr. Payne\u2019s FBI file was released by the bureau as part of Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) request 1581024-000, and contained therein, Mr. Payne references SPECTAR in a letter dated December 17, 1977, which identifies four separate FOIPA requests sent by Mr. Payne to the bureau. Mr. Payne writes: \r\n\r\n\u201cBy letter dated August 25, 1977, you acknowledged receipt of my requests and advised that a notarized affidavit of signature would be required before documents pertaining to me would be released.  You further advised that requests for personal records had been assigned 51,331, the SPECTAR request number 51,340, and and my \u2018final request\u2019 number 51,330.\u201d\r\n\r\nSPECTAR also appears in records related to the FBI\u2019s Domestic Intelligence Division released to researcher Ernie Lazar and now publicly accessible via the Internet Archive, in files labeled \u201cFBI Domestic Intelligence Division HQ 4\u201d, \u201cFBI Domestic Intelligence Division HQ 5\u201d, and \u201cFBI Domestic Intelligence Division HQ 6\u201d. SPECTAR is referenced in a bureau report in \u201cFBI Domestic Intelligence Division HQ 4\u201d:\r\n\r\n\u201cBy airtel dated 7/12/72 captioned \u2018Revolutionary Activities - Violence\u2019 a program was initiated to focus on Special Targets for Informant Development (SPECTAR Program). This informant program has as its aim the development of informants who have the capability of penetrating the revolutionary underground, which has been notable for its security consciousness. We have instructed appropriate field offices to assign manpower to SPECTAR and to reduce case load to the degree that these Agents can concentrate on SPECTAR and still maintain close association with developments in pertinent investigations.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor reference, mentions of SPECTAR can be found in the following report: https://archive.org/details/foia_FBI_Domestic_Intelligence_Division-HQ-4/page/n13/mode/1up\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Payne has published written material naming the SPECTAR program, and the bureau acknowledged the existence of such a program in its own internal documents, it is clear the bureau generated records in the course of operations of this program. Therefore, I am asking the bureau to release all records pertaining to SPECTAR.\r\n\r\nRelease of this information is in the public interest because it is related to surveillance operations targeting Americans. Although the bureau classified the Weather Underground Organization as a terrorist group, there is an ongoing dialogue in academia as to whether or not it was a legitimate protest group and how much of its violence was centrally-directed. Arthur Eckstein\u2019s 2016 non-fiction book \u201cBad Moon Rising: How the Weather Underground Beat the FBI and Lost the Revolution\u201d, for example, suggests that despite members of the group downplaying their acts of domestic terrorism once arrested, the bureau may have  had some role in encouraging violent acts.\r\n\r\nSPECTAR is relevant to this discussion because according to Mr. Payne in \u201cDeep Cover\u201d (chapter 8, pages 141 and 142):\r\n\r\n\u201cThe changes in Bureau procedures were not confined solely to the new undercover program. With the approval of Acting Director Pay Gray, a companion program was formulated by the Domestic Intelligence Division under the code name of SPECTAR. The Special Target Informant Development Program (SPECTAR) was designed to improve the efficiency of the deep cover agent and to provide more immediate avenues of penetrating Weathermen support groups. Repeated efforts by the Bureau to develop reliable informants among close friends and associates of the Weathermen fugitives had proved fruitless. It was reasoned that this failure was due in large part to the traditional method of payment for Bureau informants.\u201d \r\n\r\nThus, any records the bureau might have on SPECTAR would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government.\r\n\r\nTied to that, I am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

I request that a copy of the following documents [or documents containing the following information] be provided to Targeted Justice, Inc.:\r\n1) All the reports by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts on Applications for Delayed-Notice Search Warrants and Extensions drafted and/or published pursuant to the USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, documenting the number of applications for warrants and extensions of warrants authorizing delayed notice granted or denied during the each  fiscal year since 2005.\r\nThe term \u201cdocument\u201d is to be liberally construed to include any file, paper, microfilm, digital archive, or any other format where the information sought may be stored.\r\nAs you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure, and also requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(8).\r\nTargeted Justice's status as a news organization that provides information of public interest to its members warrants the expedited processing of this Request on the grounds that there is a compelling need for these records because the information requested is urgently needed by an organization primarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2); 28 C.F.R. \u00a716.5(d)(1)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nRequest for expedited processing Targeted Justice currently has over 15,000 subscribers in its Substack newsletter. Thus, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.466 it is a news media organization.\r\nTargeted Justice also requests the expedited processing of this request on the grounds that the records and documents requested relate to a \u201cbreaking news story of general public interest\u201d. Furthermore, they present a \u201cmatter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government\u2019s integrity which affect public confidence\u201d. Expedited processing is warranted when \u201cthe information is relevant to a subject of public urgency concerning an actual or alleged Federal government activity\u201d See 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.12(b)(2)(i); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.4(d)(3)(ii)(A); see also 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.5(d)(1)(iv); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.34(c)(2).\r\nIn light of the above, Targeted Justice requests that your agency adheres to the legal mandate contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.6(b), (c) and consequently produce within 20 days of receipt of this request the information sought.\r\nRequest for Fee Waiver\r\nTargeted Justice hereby requests a fee waiver of search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that the request does not respond to any \u201ccommercial interest of the requester.\u201d See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 22 C.F.R. \u00a7171.17(a); 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.11(k); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 286.28(d); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1900.13(b)(2).\r\nFurthermore, a waiver of search and review fees is warranted inasmuch as Targeted Justice will report the results of this endeavor on the grounds that Targeted Justice qualifies as a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d and that the records are not sought for commercial use. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii))(7); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1900.02(h)(3), 1900.13(i)(2).\r\nFor any document you fail to produce, Targeted Justice requests that you provide a Vaughn Index and declaration setting forth reasonably detailed explanations for each withheld document as to why it falls within any statutory exemption. See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Vaughn statement must specify details about each document's sender, recipients, date and time, and subject. If you need to discuss this request, the undersigned can be reached at 832-247-3046. Thank you for your consideration of my request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

So first off, Diana's desk phone records will need to be furnished as I have confirmed with AT&T that they maintain records far beyond this date. Secondly, it is irrelevant if Diana has a firstnet phone, a subsidized personal phone or an unsubsidized cell phone. The records will need to be retrieved from her cell phone and/or the carrier. If it is a personal phone then while she is \"on the clock\" or \"working\" any actions or information created on her personal phone (i.e. call records, texts etc.) also creates public records and would need to be retrieved and furnished. This has been upheld by courts across the nation and please consult the town attorney regarding this matter if needed. Now that you are aware of how your phone systems work and operate. Any hesitation to turn over these phone records is no longer negligence.\r\n\r\nThere should not be any fees associated pertaining to this request, I would prefer the request be filled electronically, by e-mail attachment and/or download link as per Sunshine Law.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nMason C. Turner",
