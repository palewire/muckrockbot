Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action. \r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force. \r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes: \r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm]. \r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

You requested the following records: I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021. On behalf of the District and the Records Department, I want to apologize for the delay in acknowledging your request and the delay in getting you your first installment of responsive records.\u00a0 As stated, the District received your request on Tuesday, December 13th. The students and most employees in the District began their winter break on the afternoon of Friday, December 16th. The District's administration building was open for business on the following week but was closed from December 26th until January 3 rd. Not to make excuses but the only thing I can figure is that your request got mixed in with others the District is currently working to answer for copies of public records requests the District received\u00a0in 2019 and 2020.\u00a0 Again I apologize\u00a0for the delay and confusion. The District understands that you do not wish the District to use the GovQA platform when answering your request.

You requested the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021.\r\n\r\nRichland School District has identified and located records responsive to your request.  An installment to your public records request is now available. The District understands that you do not wish the District to use the GovQA platform when answering your request. The District will be sending responsive records to the e-mail address provided but it will also be utilizing the GovQA platform so that it can track all of its records request related correspondence. Attached please find an installment of responsive records to your request. You can expect the next installment in the next three working days. As you may know, while the public records laws in Washington State are very broad and presume disclosure, they do not require a public agency to create a record to answer a request.  Therefore, if the District has records that answer your request, it will provide them to you as requested. Please log in to the Public Records Request Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nThe District acknowledges your request to \"provide all identified public records in their NATIVE format.\" Some information in identified public records require redaction. The District's redaction software requires all attachments to be in PDF format. Therefore, any document requiring redaction will be in PDF format, which may or may not be native format. All redactions will be listed on a redaction log. Also, some attachments not requiring redaction have been converted to PDF to reduce file size as you have requested the District to \"provide all records electronically via direct email attachment...\".\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to receive documents in native format, it will increase the Districts response time and could incur additional fees.\r\n\r\nPlease log in to the Public Records Request Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request - R000186-010623<https://rsdwa.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/RequestEdit.aspx?rid=344&coid=7BFE0C48206CDD>\r\n\r\nBeginning December 1, 2022 the District will be charging for all public records requests.  Please see our policy and procedures for our fee schedule https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820578  and  https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820577\r\n\r\nIf I have misunderstood your request in any way or you have any questions, please reply to this email.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKelsey Greenough\r\nLegal\r\n\r\n\r\nKelsey Greenough\r\nRecords Specialist",

Organizations wishing to participate in the mobility program must first submit request for certification packets to the agency with which they seek to partner. Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

Included is a copy of all assignment agreements, lists from both DOL and OPM providing names of approved organzations and the supporting documents provided to the Department of Labor by the organizations. The individual agreements have been redacted under FOIA Exemption 6 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6)), which protects information about individuals in  \"personnel and medical files and similar files\" when the disclosure of such information \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or difficulties with the attached documents. While we have been as responsive as possible to your request, if you feel we have responded in error, you may file an appeal with the Solicitor of Labor within 90 days from the date of this letter.  The appeal must state the grounds for the appeal and must include supporting statements, arguments, a copy of your initial request, and a copy of this letter.

This includes, but is not limited to, documents, reports, multimedia, body-worn camera footage, arrest filings, and so on. It also includes all documents, notes, correspondence and memoranda evidencing sustained findings reports and investigations, and all communication and correspondence in whatever tangible medium between the officials, the victims and the overseeing agency. \r\n\r\nI am requesting digital copies of all responsive documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nHere, misconduct includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\nExcessive (unreasonable) force \u2013 beatings, manhandling of people in handcuffs, improper use of Tasers, injuries inflicted by police dogs, improper use of deadly force, and other police brutality or disregard for the safety of suspects. It also includes, but is not limited to: physical and verbal abuse, restraints happening unreasonably, coerced or forced confessions, and sexual abuse and assault. \r\n\r\nFalse arrests \u2013 pulling over, detention, questioning and searches conducted without any probable cause whatsoever, including cases of planted evidence, racial profiling and trumped-up charges of resisting arrest.\r\n\r\nMisconduct investigations do not fall under records that are exempted by the law: \u201cpersonnel and medical files or information and any other materials or data relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; provided, however, that this subclause shall not apply to records related to a law enforcement misconduct investigation\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Public Records Act requires a response to this request within 10 days.  If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 415-769-8210 or ananyatiwarijournalism@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnanya Tiwari",

According to our conversation, it is my understanding that the only email records pertaining to Scott Gottlieb that were maintained by the FDA were emails to or from broad distribution lists. As I am concerned more with direct correspondence with Mr. Gottlieb's professional email address, you may exclude those broad distribution emails from this request. If there is a way for Information Management and Technology to retrieve deleted emails during that time frame, I would appreciate it for Mr. Gottlieb's email account.\r\n\r\nI am also aware that official correspondence that went through the Office of the Commissioner was archived starting in 2005. Please amend my request to include these records that were sent from or to or referenced Scott Gottlieb.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAlexander Rony\r\nSierra Club",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Marquis and Ms. Taylor,\r\n\r\nThank you for your May 9 acknowledgment letter of my FOIA request (number 2017-00731-FOIA-OS). In it, you stated, \"If your request seeks a waiver or reduction of the fees that we would customarily charge for furnishing agency records and your request does not contain sufficient information to enable us to determine whether a waiver or reduction of fees is warranted, you should provide such information to this office within 10 working days of receipt of this letter.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that you waive all fees in connection with this request as provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). The Sierra Club is a national environmental nonprofit with no commercial interest in obtaining the requested information. Instead, our organization intends to analyze and disseminate the requested information free of charge so that the public can be better informed and meaningfully participate in the proper oversight of food and drugs.\r\n\r\nThe subject matter of the requested records is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government by disclosing the views of the new head of the Food and Drug Administration on certain topics that are expected to come before the government.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Club and its supporters have demonstrated interest and expertise in the subject area, specifically the development of policies designed to safeguard public health, reduce the amount of toxic chemicals in food, and encourage a sustainable agricultural economy. Our supporters have filed hundreds of thousands of public comments to agencies related to these issues.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Club also has the ability and intention to disseminate the information it receives through this request. The information may be shared through emails to an audience of hundreds of thousands of people, Facebook and Twitter posts reaching thousands of individuals, articles on our website, and analysis provided to the media. \r\n\r\nIn addition to being granted a public interest fee waiver, I ask that I be properly categorized as a media use requester. My professional duties at the Sierra Club include composing mass communications to our followers, analyzing FOIA responses, and coordinating with press secretaries. Here are three such examples that resulted from my work:\r\n\r\nhttps://sierraclub.org/planet/2017/04/hiring-freeze-prevented-epa-filling-hundreds-jobs \r\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/04/13/politics/epa-hiring-freeze/index.html \r\nhttp://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/press-releases/4480/over-700000-people-tell-government-to-block-seed-mergers \r\n\r\nI hope this is enough information for you to grant me a public interest fee waiver and media requester status, but please let me know if you need more details.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlexander Rony\r\nSierra Club",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n01/30/2023 \r\nKayla Henson (Open Records No. H000184-012323), \r\n\r\nWe have received your public information request for H000184-012323, dated 01/23/2023. The information you requested has some components redacted because disclosure would provide competitors an advantage per Tex. Govt. Code \u00a7552.104(a) and the documents consist of \u201ccommercial information\u201d and \u201cfinancial information\u201d which, if disclosed, would cause substantial competitive harm per \u00a7552.110(b). The relevant exceptions from the Attorney General\u2019s Public Information Handbook and the Texas Public information Act are stated below: Tex. Govt. Code \u00a7552.104: Information Relating to Competition or Bidding:\u00a0 Section 552.104 of the Government Code provides as follows: (a) Information is excepted from the requirements of Section 552.021 if it is information that, if released, would give advantage to a competitor or bidder (b) The requirement of Section 552.022 that a category of information listed under Section 552.022(a) is public information and not excepted from required disclosure under this chapter unless expressly confidential under law does not apply to information that is excepted from required disclosure under this section. Section 552.104(a) of the Government Code excepts from disclosure information that, if released, would give advantage to a competitor or bidder. The Texas Supreme Court considered section 552.104 and held the \u201ctest under section 552.104 is whether knowing another bidder\u2019s [or competitor\u2019s information] would be an advantage, not whether it would be a decisive advantage.\u201d408 The supreme court further held section 552.104 protection is not limited to governmental bodies, and therefore a private third party may also invoke this exception.409 The supreme court\u2019s decision overrules a long line of attorney general decisions limiting the application of section 552.104 to governmental bodies and discussing the burden a governmental body must meet in order to withhold information under section 552.104. Both governmental bodies and third parties should therefore exercise caution in relying on prior attorney general decisions regarding the applicability of section 552.104. Section 552.104(b) provides that information excepted from disclosure under this section may be withheld even if it falls within one of the categories of information listed in Section 552.022(a). Tex. Govt. Code \u00a7 552.110(b): Exception; Confidentiality of Trade Secrets; Confidentiality of Certain Commercial and Financial Information Section 552.110 states: (b)Commercial or financial information for which it is demonstrated based on specific factual evidence that disclosure would cause substantial competitive harm to the person from whom the information was obtained is excepted from the requirements of Section 552.021. Section 552.110 now expressly includes the standard for excepting from disclosure commercial and financial information.577 An interested person must demonstrate \u201cbased on specific factual evidence that disclosure would cause substantial competitive harm to the person from whom the information was obtained.\u201d This standard resembles part of the test for applying the correlative exemption in the federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4), as set out in Nat\u2019l Parks & Conservation Ass\u2019n v. Morton. 578 That part of the National Parks test states that commercial or financial information is confidential if disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.579 The current commercial and financial information branch of section 552.110 does not incorporate the part of the National Parks test for information that is likely to impair the government\u2019s ability to obtain necessary information in the future. Like the federal standard, section 552.110(b) requires the business enterprise whose information is at issue to make a specific factual or evidentiary showing, not conclusory or generalized allegations, that substantial competitive injury would likely result from disclosure.580 The hyperlink for the portal is: https://www.tarleton.edu/compliance/open-records/  From the link above, click on \u201cthe Open Records Portal\u201d and then select \u201cMy Request Center\u201d to access this open records request using the assigned reference number above .

With racial equity as a central component of safety and security planning, it is imperative that all school safety and security staff not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.\"\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.\tProvide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3.\tProvide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nNote: If your agency chooses not to produce the requested records in reverse chronological order as requested, and/or chooses to sandbag this request by dribbling out a few records per installment every 6 months (tee-hee), you can expect a separate targeted public records request for each line item by year - submitted via multiple members of the public, multiple times until the requested records are timely produced. This simple three part multi year request would then become twelve (12) separate public records requests. If your agency would prefer 12 separate individual requests, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Your request was sent from the e-mail address 120953-42737343@requests.muckrock.com.  Your request sought the following records:\r\n\r\n\u2026all Public Records Requests received by Richland School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 8th and 9th, the District sent you two requests for clarification.  Then on November 15, the District e-mailed you.  The body of the District\u2019s e-mail is as follows:\r\n\r\nThis District has assigned your request with the number 1142021MR for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when corresponding about this request.\r\n\r\nSince receiving your request, I have sent at least two requests for clarification to your group and have not heard back.  I corresponded using the portal specific to the Richland School District and assigned by your group. I have not heard back from you.\r\n\r\nI am seeking clarification of your very large records request so that the District can provide you with an adequate response.  Is there a staff member that I can speak to for this clarification?  Understanding that you are on the other side of the country, is there a good day and time for me to call?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso on November 15th, you provided an initial clarification.  That same day the District acknowledged your clarification.  The District\u2019s response is as follows:\r\n\r\nI understand your request to be for a complete electronic copy of all public records requests received by the Richland School District #400 including the District\u2019s responses for the years 2021-2021.\r\n\r\nWhat I need clarification on is are you requesting all correspondence not just the initial request and the District\u2019s response as there are time like this, that the District asks for clarification.  Further, there are requests that are abandoned.  By that I mean, the Requestor does not clarify or does not come to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, are you including requests for video in your request?  If so, the District will need to give third parties adequate notice of your request and the opportunity to seek an injunction.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to speak over the phone with the member from your team who is making this request so that we can use our time more efficiently in responding to your request.  Please feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou responded on November 16th by stating that your request was for copies of any public records requests received by the District and any responses to these requests by the District, including abandoned requests and requests for video. You also acknowledged the District\u2019s need to give third-party notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 22, the District informed you that it was in the process of compiling a list of individuals who the District would need to provide third-party notice to and their contact information.  The District notified you that it was beginning the process of reviewing the responsive records to determine if there were any other necessary redactions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on the complexity of your request, the need to provide third party notice, and the need to carefully review the records for redactions, the District informed you it estimated it would take fourteen months to fully respond to your request. The District informed you that it would be providing the responsive records to you in installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District also noted that it was in the process of updating its public records policy.  Part of that policy update related to fees associated with processing and answering records request. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStarting on November 23rd, the District began received a large number of phone calls and e-mails from the individuals who had received the third-party notices.  Most individuals were concerned with who had requested the information and how the records would be used.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a letter to you on December 1st the District asked that you complete a commercial purposes declaration.  This declaration clearly states that you are not seeking lists of employees and their disclosable information for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn December 6th, the District received notice from you that you were neither seeking records for commercial purposes nor were you requesting any production of responsive documents that required a commercial purposes declaration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District continued to receive considerable communications from third parties it had provided notice to regarding your request. Also, the District was reviewing the responsive records to make sure they included all necessary redactions and contained a redaction log.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District e-mailed you installments to your records request by e-mail on the following dates:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 2022\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, the District notified you that it was migrating to the GovQA platform to received, process and release all public records requests.  One of the many reasons for this migration is that the District can release responsive files that are significantly larger than what the District\u2019s e-mail system can accommodate.  This allows for records to be release quicker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, you notified the District that while the District was free to use the GovQA platform, you as a Requestor were under no obligation to use the platform. Further you started, \u201c\u2026 as such I respectfully refuse.\u201d  Further you wrote e-mailed the District:\r\n\r\nThe District is directed to provide the requested public records via email or direct no-password, no registration, internet file sharing link. If this is not possible, then responsive records my be provided via US MAIL.\r\n\r\nUS MAIL ADDRESS:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District e-mailed you the following response:\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has begun using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The downside to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou acknowledged the District\u2019s e-mail. You again said you would accept response records via US mail and again provided your mailing address in Sumerville, MA.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District provided you with the following correspondence:\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nRichland School District received a public information request from you on November 04, 2021 and it is being processed in accordance with Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThe District assigned your request with the reference number R000001-020722 for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when communicating about your request.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following records:\r\n\r\n\u201call public records requests received by the District from November 14, 2011 through November 14, 2021. This includes the initial request, all responsive records from the District, and any redaction logs. Further your request also includes abandoned requests and requests for video records. Excluding list of names seeming for commercial purposes\u201d\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has began using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.

Thank you for your attention.\r\n\r\nApril 1st, 2022 \u2013 the District mailed you a thumb drive that contained 240 files of responsive records.  It also contained a bill for $36.95. This was sent to your mailing address.  The address the District used was:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn May 4th the District communicated to you the following:\r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of November 04, 2021, Reference # R000001-020722.\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nWe have not received your payment on invoice number INV22-R000001-1 for Public Records requested by you on November 04, 2021 with Request Number R000001-020722.  \r\n\r\nPlease see attached or login to the Public Records Request Center to view details.\r\n\r\nYou can make a check or money order payable to: Richland School District and mail to:\r\n\r\nAttn: Nayomi Munguia\r\n6972 Keene Road\r\nWest Richland WA 99353\r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nGalt Pettett\r\nCertified Public Records Officer\r\nLegal\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2022, the District sent to you a thumb drive to replace the two that you reported that you had not received.  There was no charge or fee for this as the last two that we have sent to you, have not been received by your organization.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District is currently loading another installment of responsive record to a thumb drive and will mail it to you by the end of the week. The District will make sure this thumb drive is sent to your new address.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOver the past few days, the District has received several new requests from you.  On November 14, 2022, the District received the following public records request from you:\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2021. Note: this identifiable record should be an exact copy of the answers submitted to the JLARC Public Records Request Reporting System.\r\n\r\n2. Provide complete copies of any and all worksheets, drafts, estimates, notes, and emails related to the completion of your agency\u2019s final 2021 JLARC report and answers to the JLARC website questionnaire submitted for the year 2021.\r\n\r\n3.

The District has assigned this request the number R000176-111622. Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.    \r\n\r\nThen on November 15, 2022, the District received another records request from you.  In this request you sought:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2019 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSRIPTS in the year 2019 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nThe District has assigned this request the number R000175-111622.  Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.    \r\n\r\nToday, the District received the following request from you:\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.

The District has assigned it the number R000177-111622.  Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAgain, the District is currently working on providing you with all responsive records to your original request. Richland School District Policy 4040 \u2013 Public Records Request provides in part, \u201cWhen the same requester simultaneously submits multiple, separate requests or makes one or more additional requests when previous requests are open, the District may queue the requests in the order in which they were received. The District is not required to work on an additional request until the initial requests are completed and closed. Requesters are responsible for informing the Public Records Officer if they want to reprioritize the fulfillment of their requests.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTherefore the District will answer your requests in the order it received them. If you want to prioritize your requests, please do so and let the District know which request you want the District to work on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnless you reprioritize the records requests, the District will continue to provide you with all responsive records to request #R000001-020722.

I take great pride in providing excellent services to Requestors. I am in no way trying to frustrate you or not comply with the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, the Richland School District received a records request from an e-mail address containing \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  In that request, the Requestor sought several years of records requests and the District\u2019s response to those records request.  The District has been answering this original request by sending installments to the Boston address below.\r\n\r\nThen in November, your request and others were received by the District from an e-mail address with \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  Since these requests were all from \u201cmuckrock\u201d, the District presumed they were all from the same organization.\r\n\r\nAre there different employees of Muckrock making different requests?  Again, I truly want to provide you with the records you want and do not want to frustrate you, but maybe I don\u2019t understand the Muckrock organization.\r\n\r\nAny insight you can provide would be appreciated.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nGalt L.

        "communication": "Good Morning:\r\n\r\nThe Richland School District received your records request on November 16th.  The District acknowledged the request on November 17th.  At the time, the District believed your request to be from an organization named Muckrock.  As previously explained, the District had received several requests from Muckrock.  As such, the District was answering the requests in the order that they were received.  The District now understands that you are an individual making a public records request through the Muckrock platform.\r\n\r\nThe District apologizes for the mistake and is prioritizing your request.  You requested the following public records:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2. Provide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3. Provide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nI have asked the Student Services Department to provide me with the records that answer the first section of your request. I should have those records in the next ten working days.\r\n\r\nAs you may know, the Richland School District serves students in the cities of Richland and West Richland.  The District only has School Resource Officers (SRO) in the high schools located in the city of Richland.  I have attached the agreement between the District and Richland Police Department.  This contract has not been finalized. This is the current version of the Agreement.\r\n\r\nI am also attaching the agreement that has been in place since 2018.  The District will continue to search for any other records that answer this section of your request.\r\n\r\nI understand the third section of your request to be for the work contact information for all safety and security staff, school resource officers and any other employee whose primary job is to provide safety and security services at the District\u2019s school during the 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school years.\r\n\r\nTo answer this section of your request, I have already made contact with the District\u2019s Human Resources Department to obtain the list of all school security staff for the past three school years and their work locations.  I estimate I will have this information to you in the next ten working days.\r\n\r\nTo answer this section, the District has the same two SROs from the Richland Police Department for the past several years.  Officer Jason Crouch has been assigned to Richland High School for the past several years.  His work telephone number is 509-967-6561.  The school\u2019s address is 930 Long Avenue, Richland Washington 99352.  His work e-mail address is Jason Crouch RHSSecure@rsd.edu<mailto:RHSSecure@rsd.edu>.\r\n\r\nRick Kane is the SRO assigned to Hanford High School. Hanford High School\u2019s address is 450 Hanford Street, Richland Washington, 99354. His work telephone number is 509-967-6521. Officer Kane\u2019s work e-mail address is Rick Kane HHSSecure@rsd.edu<mailto:HHSSecure@rsd.edu>.\r\n\r\nThe District did have an SRO at Enterprise Middle School a number of years ago.  West Richland Office Nick Letourneau has not been assigned to the West Richland school for at least two years.  The District is researching the officer\u2019s date of departure.\r\n\r\nAgain, the District apologizes for the mistake and the delay in getting the responsive records to you. We are prioritizing your request and will be providing you with installments of responsive records.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I misunderstood your request in any way or if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGalt L.

        "communication": "Dear Records Requestor:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mead School District received your public records request on November\r\n9, 2021. This serves as the District\u2019s response within five (5) business\r\ndays, as required by law.  You have requested:\r\n\r\n\r\n*\"I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests\r\nreceived by Mead School District and a complete electronic copy of the\r\nDistrict's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period\r\nJanuary 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\nYour records request seems clear in one respect, as to the records you wish\r\nto have copied and provided to you by the initial segment of your request.\r\nBut, the second segment of your request is not clear to us.  So, we are in\r\nneed of clarification from you as to that segment.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is clear by the first segment of your request that you wish to\r\nreceive a copy of every public records request that has been submitted to\r\nour School District, going back historically for more than a decade, to\r\nJanuary 1, 2010.\r\n\r\nIt will be a daunting and time-consuming task to locate all of those\r\nrecords for duplication and production to you.  Some of those requests\r\nwould have been received by us in electronic format only, e.g., such as via\r\nemail.  Those would not have been forwarded to any central electronic file\r\nlocation, nor printed to a paper copy and placed in any particular physical\r\nfile location.  As well, requests of that sort would not necessarily have\r\nbeen received by the person designated as our public records officer at the\r\ntime the request was received.  Rather, any given request could conceivably\r\nbeen received by any other given employee in our District.\r\n\r\nFor additional reasons, designing a search methodology calculated to locate\r\nall such emailed requests would be very difficult, if not impossible.  That\r\nis because we cannot be required to read every single email received by\r\nevery employee in our School District over the last ten-plus years, to\r\nlocate for you those had content qualifying them as public records\r\nrequest.  That likely means the next alternative search methodology would\r\nbe to employ electronic \u201ckeyword\u201d searches, of our \u201cinbound\u201d email\r\ndatabases over the last ten years.  But those sorts of searches could well\r\nbe unreliable, to in-fact yield all such requests, as it would be the case\r\nthat some, if not many, records requestors did not cite our public\r\ndisclosure law in making their requests, nor even use any particular words\r\nor phrasing \u2013 such as \u201cpublic record\u201d \u2013 when submitting their requests.  In\r\nfact, our state\u2019s public disclosure law provides that in order for a public\r\nagency like our District to be compelled to process a records request under\r\nthat statute, the records requestor need only not submit it to a particular\r\nemployee of ours, but s/he need not provide a citation to that public\r\ndisclosure law nor reference it by name or in any other manner, nor use any\r\nparticular language in submitting the request.\r\n\r\nSo, to create a list of \u201ckeyword\u201d search terms that would likely yield\r\nevery single records request that our District has received, via email over\r\nthe last ten-plus years, could indeed be a practical impossibility.\r\nHowever, when faced with such a situation, our public disclosure laws\r\nsuggest we dialogue with a requestor in your position, toward a cooperative\r\ncollaboration aimed at generating a mutually agreed-upon list of keyword\r\nsearch terms that can be used to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nSo, toward that end, I\u2019d like to initiate that dialogue.  Would you please\r\ngive me a call, to discuss that point?\r\n\r\nAside from those difficulties with locating all electronic public records\r\nrequests we\u2019ve received over the last ten-plus years, we of course have\r\nreceived such requests in the form of physical (i.e., paper).  These\r\nlargely would exist only in files contained in boxes in our School\r\nDistrict\u2019s archives.  To search those files will take an immense amount of\r\nstaff time.\r\n\r\nIn any case, because of the number and variety of locations of records\r\nrequests in need of being located, copied, and produced to you in response\r\nto the first segment of your request, we plan to fulfill it in a series of\r\npartial-batch-installments.   We are now estimating that you should expect\r\nto receive the first installment within 90 days of this email\r\n(approximately February 14, 2021).\r\n\r\nAlso, before we provide you that first installment, we likely will need an\r\nadvance pre-payment from you of the cost-of-production charges that are\r\nallowable under our state\u2019s public disclosure law.  I will advise you if\r\nthat will be necessary, and of the required amount, within that same 90-day\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nSecond, as I said above, we are uncertain of the scope of records you wish\r\nus to locate for you, by your language stating you wish to receive: \u201ca\r\ncomplete electronic copy of the District\u2019s Responses\u201d to each of the public\r\nrecords requests we\u2019ll be providing you.   By \u201cResponses,\u201d that could be\r\nfairly interpreted in many different ways, as to the scope of records you\r\ndo or do not wish to receive.  For instance, it could mean you wish only to\r\nreceive copies of the actual; records that School District gathered,\r\ncopied, and provided to each given requestor, in \u201cResponse\u201d to his or her\r\nrequest (i.e., because those records had content falling within the\r\ndescriptive scope of the request).  On the other hand, we frequently\r\n\u201cRespond\u201d to requestors by directing letters or email communications to\r\nthem that contain no actual \u201cResponsive\u201d records, but instead communicate\r\nwith the requestor about any number of points of information or inquiry\r\nthat arise in the course of processing records requests (in fact, this\r\nemail is a precise example of that sort of \u201cResponse\u201d.)\r\n\r\nSo, we\u2019re in need of receiving clarification from you, by way of a\r\nreasonably specific description, as to the scope of records that you do\r\nwish to receive by that second segment of your request.\r\n\r\nPer the above, I will now look forward to the dialogue I\u2019ve initiated with\r\nyou concerning collaboratively working together toward a mutually-agreeable\r\nlist of \u201ckeyword\u201d searches that we can utilize to locate the emailed public\r\nrecords requests you\u2019ve requested, and also to receiving the clarification\r\nI also requested above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJill\r\n*Jill Therrien*\r\n*HR Leaves Specialist *\r\n*Mead School District*\r\n*2323 E Farwell Rd.*\r\n*Mead, WA 99021*\r\n*(509) 465-6049 (p)*\r\n*(509) 465-7680 (f)*\r\n\r\nThe information in this email is confidential, privileged, and/or otherwise\r\nprotected from disclosure.

        "communication": "Dear Requestor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your inquiry about the initial response you received from me\r\nto your records request to our School District, and the one you received\r\nfrom the counterpart representative of mine at the Evergreen School\r\nDistrict.  While we are extremely busy with other matters and our School\r\nDistrict has no obligation to dedicate the time or effort necessary to\r\nanswer your inquiry, we\u2019re more than happy to do so on this occasion.\r\nThat\u2019s because it is essential, for successful fulfillment of your request,\r\nto foster the sort of mutually collaborative dialogue with you that I\r\noffered and requested of you in the very same initial response email about\r\nwhich you are inquiring.  In fact, that sort of affirmative collaborative\r\ncommunication is exactly what the regulations under the Washington Public\r\nRecords Act (\u201cPRA\u201d) call for, reciprocally from a requestor such as\r\nyourself and our District, when questions exist \u2013 as they do here, with\r\nyour request \u2013 about just what particular records do and do not need to be\r\nlocated for production, and when \u2013 also as here \u2013 difficulties are\r\npresented by the request as to how to best go about searching to locate all\r\nresponsive records that happen to exist in electronic form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, please accept the following explanation as to why you received like\r\ninitial responses from our School District and the Evergreen School\r\nDistrict and why the same may well be occurring by this email in response\r\nto the inquiry you\u2019ve now made \u2013 and why that, of course, was and is not at\r\nall a matter of coincidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not infrequent that our School District receives a PRA records\r\nrequest that, by its unique nature, volume, and/or ambiguity, prompts us to\r\ndouble-check on the steps we ought to take to make sure we entirely fulfill\r\nall of the obligations we owe the requestor under the PRA.  And in the\r\ncourse of that, it is not at all uncommon that we find it appropriate to\r\nconsult for assistance/advice with PRA resources outside of our office, for\r\nadditional expertise that might supplement our District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d\r\nPRA-processing experience and abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to requests like yours, we and many other school districts\r\nbelieve that outside consultation is in fact a \u201cbest practice.\u201d  Doing so\r\nnot only operates to the benefit of the school district that is in need of\r\nprocessing the request, but just as much to the benefit of the records\r\nrequestor.  In short, that sort of outside-resource consultation enhances\r\nassurances that the requestor will indeed receive an appropriately-timely\r\nand -thorough production of a copy of every reasonably-locatable,\r\nnon-exempt public record that s/he/it seeks, as the end-product of the\r\ndistrict\u2019s execution of search and production steps that were, from the\r\nvery outset, very concertedly designed to assure that the requestor indeed\r\nreceives full performance of all obligations owed her/him/it under public\r\ndisclosure requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I said, many other school districts in our state engage in that same\r\nbest practice, by seeking supplemental PRA assistance from resources\r\noutside their own records-processing staff, to assure they properly process\r\nand fulfill a request like yours.  And sometimes, some of them by\r\nhappenstance coincidentally consult with to the same, common outside\r\nresource for that assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, when two or more school districts have received the same, identical\r\nrequest, and they happen to have consulted with the same external PRA\r\nresource to help assure they give a proper initial response to the request,\r\nit is not a surprise if they happen to \u201cland on the same spot\u201d in\r\ncommunicating their initial responses to the same request/requestor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what happened here.  Since the verbiage, substance, and detail of\r\nyour requests to both our School District and the Evergreen School District\r\nwere and are precisely identical, we and that District were prompted by a\r\nneed to address with you the exact same records-collection, technology,\r\ntime frame, dialogue/clarification, etc., issues with you, via our\r\nrespective initial responses; and by happenstance, we consulted with the\r\nsame outside source for assistance with our respective initial responses,\r\ntoward the aim of best fulfilling your request to your ultimate\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor that same reason, as I stated above, it would not be surprising and\r\nindeed quite that you may well receive this same explanation, virtually\r\nidentically, to the exact same inquiry you\u2019ve now directed to both of our\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, having provided the foregoing, we want to acknowledge and assure you\r\nthat we in no way plan to provide you any sort of a \u201ccookie cutter\u201d\r\napproach to the continuing processing and fulfillment of your request.\r\nThat could not properly occur under the obligations we owe you under the\r\nPRA.  We fully understand that when a records request we\u2019ve received has\r\nalso been identically submitted to another (or more than one other) school\r\ndistrict, at some point \u2013 usually fairly early on \u2013 that request must and\r\nwill be handled differently and uniquely by us, as compared to the\r\ndifferent sort of handling that (or those) other district(s) must and will\r\nneed to dedicate to their proper processing of that same request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s so for virtually innumerable reasons.  Some of those, just by way of\r\nexamples, would be that we are most certainly differently-situated as\r\ncompared to the Evergreen School District to the particular internal\r\nprocesses we have adopted for processing records requests, once we are\r\nassured we know the specific parameters of the scope of records implicated\r\nby the request; we doubtless have differing particularities in the\r\nprotocols we have followed in our paper and electronic records-filing and\r\n-archiving systems, relative to how and where records responsive to the\r\nrequest in likely to be located in our District; comparatively greater or\r\nlesser staffing levels will exist, as between that District and ours, in\r\nterms of the volume and \u201cquality\u201d of human resources we and they have to\r\ndedicate to the processing of your request, particularly in terms of\r\nexperience or expertise levels amongst records-processing staff members as\r\nto unique issues raised by the request; differences in availability of that\r\nstaff to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other\r\nhigh-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our\r\nrespective Districts\u2019 abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and\r\nprotecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us; the numbers of\r\nemployees outside of our records-processing staffs (e.g.,\r\nadministrators/teachers/others employed in our schools who will need to\r\ndedicate time to assisting in the records-gathering process for the\r\nrequest, and their ability to perform that work while still performing\r\ntheir duties; different levels of experience, technologies, and staff\r\navailability in our respective IT departments who likely will need to work\r\non the request; etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the reasons I\u2019ve stated, the appropriate \u201csameness\u201d of our School\r\nDistrict\u2019s processing of your request, as between ourselves and the\r\nEvergreen School District (or for that matter, as compared to any other\r\nschool district that has received your request) likely will end very\r\nshortly \u2013 indeed we\u2019d expect, upon the occurrence of the requested,\r\ncollaborative dialogue with you on the points that were identified in my\r\ninitial response to you.  So I do look very much look forward to hearing\r\nfrom you so that we can address those points, and we can proceed with the\r\nbenefit of that planned, good discussion in the best possible posture\r\ntoward fulfilling your request in a timely and thorough manner that best\r\nmeets your records and informational needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJill\r\n*Jill Therrien*\r\n*HR Leaves Specialist *\r\n*Mead School District*\r\n*2323 E Farwell Rd.*\r\n*Mead, WA 99021*\r\n*(509) 465-6049 (p)*\r\n*(509) 465-7680 (f)*\r\n\r\nThe information in this email is confidential, privileged, and/or otherwise\r\nprotected from disclosure.

        "communication": "Hello Ms. Therrien,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response.\r\n\r\nI disagree with many of your statements in regards to the District\u2019s legal obligations for compliance with the Washington State Public Records Act. Further, I do not believe your explanation regarding the \u201csameness\u201d of the obviously plagiarized EVERGREEN 11-16-21 email to be offed in good faith. \r\n\r\nPlease note RCW 42.56.030:\r\n\r\n\u2018The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may maintain control over the instruments that they have created. This chapter shall be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed to promote this public policy and to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other act, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.\u2019\r\n\r\nRegardless, the following are responses to your request for \u201cclarification\u201d dated 11-16-2021:\r\n\r\n1. Please address any questions you may have regarding this public records request (PRR) in writing via email.\r\n\r\n2. You stated the District was \u201cuncertain\u201d as to the scope of records requested and you then requested a \u201creasonably specific description\u201d as to the scope of records requested.\r\n\r\nI begin my response below by incorporating the text of the original public records request dated 11-4-2021:\r\n\r\n\u201cI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Mead School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo further clarify this request: \r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all original PRA requests. If the original PRA request was made via email, I request the NATIVE electronic format to be produced. If the original request was made via US mail or limited to written paper form only, I request an electronic .pdf copy of the original request.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all communications between the District and the PRA requestor regarding the processing and any other aspect of production for the PRR. All communications, requests for clarification and replies are responses by the District and were previously requested in my original request. If the communications between the District and the requestor were via email I request the NATIVE electronic email format to be produced. If the communications between the District and the original requestor were limited to written paper form I request a .pdf copy of any communications.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all \u201crecords and writings\u201d as defined by RCW 42.56 previously produced by the District in response to the original PRA request. If the District produced electronic files in response to a PRA request, I request a duplicate copy of the files produced. If the District produced paper copies in response to a PRA request, I request a .pdf copy of those paper copies to be produced. \r\n\r\n3. As for keyword searches and the District\u2019s expressed difficulty in locating electronic and paper public records requests over the years, unfortunately I cannot offer guidance other than to suggest the District immediately seek and retain additional expertise that might supplement District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d PRA-processing experience and abilities. This PRR is not for keywords but rather for public records previously produced by the District.\r\n\r\nPlease reference WAC 44-14-04003 (10) Searching for records.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn agency must conduct an objectively reasonable search for responsive records. The adequacy of a search is judged by the standard of reasonableness. A requestor is not required to \"ferret out\" records on his or her own. A reasonable agency search usually begins with the public records officer for the agency or a records coordinator for a department of the agency deciding where the records are likely to be and who is likely to know where they are. One of the most important parts of an adequate search is to decide how wide the search will be. If the agency is small, it might be appropriate to initially ask all agency employees and officials if they have responsive records. If the agency is larger, the agency may choose to initially ask only the staff of the department or departments of an agency most likely to have the records. For example, a request for records showing or discussing payments on a public works project might initially be directed to all staff in the finance and public works departments if those departments are deemed most likely to have the responsive documents, even though other departments may have copies or alternative versions of the same documents. Meanwhile, other departments that may have documents should be instructed to preserve their records in case they are later deemed to be necessary to respond to the request. The agency could notify the requestor which departments are being surveyed for the documents so the requestor may suggest other departments.\r\n\r\nIf agency employees or officials are using home computers, personal devices, or personal accounts to conduct agency business, those devices and accounts also need to be searched by the employees or officials who are using them when those devices and accounts may have responsive records. If an agency's contractors performing agency work have responsive public records of an agency as a consequence of the agency's contract, they should also be notified of the records request. It is better to be over inclusive rather than under inclusive when deciding which staff or others should be contacted, but not everyone in an agency needs to be asked if there is no reason to believe he or she has responsive records. An email to staff or agency officials selected as most likely to have responsive records is usually sufficient. Such an email also allows an agency to document whom it asked for records. Documentation of searches is recommended. The courts can consider the reasonableness of an agency's search when considering assessing penalties for an agency's failure to produce records.\u201d\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

You have requested:\r\n\r\n\r\n*\"I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests\r\nreceived by Mead School District and a complete electronic copy of the\r\nDistrict's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period\r\nJanuary 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached please find a 1st installment to your request. We would like to\r\nnote a couple of items with this first installment. First, it is smaller\r\nthan we had anticipated being able to provide, as we ran into significant\r\ntechnical issues with collecting the records in the Native format as you\r\nrequested. Secondly, we did have to make some additional redactions to one\r\nof the requests we are providing, as the requestor has changed and certain\r\nFERPA exemptions now apply to the records. In order for us to be able to\r\nmake the applicable redactions we have had to provide those records in PDF\r\nform (with the metadata included). We have also provided a withholding log\r\nthat reflects those redactions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, pursuant to RCW 42.56.520, I am hereby notifying you that the\r\nMead School District estimates we will be able to respond more fully to\r\nyour request on or before March 30, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised of the District's recently updated Policy on providing\r\nrecords, waiver of costs, and agreements regarding costs. The District will\r\ntake reasonable steps to provide the records in the most efficient manner\r\navailable to the District in its normal operations, which will typically be\r\nin electronic format. The following is the District's fee structure for\r\nelectronic records:\r\n\r\n1.  Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format\r\nor for the use of  District equipment to scan the records.\r\n\r\n2.  Five cents per each four electronic files or attachments uploaded to\r\nemail, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\n3.  Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an\r\nelectronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records\r\nelectronically.\r\n\r\n4.  The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the\r\nDistrict, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the\r\ncopies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe charge for the included installment is so de minimis that it has been\r\nwaived at this time. The possible charge for the remaining records,\r\nhowever, likely will not be so de minimis that we could waive charges. So,\r\nplease be prepared that we likely will be asking that you pre-pay before\r\nwe'll be able to provide you with future installments.\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Officer or designee may require a deposit of up to ten\r\npercent of the estimated costs of copying all the records selected by the\r\nrequestor, including the cost of a customized service charge according to\r\nthe provision. If the requestor fails to pay a deposit or final payment for\r\nthe requested copies, the Public Records Officer will close the request and\r\nindicate to the requestor that the District has closed the request.\r\n\r\nIf requested, the District will provide a summary of the applicable charges\r\nbefore charges are imposed under this procedure. The requestor will be\r\nallowed to revise the request in order to reduce the applicable charges.\r\n\r\nThe following links provide more detailed information regarding the\r\nDistrict's Public Records Policy\r\n<https://www.mead354.org/ourpages/Board-Policies//Series%204000%20-%20Community%20Relations/4040_Policy_-_Public_Access_to_District_Records.pdf>\r\n and Procedure\r\n<https://www.mead354.org/ourpages/Board-Policies//Series%204000%20-%20Community%20Relations/4040_Procedure_-_Public_Access_to_District_Records.pdf>\r\n.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJill\r\n*Jill Therrien*\r\n*HR Leaves Specialist *\r\n*Mead School District*\r\n*2323 E Farwell Rd.*\r\n*Mead, WA 99021*\r\n*(509) 465-6049 (p)*\r\n*(509) 465-7680 (f)*\r\n\r\nThe information in this email is confidential, privileged, and/or otherwise\r\nprotected from disclosure.

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).

This includes, but is not limited to, documents, reports, multimedia, body-worn camera footage, arrest filings, and so on. It also includes all documents, notes, correspondence and memoranda evidencing sustained findings reports and investigations, and all communication and correspondence in whatever tangible medium between the officials, the victims and the overseeing agency.\r\n\r\nI am requesting digital copies of all responsive documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nHere, misconduct includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\nExcessive (unreasonable) force \u2013 beatings, manhandling of people in handcuffs, improper use of Tasers, injuries inflicted by police dogs, improper use of deadly force, and other police brutality or disregard for the safety of suspects. It also includes, but is not limited to: physical and verbal abuse, restraints happening unreasonably, coerced or forced confessions, and sexual abuse and assault.\r\n\r\nFalse arrests \u2013 pulling over, detention, questioning and searches conducted without any probable cause whatsoever, including cases of planted evidence, racial profiling and trumped-up charges of resisting arrest.\r\n\r\nAs of March 2022, public officials must release police disciplinary records in New Jersey when the public\u2019s interest in them outweighs an officer\u2019s confidentiality concerns, the state\u2019s top court ruled.\r\n\r\nThe law requires that you respond to and fulfill this request \"as promptly as possible.\" If you expect a significant delay in responding to and fulfilling this request, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 415-769-8210 or ananyatiwarijournalism@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

Specifically, I am seeking electronic listings of all individuals employed within all state agencies, commissions, and departments for each month from January 2019 through March 2022.\r\n\r\nThis is an updated request from my original request, which I submitted on May 11, 2022. In addition to the variables I received from my original request (first name, middle name, last name, suffix, annual salary, agency, job class title, position title, ethnic origin, and gender), I would like to request the following fields: employee date of birth or age, civil service status (classified, unclassified, etc.), original date employee was hired by the state, and the location the employee works (for instance, county, address of workplace, and/or name of workplace (e.g. Livesay Correctional Institution)) . \r\n\r\nIf you cannot produce any of these fields, please let me know and generate only the available variables.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.
