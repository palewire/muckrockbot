Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action. \r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force. \r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes: \r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm]. \r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of the U.S. Coast Guard personnel records (OMPF) for a former servicemember named HUGH MARSTON HEFNER (DATE OF BIRTH: 04/09/1926). Mr. Hefner was born in Chicago, Illinois. He served in the U.S. Army from 1944 to 1946 and achieved the rank of private first class (PFC). The requested records include performance reports, job assessments, disciplinary records, training received, discharge papers, and any other releasable records.\r\n\r\nThe public interest in Mr. Hefner, the founder of \"Playboy\" magazine, should favor disclosure of many of these records, particularly in relation to any disciplinary records, should those records exist.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to review and release any segregable information, even if certain documents or portions of documents are withheld.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not a next of kin of this servicemember, and thus do not know Mr. Hefner\u2019s Social Security Number. Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s relevant provisions. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

That is, the OMPF has been transferred by\r\nthe originating military service department to the legal custody of the\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration (NARA).\r\n\r\nAmong these are the OMPFs of many prominent individuals such as military\r\nheroes, political leaders, cultural figures, celebrities, and entertainers.\r\nThese records, designated as files of Persons of Exceptional Prominence, or\r\nPEPs, are some of the most intrinsically valuable holdings in the NARA\r\nsystem today.\r\n\r\nThe requested PEP OMPF is now a public record.  You may gain access to this\r\nrecord and its contents by purchasing high-resolution scans of the file.\r\nThe NARA staff does not respond to requests for archival records by\r\nfurnishing selected documents or extracts of information such as the\r\ninformation typically provided through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\r\nrequest.\r\nYou will receive an email from Pay.gov regarding access to your bill\r\nonline.  Simply go to the link provided and enter the Access Code listed in\r\nthe email.  You will be prompted to answer a security question.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the security question is: 4267\r\n\r\nPlease submit your payment within 30 days.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions regarding Pay.gov, please contact their customer\r\nservice at 800-624-1373 or pay.gov.clev@clev.frb.org.  If you have\r\nquestions regarding your records order, please contact the National\r\nArchives at St. Louis.\r\n\r\nOnce payment is received, a high-resolution PDF scan of the record will be\r\nmade (Please allow 30 days for the scanning and uploading process to be\r\ncompleted), and a link to access the digital copy of the record will be\r\nemailed to you at 167829-21634267@requests.muckrock.com. If payment is not\r\nreceived within this period, we will assume that you no longer desire a\r\ncopy of this record, and your request will be closed automatically without\r\nfurther action.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nKayla\r\n-- \r\nKayla Dawkins\r\nReference Archives Specialist\r\nNational Archives & Records Administration\r\nRoom 340, 1 Archives Drive\r\nSaint Louis, MO  63138",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (CPRA) to the  Fresno County Probation Department  from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) for records related to AB 2448 (CA Welf & Inst Code \u00a7 851.1. Online:  https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/welfare-and-institutions-code/wic-sect-851-1/), a 2018 law that requires juvenile detention facilities to provide youth in custody with internet access.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this law establishes the following requirements for juvenile detention facilities: \r\n\r\n\u201cMinors detained in or committed to a juvenile hall shall be provided with access to computer technology and the Internet for the purposes of education.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe law also allows juvenile halls to provide access to computers and the internet for \u201cmaintaining relationships with family.\u201d The Chief Probation Officer, or their designee, may \u201climit or deny access to computer technology or the Internet for safety and security or staffing reasons.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe request the following Fresno County Probation Department records: \r\n\r\n1. All policies, procedures, practices, manuals, memorandums, orders or related documents that discuss providing minors in juvenile hall with access to computer technology and the internet for educational purposes; \r\n2. All policies, procedures, practices, manuals, memorandums, orders or related documents that discuss providing minors in juvenile hall with access to computer technology and the internet for maintaining familial relationships; \r\n3. All handbooks or similar documents provided to teachers and other instructors that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet in juvenile hall; \r\n4. All handbooks or similar documents provided to minors in juvenile hall that describe the process, rules, and guidelines for accessing computer technology and the internet; \r\n5. All procurement records, such as RFPs, RFIs, solicitations, successful bids, and contracts/agreements with vendors for technology systems to provide minors in juvenile hall with access to computing and internet-connected technology; \r\n6. Examples of any consent, permission, and similar documents provided to parents and guardians of minors in juvenile hall related to access to computer technology and the internet;\r\n7. Any quarterly, annual, or other periodic reports that summarize the implementation of programs to comply with AB 2448 generated since 2018;\r\n8. Logs, records, or orders related to suspension of internet access, for any amount of time, \u201cfor safety and security or staffing reasons\u201d since 2018; and\r\n9. Aggregate data on the number of juvenile users of computer technology and internet systems for the period 2022 and 2023.\r\n\r\nShould these records not exist, we would appreciate a statement as to whether the agency is in compliance with AB 2448. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we request the following information and assistance, as required under CPRA: \r\n- Assistance in identifying additional records and information that will assist us in understanding the state of the agency\u2019s compliance with AB 2448;\r\n- A description of the information technology and physical location in which the records exist; and\r\n- Suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records and information sought. \r\n\r\nThe CPRA also requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available.\r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $50.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $50.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at the Muckrock.com email above or my direct email, dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy St. San Francisco, CA, 94109, or leave a voicemail message at 415-436-9333 x151.                                          \r\nSincerely,\r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c.  4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest  and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tPlease provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic,  and incident  information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5.\tPlease also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n6.\tA copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n\r\n7.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n8.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record.

        "communication": "Dear Erin Stewart \r\nThank you for your interest in public records of Boston Police Department. Your request has been received and is being processed. Your request was received in this office on 5/16/2022 10:20:42 PM and given the reference number B001299-051622 for tracking purposes. \r\nIf this is a media request, please contact the Office of Media Relations directly at 617.343.4520. \r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n\r\n7.

The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format.

See A Guide to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, p. 32, n.115.\u00a0 It is expected that a custodian of records must use her superior knowledge of her records with respect to responses to public records requests.\u00a0 950 CMR 32.04(5).\u00a0 Specifically, you stated: \r\nTo Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nTo whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d \r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: \r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement \r\nc. Charge (or charges) \r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement \r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. \r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. \r\n\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0. \r\n\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools. \r\n\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and, \r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b). \r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs. \r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nErin Stewart \r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice \r\n(617) 338-1050 \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage. \r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nErin Stewart \r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fboston-police-department-174%252Fschool-based-arrest-data-request-boston-police-department-128867%252F%253Femail%253Dshawn.williams%252540boston.gov&url_auth_token=AAAj3akswzqXV9UicURLv4wh7to%3A1nqmmx%3AFyiXymPVN8vhHllLdVmXEw9fu5bH2GF6NZmFnrIJ7HY \r\n\r\n[SPR22/1855] Your request would require the Boston Police Department conduct research to create a record that does not yet exist.\u00a0 As a records custodian is not required to create a record, I suggest you contact the Boston Police Department's Public Service Unit.\u00a0 To obtain a copy of a police report or accident report please contact: POLICEREPORT@PD.BOSTON.GOV \r\nPlease send a copy of your identification.\u00a0 This is needed in the event you have a special right of access to a record that is not available to the average person.\u00a0 If this identification is not needed it will be discarded.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

Adella Parker went by the names of Adele Parker, Adele Parker-Bennett, or Adela Parker. Adella Parker was a suffragist, lawyer and journalist who spent most of her life in Seattle. She was the Moscow correspondent for William Randolph Hearst's International News Service between 1922 and 1923. Parker was also the publisher of a newspaper called the \"Western Woman Voter\" which was published in Seattle between 1911 and 1913. \r\n\r\nThere are a handful of blog posts online that discuss her interesting historical background: https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2013/12/chs-retake-writer-shares-lost-seattle/\r\n\r\nPlease search for any mentions of her articles published in either the Western Woman Voter newspaper, or by the International News Service. Please also search for any records related to her time serving in the Washington State House of Representatives from 1935 to 1937. Of particular interest would be records mentioning the Centralia massacre of 1919 and her trip through Russia following the Russian revolution. \r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Adella Parker. \r\n\r\nAccording to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Adella Parker. \r\n\r\nThank you for your commitment to transparency. This is an important person in Seattle history, and the thorough search for any records, along with the release of any records should they exist, is the the public interest.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the \u2018Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request\u2019 link.  Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 152 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 922 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,964 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,360 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request medium processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is October 2023.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  If you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please indicate so and a representative will be in contact.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Thank you for taking the time to read this message. I just received a message dated May 9th, 2024 about my FOIPA request for records related to ADELLA PARKER. PARKER was a Washington State based journalist and political activist. The FOIPA Request number for this request is 1492689-000. There have been approximately 258 pages of potentially responsive documents located. \r\n\r\nIt was indicated in the message that was sent to me, that the request for ADELLA PARKER is in the \u201cmedium track\u201d and it was asked if I was still interested in having the request processed, or if I was interested in reducing the request to a smaller processing track. The message sent to me indicated that a response is required in 30 days. \r\n\r\nPlease consider this message as a reply to your letter. My response is as follows:\r\n\r\nPlease continue on with the request. I believe it is of historical interest and the release of these records is in the public good. \r\nPlease continue on with this request in the medium track. \r\n\r\nI will work towards the release of these records for as long as it takes. Thank you for the update and reply, and thank you all for your commitment to transparency. \r\n\r\n-Robert \u201cRobby\u201d Delaware",

And under \u201carticle 28 C.F.R. \u00a716.5 (e)(1)(ii)\u201d I intend to write an article about the untimely death of Kim Porter, focusing on how she died and the controversy surrounding it. Reportedly, she had shared with friends credible threats to her life and was a victim of multiple domestic violence incidents. I understand that her family has suspicions regarding her death, which further adds to the importance of exploring the circumstances surrounding it. This information will be used in preparation for upcoming articles on my personal website.

I request the disclosure of all LAPD and FBI records on Kim Porter, including her autopsy report, police files, and any other relevant documents.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYour request was made under the California Public Records Act (the Act). The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the Act. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The Act does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the Act recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the Act or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Sections 7923.600-7923.625 of the California Government Code, records of investigations conducted by, or investigatory files compiled by, any local police agency for law enforcement purposes, are exempt from disclosure. To the extent that records were located, they are either investigatory records themselves or properly part of an investigative file. Therefore, we are denying your request. The records may be provided pursuant to a subpoena or court order related to pending litigation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nShould any records be located, to the extent the information is recorded, a summary including the time, date, and location of occurrence, the time and date of the call or report, the name and age of the victim, and a brief statement of the circumstances may be made available to you upon request.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that this response does not include any records that may be in the custody of other City departments or public agencies. Each City department or government agency maintains and is responsible for its own records.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn regard to autopsy reports, please be advised that the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner Coroner\u2019s Office maintains autopsy-related records and handles requests for copies of the coroner report which includes the autopsy and\u00a0investigation reports.\u00a0These may include any or all of the following reports: toxicology, criminalist, gunshot residue, and a variety of consultant reports.\u00a0To make a request for one of these items, please visit their website at\u00a0https://me.lacounty.gov/. You may also find information responsive to your request at the following link.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCase Detail \u2013 Medical Examiner (lacounty.gov) https://me.lacounty.gov/case-detail/?caseNumber=2018-08709\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe FBI may have records responsive to your request.

This request was rejected on the grounds that I could not demonstrate that disclosure of the requested records to me would constitute a \"significant\" benefit to public knowledge of NASA'a activities. Specifically, my claim was characterized as \"speculative.\" In considering my appeal, I ask whomever it may concern to consider that, in addition to my qualifications as stated in the original request, I am the editor-in-chief of a magazine (currently digital but soon to be in print) called \"Cultural Engineering Studies,\" and I personally contributed an article to this magazine on NASA's relationship to Hollywood--an almost unexplored topic. So it seems arbitrary to conclude that this information will not benefit public awareness in a \"significant\" way. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for considering my appeal,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

If more than 4 hours of employee time is required to search for, compile, segregate, redact or reproduce the records requested, a fee may be charged at an hourly rate equal to or less than the hourly rate attributed to the lowest paid employee who has the necessary skill required to complete the record request, which rate shall not exceed twenty-five dollars ($25) per hour.\r\n\r\nWe will begin the process of calculating this fee. Please note that payment of the fee will be required prior to the completion of the request. If the actual costs are less than the estimated fee, a refund will be issued. If the actual costs are greater than the estimated fee, a revised fee estimate will be issued.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPatrick Stone\r\n\r\n\r\nPatrick Stone\r\nDirector of Strategic Communications and Marketing\r\nCape Cod Community College\r\n774-330-4714\r\npstone@capecod.edu<mailto:pstone@capecod.edu>\r\n\r\n[Image]\r\n\r\n[Image]<https://www.facebook.com/CapeCodCommunityCollege/>[Image]<https://www.instagram.com/capecodcc/> [Image] <https://twitter.com/capecodcomcol>  [Image] <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fTjw_c8yLGB_Zb6WZEqEg>\n",

Before you can check the status, you must have received correspondence assigning a FOIPA request number and the information transferred to the online database. Status information is updated weekly. If a request has been closed within the last six months the online database will display the following: The FOIPA number entered has been closed, and appropriate correspondence has been sent to the address on file.\r\n\r\nEstimated Dates of Completion\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Our complex requests are further divided into small (51-250 pages), medium (251-500 pages), large (501-4,999), and extra-large (over 5,000 pages) sub-tracks.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing. Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, simple track cases average approximately 122 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Complex requests in the small processing track are currently averaging 360 days from the date of receipt for processing, those in the medium processing track are currently averaging 1,230 days, those in the large processing track are currently averaging approximately 2,010 days, and those in the extra-large track are averaging 2,370 days.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nFBI - Information Management Division\r\n200 Constitution Drive\r\nWinchester, VA  22602\r\nO: (540) 868-4593\r\nE: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

        "communication": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal of the determination on FOIL request DOCCS-23-07-235. The request yielded 12 pages, which consisted of a DOCCS Directive  8700, titled \"Community Preparation Case \u2013 Assignment and Release Investigation Process.\"\r\n\r\nDOCCS cited three FOIL statute exemptions in redacting the document. Among them is Public Officers Law \u00a787(2)(g): \"inter/intra agency materials which are not final agency policy or decisions, statistical or factual tabulations, external audits, or instructions to staff that affect the public.\"\r\n\r\nAs a DOCCS directive, the document is by definition a final agency policy. Thus POL \u00a787(2)(g) does not apply. Thus I request that DOCCS:\r\n\r\n(a) itemize the redactions, explaining which FOIL statute exemption applies to each, and\r\n(b) unredact all portions of the document which cite POL \u00a787(2)(g) as the justification.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. My phone number is (419) 309-6331.\r\n\r\nSicnerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",

Mr. Grossman was born in Ellensburg, Washington. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 2006 to 2008 and achieved the rank of airman first class (A1C). The requested records include performance reports, job assessments, disciplinary records, training received, discharge papers, and any other releasable records.\r\n\r\nThe public interest in Mr. Grossman, known popularly as the children's entertainer \"Blippi,\" should favor disclosure of many of these records, particularly in relation to any disciplinary records, should those records exist.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to review and release any segregable information, even if certain documents or portions of documents are withheld.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not a next of kin of this servicemember, and thus do not know Mr. Grossman's Social Security Number. Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the Freedom of Information Act\u2019s relevant provisions. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",

The OTD reports covers the FBI's findings regarding the likelihood of an attack on U.S. diplomats using so-called \"sonic weapons,\" while the latter BAU report includes conclusions about the psychological states of Havana Syndrome victims based, according to Entous, \"on transcripts of previous interviews that the F.B.I. had done with the patients.\" There should be no concerns over national security in releasing these reports. Similar information is conveyed in a 2018 report commissioned by the State Department and issued by the JASON advisory group, and is publicly accessible courtesy of a Buzzfeed News article published on September 30, 2021 (\"A Declassified State Department Report Says Microwaves Didn\u2019t Cause 'Havana Syndrome'\"); the National Academies of the Sciences also published findings on the subject in a 2020 report titled \"An Assessment of Illness in U.S. Government Employees and Their Families at Overseas Embassies\".\r\n\r\nThe OTD and BAU reports are of immense public interest at this time. The BAU report in specific has been referenced in over a dozen articles since Entous first reported on it, including additional coverage in The New Yorker, as well as writing in the following publications: the Harvard Gazette (\"Rush to stop \u2018Havana syndrome\u2019\", October 8, 2021); Reuters (\"FBI calls dealing with 'Havana Syndrome' a top priority\", November 24, 2021); and the New York Times (\"Most \u2018Havana Syndrome\u2019 Cases Unlikely Caused by Foreign Power, C.I.A. Says\", January 20, 2022). The newsworthiness of Havana Syndrome alone should warrant the release of both reports but the fact that the BAU report continues to appear in news coverage indicates that it too is an item of continued public interest. Additionally, Entous has already reported the conclusion of the BAU report in The New Yorker article, noting that the Bureau ruled patients suffering from Havana Syndrome were/are suffering from some form of psychogenic illness. Although the Bureau may no longer hold this position publicly, prior disclosure of this information by a news organization should nullify any need for discretion, whether on behalf of the patients or the Bureau.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request.

All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires.
