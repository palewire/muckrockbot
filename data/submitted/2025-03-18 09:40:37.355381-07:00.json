According to reports, during this incident, Officer McWilliams was overpowered by a suspect who seized the officer\u2019s firearm and discharged one round, grazing Officer McWilliams. A passing bystander, an unidentified 34-year-old man, intervened and assisted in subduing the suspect until backup officers arrived. Police body camera footage reportedly shows the bystander tackling the assailant from behind at a critical moment. The incident is documented under Amarillo PD Report #2023-000821, noting that the civilian's assistance likely saved the officer\u2019s life.\r\n\r\nI am seeking the following records related to this incident:\r\n\r\nIncident and Arrest Reports: Complete reports detailing the events leading to and during the incident, including officer narratives, witness statements, and any supplementary documentation.\r\n\r\nBody-Worn Camera Footage: All available footage from officers involved in the incident, capturing interactions with the suspect and the bystander from initial contact through the resolution of the situation.\r\n\r\nDashboard Camera Footage: Any available footage from patrol vehicles present during the incident, particularly those capturing the scene upon arrival and the subsequent events.\r\n\r\n911 Call Records and Dispatch Logs: Audio recordings and transcripts of any emergency calls or dispatch communications related to this incident, including radio communications and Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) logs.\r\n\r\nPhotographs: Any images taken by the Amarillo Police Department during or after the incident, including photographs of Officer McWilliams, the suspect, the bystander, and the scene.\r\n\r\nUse-of-Force Reports: Documentation of any use-of-force reports filed in relation to this incident.\r\n\r\nCommendations or Recognitions: Any records of commendations or official recognitions awarded to the bystander for his actions during this incident.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this request is to serve the public interest by making these records publicly accessible. While I acknowledge that I may also generate revenue from disseminating these materials, the request primarily aims to enhance transparency regarding this law enforcement incident.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees associated with fulfilling this request, as disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding of law enforcement practices and community interactions. However, if a full fee waiver is not possible, please inform me of the estimated costs in advance. Additionally, if fees can be reduced or eliminated by excluding certain records, please specify which records those would be.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records in an electronic format if available.

Deputy Likus, 36, was off-duty when Cape Coral Police Department officers conducted a traffic stop due to erratic driving and a minor traffic violation. He reportedly identified himself as a deputy and expected leniency; however, after failing sobriety tests, he was arrested for DUI. Subsequently, the Lee County Sheriff's Office placed him on administrative leave without pay pending an investigation.\r\n\r\nI am seeking the following records related to this incident:\r\n\r\nIncident and Arrest Reports: Complete reports detailing the events leading to the traffic stop, observations made by the officers, results of sobriety tests, and the arrest of Deputy Likus, including any supplementary narratives.\r\n\r\nBody-Worn Camera Footage: All available footage from officers involved in the traffic stop and arrest, capturing the interaction with Deputy Likus from the initial stop through the arrest.\r\n\r\nDashboard Camera Footage: Any available footage from patrol vehicles present during the incident, particularly those capturing the driving behavior leading to the stop and the subsequent arrest.\r\n\r\n911 Call Records and Dispatch Logs: Audio recordings and transcripts of any emergency calls or dispatch communications related to this incident, including radio communications and Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) logs.\r\n\r\nPhotographs: Any images taken by the Cape Coral Police Department during or after the arrest, including photographs of Deputy Likus, his vehicle, and the scene.\r\n\r\nBreathalyzer or Blood Test Results: Documentation of any breathalyzer or blood alcohol content (BAC) tests administered to Deputy Likus, including the results indicating a BAC of 0.15.\r\n\r\nInternal Affairs Reports: Any internal reviews, use-of-force reports, or investigations conducted by the Cape Coral Police Department or the Lee County Sheriff's Office regarding this incident.\r\n\r\nPress Releases or Official Statements: Any public communications released by the Cape Coral Police Department or the Lee County Sheriff's Office concerning this incident.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this request is to serve the public interest by making these records publicly accessible. While I acknowledge that I may also generate revenue from disseminating these materials, the request primarily aims to enhance transparency regarding this law enforcement incident.\r\n\r\nI request a waiver of fees associated with fulfilling this request, as disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding of law enforcement practices and accountability. However, if a full fee waiver is not possible, please inform me of the estimated costs in advance. Additionally, if fees can be reduced or eliminated by excluding certain records, please specify which records those would be.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the records in an electronic format if available. If any portions of this request are denied, please cite the specific legal exemption(s) and provide a redacted version of the document where applicable.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

On this date, a group of teenagers reportedly engaged in disruptive activities inspired by a TikTok \"milk crate\" challenge, which escalated into a public disturbance. Actions included throwing milk jugs, entering a live lobster tank, and defying store security. Upon police arrival, the teenagers allegedly used profane language and refused orders to disperse, necessitating backup units.

De Hoyos has never made an arrest, please provide a sworn statement confirming his current employment status and exact dates of service with the McAllen Police Department, from his hire date of September 26, 2022, to the present (March 17, 2025).\r\nArrest Reports: If Officer De Hoyos has made arrests, provide all arrest reports from September 26, 2022, to March 17, 2025, where he is listed as the arresting officer, including:\r\nReport number\r\nDate of arrest\r\nCharges filed\r\nName of the individual arrested\r\nPlease note that records for cases no longer under active investigation are not exempt under TPIA and must be disclosed.\r\nDisciplinary Records: All disciplinary records, internal affairs investigations, reprimands, and citizen complaints involving Officer Edgar I. De Hoyos, from September 26, 2022, to March 17, 2025, including:\r\nDates of incidents\r\nSummaries of allegations\r\nResolutions or outcomes\r\nIf these records are held by the Civil Service Office per your prior referral, please coordinate with that office to fulfill this request or provide their direct contact for a separate submission.\r\nThis request pertains to existing records only, as required under TPIA. Given Officer De Hoyos\u2019 documented role as a Police Officer III in the Tactical Patrol Unit (effective September 9, 2024), it is implausible that no arrest records exist after over two years of service. Be advised that this is part of a broader, ongoing investigation into potential misconduct specifically police brutality, and any failure to comply fully with TPIA may result in escalation to the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office for review.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this request is deemed exempt, please cite the specific TPIA exemption and provide non-exempt portions as required by law. If a determination from the Texas Attorney General is sought, please provide a copy of that request and the subsequent ruling. I expect a response within 10 business days, per TPIA \u00a7552.221.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
