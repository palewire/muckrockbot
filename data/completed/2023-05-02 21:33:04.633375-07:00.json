If there is anything else I can assist with please let me know.\r\n\r\nYour request was as follows:\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\nPursuant to the Alabama Public Records, I hereby request the following records:\r\nAll adverse actions taken against teacher licenses or certificates as reported to the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification (NASDTEC), including but not limited to public reprimands, denials, invalidations, annulments, revocations, suspensions, and voluntary surrenders, with the nature and description of the reason for action (i.e., sexual misconduct, breach of contract, incompetence, etc.) noted alongside the full names of every teacher, from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2022.\r\nI would like these records in the electronic format that they are stored in, transmitted via email or other digital method; please refrain from sending paper copies of the records.\r\nRather than provide all responsive records at once, I ask that you provide copies of records on a rolling basis, as they become available.\r\nIf you determine that any of the information qualifies for an exemption from disclosure, I ask you to note whether the exemption is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion to withhold the information. In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which you rely if you determine that any of the information is exempt and will not be disclosed.\r\nPlease waive any applicable fees; this information is being sought for reporting purposes.\r\nNote: A delay in access to these records is tantamount to a denial of access.\r\nThank you for your timely attention to this matter.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\nSincerely,\r\nAndr\u00e9 Natta, a citizen of Alabama, in coordination with Insider Staff.\r\nView request history, upload responsive documents, and report problems here:\r\nhttps://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Falabama-state-department-of-education-18308%252Fjanuary-30-business-insider-public-records-request-139744%252F%253Femail%253Dcomm%252540alsde.edu&url_auth_token=AABhH18FZY9QY6tkf-xoZXwnl6k%3A1pMNN6%3AUJzZoT53ka_v9quJcEpD62j10nRcshl2M3_1xo7CW_o\r\nIf prompted for a passcode, please enter:\r\nYWREAGKR\r\nFiled via MuckRock.com\r\nE-mail (Preferred): 139744-93305949@requests.muckrock.com<mailto:139744-93305949@requests.muckrock.com>\r\nPLEASE NOTE OUR NEW ADDRESS\r\nFor mailed responses, please address (see note):\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 139744\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMichael O.

Each Call Sheet includes a list of Fire Department employees at the time of the call, member certifications, what members responded to the call, the response role of each member, the staffing of each apparatus that responded, and the total members that responded to the call. The back side of the call sheet may also include a brief handwritten 1-2 sentence description of the call and the actions taken by the Fire Department. Each Call Sheet has a corresponding Dispatch Times sheet provided by Derry Fire Alarm showing the details of the call (address, determinant level for EMS calls, units responding, and the times of each unit responding). It is believed that these records are located at the Chester Fire Department and are believed to be contained within 3-ring binders with each Dispatch Times Sheet stored together with the corresponding Call Sheet.\r\n\r\nThis request does NOT include official incident reports created by the Chester Fire Department and submitted to NFIRS.  \r\n\r\nPARTICIPATION REPORTS\r\nChester Fire Department participation reports from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2023 (including the quarterly report JAN-2023 through MAR-2023). These reports are kept in Office Manager Ingalls office on the wall immediately to the left of the door. These reports list the call, training, and combined participation percentages of every member on a monthly and quarterly basis. These reports show the participation of employees acting in their official capacities as municipal employees and provide insight into the efficiency/effectiveness of the Department and inform the public of the staffing level regularly available for emergency calls.\r\n\r\nTRUCK CHECK SHEETS\r\nTruck Check sheets for all apparatus (Rescue 1, Engine 1, Engine 2, Tank 1, Utility 1, Forestry 1, Forestry 2, and Car 1) from January 1, 2023 through April 1, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. The purpose of this request is to obtain the data necessary to generate statistics in aggregate concerning the staffing/certification level over a period of time and the availability of resources for emergencies. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin J Dolan",

I will plan to review the available documents at the Town Clerk's office next Tuesday 4/25/23 during normal the business hours.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Department Call Sheets, I would like to clarify the specific type and location of the confidential information the review process is seeking to redact. Based on my understanding, the only possibility for confidential information to be contained within the call sheets concerns the mobile messaging system between Derry Dispatch, Chester Rescue 1, and Chester Car 1 via the Mobile Data Terminals in those apparatus. These messages may contain confidential information such as a door code or key locations. For the purpose of this request, any of these instant messages contained on any of the dispatch times sheets are not requested and may be redacted in full to expedite the review process. \r\n\r\nBeyond these instant messages please clarify what other potential there is for the call sheets to contain confidential information as I am not aware of any other possibilities. \r\n\r\nI would like to avoid a situation where time is spent reviewing documents and redacting information that is later disputed as I highly value everyone's time. Given the long two month lead time I am concerned information may be redacted that does not qualify as confidential under RSA 91-A. My hope is that any potential areas of confidential information including where it is located within the requested documents can be discussed up front in order to simplify the review process and prevent any possible duplicative effort. \r\n\r\nThank you and respectfully,\r\nKevin J Dolan",

        "communication": "Dear Records Requestor:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mead School District received your public records request on November\r\n9, 2021. This serves as the District\u2019s response within five (5) business\r\ndays, as required by law.  You have requested:\r\n\r\n\r\n*\"I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests\r\nreceived by Mead School District and a complete electronic copy of the\r\nDistrict's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period\r\nJanuary 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\nYour records request seems clear in one respect, as to the records you wish\r\nto have copied and provided to you by the initial segment of your request.\r\nBut, the second segment of your request is not clear to us.  So, we are in\r\nneed of clarification from you as to that segment.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is clear by the first segment of your request that you wish to\r\nreceive a copy of every public records request that has been submitted to\r\nour School District, going back historically for more than a decade, to\r\nJanuary 1, 2010.\r\n\r\nIt will be a daunting and time-consuming task to locate all of those\r\nrecords for duplication and production to you.  Some of those requests\r\nwould have been received by us in electronic format only, e.g., such as via\r\nemail.  Those would not have been forwarded to any central electronic file\r\nlocation, nor printed to a paper copy and placed in any particular physical\r\nfile location.  As well, requests of that sort would not necessarily have\r\nbeen received by the person designated as our public records officer at the\r\ntime the request was received.  Rather, any given request could conceivably\r\nbeen received by any other given employee in our District.\r\n\r\nFor additional reasons, designing a search methodology calculated to locate\r\nall such emailed requests would be very difficult, if not impossible.  That\r\nis because we cannot be required to read every single email received by\r\nevery employee in our School District over the last ten-plus years, to\r\nlocate for you those had content qualifying them as public records\r\nrequest.  That likely means the next alternative search methodology would\r\nbe to employ electronic \u201ckeyword\u201d searches, of our \u201cinbound\u201d email\r\ndatabases over the last ten years.  But those sorts of searches could well\r\nbe unreliable, to in-fact yield all such requests, as it would be the case\r\nthat some, if not many, records requestors did not cite our public\r\ndisclosure law in making their requests, nor even use any particular words\r\nor phrasing \u2013 such as \u201cpublic record\u201d \u2013 when submitting their requests.  In\r\nfact, our state\u2019s public disclosure law provides that in order for a public\r\nagency like our District to be compelled to process a records request under\r\nthat statute, the records requestor need only not submit it to a particular\r\nemployee of ours, but s/he need not provide a citation to that public\r\ndisclosure law nor reference it by name or in any other manner, nor use any\r\nparticular language in submitting the request.\r\n\r\nSo, to create a list of \u201ckeyword\u201d search terms that would likely yield\r\nevery single records request that our District has received, via email over\r\nthe last ten-plus years, could indeed be a practical impossibility.\r\nHowever, when faced with such a situation, our public disclosure laws\r\nsuggest we dialogue with a requestor in your position, toward a cooperative\r\ncollaboration aimed at generating a mutually agreed-upon list of keyword\r\nsearch terms that can be used to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nSo, toward that end, I\u2019d like to initiate that dialogue.  Would you please\r\ngive me a call, to discuss that point?\r\n\r\nAside from those difficulties with locating all electronic public records\r\nrequests we\u2019ve received over the last ten-plus years, we of course have\r\nreceived such requests in the form of physical (i.e., paper).  These\r\nlargely would exist only in files contained in boxes in our School\r\nDistrict\u2019s archives.  To search those files will take an immense amount of\r\nstaff time.\r\n\r\nIn any case, because of the number and variety of locations of records\r\nrequests in need of being located, copied, and produced to you in response\r\nto the first segment of your request, we plan to fulfill it in a series of\r\npartial-batch-installments.   We are now estimating that you should expect\r\nto receive the first installment within 90 days of this email\r\n(approximately February 14, 2021).\r\n\r\nAlso, before we provide you that first installment, we likely will need an\r\nadvance pre-payment from you of the cost-of-production charges that are\r\nallowable under our state\u2019s public disclosure law.  I will advise you if\r\nthat will be necessary, and of the required amount, within that same 90-day\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nSecond, as I said above, we are uncertain of the scope of records you wish\r\nus to locate for you, by your language stating you wish to receive: \u201ca\r\ncomplete electronic copy of the District\u2019s Responses\u201d to each of the public\r\nrecords requests we\u2019ll be providing you.   By \u201cResponses,\u201d that could be\r\nfairly interpreted in many different ways, as to the scope of records you\r\ndo or do not wish to receive.  For instance, it could mean you wish only to\r\nreceive copies of the actual; records that School District gathered,\r\ncopied, and provided to each given requestor, in \u201cResponse\u201d to his or her\r\nrequest (i.e., because those records had content falling within the\r\ndescriptive scope of the request).  On the other hand, we frequently\r\n\u201cRespond\u201d to requestors by directing letters or email communications to\r\nthem that contain no actual \u201cResponsive\u201d records, but instead communicate\r\nwith the requestor about any number of points of information or inquiry\r\nthat arise in the course of processing records requests (in fact, this\r\nemail is a precise example of that sort of \u201cResponse\u201d.)\r\n\r\nSo, we\u2019re in need of receiving clarification from you, by way of a\r\nreasonably specific description, as to the scope of records that you do\r\nwish to receive by that second segment of your request.\r\n\r\nPer the above, I will now look forward to the dialogue I\u2019ve initiated with\r\nyou concerning collaboratively working together toward a mutually-agreeable\r\nlist of \u201ckeyword\u201d searches that we can utilize to locate the emailed public\r\nrecords requests you\u2019ve requested, and also to receiving the clarification\r\nI also requested above.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJill\r\n*Jill Therrien*\r\n*HR Leaves Specialist *\r\n*Mead School District*\r\n*2323 E Farwell Rd.*\r\n*Mead, WA 99021*\r\n*(509) 465-6049 (p)*\r\n*(509) 465-7680 (f)*\r\n\r\nThe information in this email is confidential, privileged, and/or otherwise\r\nprotected from disclosure.

        "communication": "Dear Requestor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your inquiry about the initial response you received from me\r\nto your records request to our School District, and the one you received\r\nfrom the counterpart representative of mine at the Evergreen School\r\nDistrict.  While we are extremely busy with other matters and our School\r\nDistrict has no obligation to dedicate the time or effort necessary to\r\nanswer your inquiry, we\u2019re more than happy to do so on this occasion.\r\nThat\u2019s because it is essential, for successful fulfillment of your request,\r\nto foster the sort of mutually collaborative dialogue with you that I\r\noffered and requested of you in the very same initial response email about\r\nwhich you are inquiring.  In fact, that sort of affirmative collaborative\r\ncommunication is exactly what the regulations under the Washington Public\r\nRecords Act (\u201cPRA\u201d) call for, reciprocally from a requestor such as\r\nyourself and our District, when questions exist \u2013 as they do here, with\r\nyour request \u2013 about just what particular records do and do not need to be\r\nlocated for production, and when \u2013 also as here \u2013 difficulties are\r\npresented by the request as to how to best go about searching to locate all\r\nresponsive records that happen to exist in electronic form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, please accept the following explanation as to why you received like\r\ninitial responses from our School District and the Evergreen School\r\nDistrict and why the same may well be occurring by this email in response\r\nto the inquiry you\u2019ve now made \u2013 and why that, of course, was and is not at\r\nall a matter of coincidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not infrequent that our School District receives a PRA records\r\nrequest that, by its unique nature, volume, and/or ambiguity, prompts us to\r\ndouble-check on the steps we ought to take to make sure we entirely fulfill\r\nall of the obligations we owe the requestor under the PRA.  And in the\r\ncourse of that, it is not at all uncommon that we find it appropriate to\r\nconsult for assistance/advice with PRA resources outside of our office, for\r\nadditional expertise that might supplement our District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d\r\nPRA-processing experience and abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to requests like yours, we and many other school districts\r\nbelieve that outside consultation is in fact a \u201cbest practice.\u201d  Doing so\r\nnot only operates to the benefit of the school district that is in need of\r\nprocessing the request, but just as much to the benefit of the records\r\nrequestor.  In short, that sort of outside-resource consultation enhances\r\nassurances that the requestor will indeed receive an appropriately-timely\r\nand -thorough production of a copy of every reasonably-locatable,\r\nnon-exempt public record that s/he/it seeks, as the end-product of the\r\ndistrict\u2019s execution of search and production steps that were, from the\r\nvery outset, very concertedly designed to assure that the requestor indeed\r\nreceives full performance of all obligations owed her/him/it under public\r\ndisclosure requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I said, many other school districts in our state engage in that same\r\nbest practice, by seeking supplemental PRA assistance from resources\r\noutside their own records-processing staff, to assure they properly process\r\nand fulfill a request like yours.  And sometimes, some of them by\r\nhappenstance coincidentally consult with to the same, common outside\r\nresource for that assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, when two or more school districts have received the same, identical\r\nrequest, and they happen to have consulted with the same external PRA\r\nresource to help assure they give a proper initial response to the request,\r\nit is not a surprise if they happen to \u201cland on the same spot\u201d in\r\ncommunicating their initial responses to the same request/requestor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what happened here.  Since the verbiage, substance, and detail of\r\nyour requests to both our School District and the Evergreen School District\r\nwere and are precisely identical, we and that District were prompted by a\r\nneed to address with you the exact same records-collection, technology,\r\ntime frame, dialogue/clarification, etc., issues with you, via our\r\nrespective initial responses; and by happenstance, we consulted with the\r\nsame outside source for assistance with our respective initial responses,\r\ntoward the aim of best fulfilling your request to your ultimate\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor that same reason, as I stated above, it would not be surprising and\r\nindeed quite that you may well receive this same explanation, virtually\r\nidentically, to the exact same inquiry you\u2019ve now directed to both of our\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, having provided the foregoing, we want to acknowledge and assure you\r\nthat we in no way plan to provide you any sort of a \u201ccookie cutter\u201d\r\napproach to the continuing processing and fulfillment of your request.\r\nThat could not properly occur under the obligations we owe you under the\r\nPRA.  We fully understand that when a records request we\u2019ve received has\r\nalso been identically submitted to another (or more than one other) school\r\ndistrict, at some point \u2013 usually fairly early on \u2013 that request must and\r\nwill be handled differently and uniquely by us, as compared to the\r\ndifferent sort of handling that (or those) other district(s) must and will\r\nneed to dedicate to their proper processing of that same request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s so for virtually innumerable reasons.  Some of those, just by way of\r\nexamples, would be that we are most certainly differently-situated as\r\ncompared to the Evergreen School District to the particular internal\r\nprocesses we have adopted for processing records requests, once we are\r\nassured we know the specific parameters of the scope of records implicated\r\nby the request; we doubtless have differing particularities in the\r\nprotocols we have followed in our paper and electronic records-filing and\r\n-archiving systems, relative to how and where records responsive to the\r\nrequest in likely to be located in our District; comparatively greater or\r\nlesser staffing levels will exist, as between that District and ours, in\r\nterms of the volume and \u201cquality\u201d of human resources we and they have to\r\ndedicate to the processing of your request, particularly in terms of\r\nexperience or expertise levels amongst records-processing staff members as\r\nto unique issues raised by the request; differences in availability of that\r\nstaff to dedicate themselves to working on the request in light of other\r\nhigh-priority duties of theirs that may be more directly necessary to our\r\nrespective Districts\u2019 abilities to fulfill our missions of educating and\r\nprotecting the well-being of the children entrusted to us; the numbers of\r\nemployees outside of our records-processing staffs (e.g.,\r\nadministrators/teachers/others employed in our schools who will need to\r\ndedicate time to assisting in the records-gathering process for the\r\nrequest, and their ability to perform that work while still performing\r\ntheir duties; different levels of experience, technologies, and staff\r\navailability in our respective IT departments who likely will need to work\r\non the request; etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the reasons I\u2019ve stated, the appropriate \u201csameness\u201d of our School\r\nDistrict\u2019s processing of your request, as between ourselves and the\r\nEvergreen School District (or for that matter, as compared to any other\r\nschool district that has received your request) likely will end very\r\nshortly \u2013 indeed we\u2019d expect, upon the occurrence of the requested,\r\ncollaborative dialogue with you on the points that were identified in my\r\ninitial response to you.  So I do look very much look forward to hearing\r\nfrom you so that we can address those points, and we can proceed with the\r\nbenefit of that planned, good discussion in the best possible posture\r\ntoward fulfilling your request in a timely and thorough manner that best\r\nmeets your records and informational needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJill\r\n*Jill Therrien*\r\n*HR Leaves Specialist *\r\n*Mead School District*\r\n*2323 E Farwell Rd.*\r\n*Mead, WA 99021*\r\n*(509) 465-6049 (p)*\r\n*(509) 465-7680 (f)*\r\n\r\nThe information in this email is confidential, privileged, and/or otherwise\r\nprotected from disclosure.

        "communication": "Hello Ms. Therrien,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response.\r\n\r\nI disagree with many of your statements in regards to the District\u2019s legal obligations for compliance with the Washington State Public Records Act. Further, I do not believe your explanation regarding the \u201csameness\u201d of the obviously plagiarized EVERGREEN 11-16-21 email to be offed in good faith. \r\n\r\nPlease note RCW 42.56.030:\r\n\r\n\u2018The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may maintain control over the instruments that they have created. This chapter shall be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed to promote this public policy and to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other act, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.\u2019\r\n\r\nRegardless, the following are responses to your request for \u201cclarification\u201d dated 11-16-2021:\r\n\r\n1. Please address any questions you may have regarding this public records request (PRR) in writing via email.\r\n\r\n2. You stated the District was \u201cuncertain\u201d as to the scope of records requested and you then requested a \u201creasonably specific description\u201d as to the scope of records requested.\r\n\r\nI begin my response below by incorporating the text of the original public records request dated 11-4-2021:\r\n\r\n\u201cI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by Mead School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo further clarify this request: \r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all original PRA requests. If the original PRA request was made via email, I request the NATIVE electronic format to be produced. If the original request was made via US mail or limited to written paper form only, I request an electronic .pdf copy of the original request.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all communications between the District and the PRA requestor regarding the processing and any other aspect of production for the PRR. All communications, requests for clarification and replies are responses by the District and were previously requested in my original request. If the communications between the District and the requestor were via email I request the NATIVE electronic email format to be produced. If the communications between the District and the original requestor were limited to written paper form I request a .pdf copy of any communications.\r\n\r\nI request an electronic copy of all \u201crecords and writings\u201d as defined by RCW 42.56 previously produced by the District in response to the original PRA request. If the District produced electronic files in response to a PRA request, I request a duplicate copy of the files produced. If the District produced paper copies in response to a PRA request, I request a .pdf copy of those paper copies to be produced. \r\n\r\n3. As for keyword searches and the District\u2019s expressed difficulty in locating electronic and paper public records requests over the years, unfortunately I cannot offer guidance other than to suggest the District immediately seek and retain additional expertise that might supplement District\u2019s own \u201cin-house\u201d PRA-processing experience and abilities. This PRR is not for keywords but rather for public records previously produced by the District.\r\n\r\nPlease reference WAC 44-14-04003 (10) Searching for records.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn agency must conduct an objectively reasonable search for responsive records. The adequacy of a search is judged by the standard of reasonableness. A requestor is not required to \"ferret out\" records on his or her own. A reasonable agency search usually begins with the public records officer for the agency or a records coordinator for a department of the agency deciding where the records are likely to be and who is likely to know where they are. One of the most important parts of an adequate search is to decide how wide the search will be. If the agency is small, it might be appropriate to initially ask all agency employees and officials if they have responsive records. If the agency is larger, the agency may choose to initially ask only the staff of the department or departments of an agency most likely to have the records. For example, a request for records showing or discussing payments on a public works project might initially be directed to all staff in the finance and public works departments if those departments are deemed most likely to have the responsive documents, even though other departments may have copies or alternative versions of the same documents. Meanwhile, other departments that may have documents should be instructed to preserve their records in case they are later deemed to be necessary to respond to the request. The agency could notify the requestor which departments are being surveyed for the documents so the requestor may suggest other departments.\r\n\r\nIf agency employees or officials are using home computers, personal devices, or personal accounts to conduct agency business, those devices and accounts also need to be searched by the employees or officials who are using them when those devices and accounts may have responsive records. If an agency's contractors performing agency work have responsive public records of an agency as a consequence of the agency's contract, they should also be notified of the records request. It is better to be over inclusive rather than under inclusive when deciding which staff or others should be contacted, but not everyone in an agency needs to be asked if there is no reason to believe he or she has responsive records. An email to staff or agency officials selected as most likely to have responsive records is usually sufficient. Such an email also allows an agency to document whom it asked for records. Documentation of searches is recommended. The courts can consider the reasonableness of an agency's search when considering assessing penalties for an agency's failure to produce records.\u201d\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

We would like to\r\nnote a couple of items with this first installment. First, it is smaller\r\nthan we had anticipated being able to provide, as we ran into significant\r\ntechnical issues with collecting the records in the Native format as you\r\nrequested. Secondly, we did have to make some additional redactions to one\r\nof the requests we are providing, as the requestor has changed and certain\r\nFERPA exemptions now apply to the records. In order for us to be able to\r\nmake the applicable redactions we have had to provide those records in PDF\r\nform (with the metadata included). We have also provided a withholding log\r\nthat reflects those redactions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, pursuant to RCW 42.56.520, I am hereby notifying you that the\r\nMead School District estimates we will be able to respond more fully to\r\nyour request on or before March 30, 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised of the District's recently updated Policy on providing\r\nrecords, waiver of costs, and agreements regarding costs. The District will\r\ntake reasonable steps to provide the records in the most efficient manner\r\navailable to the District in its normal operations, which will typically be\r\nin electronic format. The following is the District's fee structure for\r\nelectronic records:\r\n\r\n1.  Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format\r\nor for the use of  District equipment to scan the records.\r\n\r\n2.  Five cents per each four electronic files or attachments uploaded to\r\nemail, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\n3.  Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an\r\nelectronic format or for the use of District equipment to send the records\r\nelectronically.\r\n\r\n4.  The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the\r\nDistrict, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the\r\ncopies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe charge for the included installment is so de minimis that it has been\r\nwaived at this time. The possible charge for the remaining records,\r\nhowever, likely will not be so de minimis that we could waive charges. So,\r\nplease be prepared that we likely will be asking that you pre-pay before\r\nwe'll be able to provide you with future installments.\r\n\r\nThe Public Records Officer or designee may require a deposit of up to ten\r\npercent of the estimated costs of copying all the records selected by the\r\nrequestor, including the cost of a customized service charge according to\r\nthe provision. If the requestor fails to pay a deposit or final payment for\r\nthe requested copies, the Public Records Officer will close the request and\r\nindicate to the requestor that the District has closed the request.\r\n\r\nIf requested, the District will provide a summary of the applicable charges\r\nbefore charges are imposed under this procedure. The requestor will be\r\nallowed to revise the request in order to reduce the applicable charges.\r\n\r\nThe following links provide more detailed information regarding the\r\nDistrict's Public Records Policy\r\n<https://www.mead354.org/ourpages/Board-Policies//Series%204000%20-%20Community%20Relations/4040_Policy_-_Public_Access_to_District_Records.pdf>\r\n and Procedure\r\n<https://www.mead354.org/ourpages/Board-Policies//Series%204000%20-%20Community%20Relations/4040_Procedure_-_Public_Access_to_District_Records.pdf>\r\n.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJill\r\n*Jill Therrien*\r\n*HR Leaves Specialist *\r\n*Mead School District*\r\n*2323 E Farwell Rd.*\r\n*Mead, WA 99021*\r\n*(509) 465-6049 (p)*\r\n*(509) 465-7680 (f)*\r\n\r\nThe information in this email is confidential, privileged, and/or otherwise\r\nprotected from disclosure.

Records to be produced in reverse\r\nchronological order - from the most recent records to the earliest. If\r\nrequest is denied in whole or part, provide detailed contemporaneous log\r\nfor any document withheld or redacted. For each record the District\r\ncontends is exempt from public disclosure in whole or part, specifically\r\nidentify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and\r\nstate how specific statutory exemption applies to each record required by\r\nRCW. 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing ass'n v.

This request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\nRequested documents will be made available to the general public. *\r\n\r\nWe have the next installment to produce to you. This email outlines the\r\ncost associated with producing those records and instructs you on payment\r\nof those costs.  Pursuant to RCW 42.56.120 and Mead School District\r\nProcedure 4040, the District may impose a fee for providing copies of\r\npublic records. To date, we have gathered emails responsive to the portions\r\nof your request listed above. The responsive records consist of 653 scanned\r\nitems. The District may charge $.10 per page for public records scanned\r\ninto electronic format, that comes to $65.30.  This exceeds the amount\r\nwhere the District would consider waiving the charge.\r\n\r\n*You may make the $65.30 payment by mailing cash, check, or money order\r\nmade payable to \u201cMead School District,\u201d addressed to me as follows:*\r\n\r\n*Monique Palm*\r\n\r\n\r\n*Mead School District*\r\n\r\n*Attn: Public Records Fees*\r\n\r\n*2323 E Farwell Rd*\r\n\r\n*Mead, WA 99021*\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may make that payment in person at our District Office\r\nat the same address on any non-holiday weekday.

Once we receive payment, we will disclose the\r\nrecords responsive to the portions of your request listed above.  Please be\r\nadvised that we are required to allow you a thirty-day time frame to make\r\nthe pre-payment as outlined above, measured from the date of this email. A\r\nfailure to receive such payment from a requester within that time frame\r\npermits us to consider their request abandoned and close it.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions or concerns about the foregoing or any other\r\naspect of the processing of your request as we work towards fulfilling it,\r\nplease do not hesitate to let me know.\nThank you,\r\n*Monique Palm*\r\nPublic Records Specialist\r\nMead School District\r\nwww.mead354.org\r\n(509) 465-6076\r\n[image: Mead School district logo]",

Actually no. At least not until your agency publicly follows the law.\r\n\r\nIn fact, your agency may only charge actual costs incurred for producing public records, and then only after adopting a statement of costs including the factors and manner used to determine the actual costs, and following all that only after providing public notice and public hearing.\r\n\r\n\"RCW 42.56.070 Documents and indexes to be made public\u2014Statement of costs.(7) \r\n\r\nEach agency may establish, maintain, and make available for public inspection and copying a statement of the actual costs that it charges for providing photocopies or electronically produced copies, of public records and a statement of the factors and manner used to determine the actual costs. Any statement of costs may be adopted by an agency only after providing notice and public hearing.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, any statement of costs and/or any fee schedule adopted by your agency must of course be publicly published. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(a).\r\n\r\nYour agency had no published fee schedule in place at the time of this public records request in November 2021.\r\n\r\nOf course, your agency may not be required to calculate the actual costs it charges for providing public records if your agency has published rules or regulations declaring the reasons for doing so would be unduly burdensome. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(b).\r\n\r\nHowever your agency public policy in place during November 2021 did not declare that calculating actual costs  would be unduly burdensome. Your new agency policy dated January 24, 2022 also does not declare the reason for not calculating actual costs for public records fees.\r\n\r\nPut simply, your agency cannot adopt a fee schedule of any kind without calculating actual costs. You can't make it up as you go along. \r\n\r\nI would suggest your agency waive fees for all public records requests (including this one) until such time as you can do so legally.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a copy of all fee schedules and statements of costs for public records fees your agency had in place in November of 2021.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

        "communication": "Good evening, \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Lubbock Central Appraisal District received your public information request for \u201cA copy of records/correspondence/related to how the decision to increase property tax values in Lubbock County this year was reached.\u201d  The District has over 160,000 property accounts.  Each year the District must assign an appraised value to each of these accounts.  In addition, there are many different types of properties, and they are not necessarily appraised in the same manner.  Therefore, a request for records and correspondence related to the yearly appraisal is very broad.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you could clarify or narrow this request, it would assist the District in responding and reduce the time necessary to fulfill the request, as well as the charges that may be made under the Public Information Act.  For example, you could narrow or clarify this request by being more specific about the types of records you request.  Alternatively, you could narrow the request to a certain type of property, such as single-family homes or hotels.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFurther, some of the information you are requesting is confidential as a matter of law. Unless you remove confidential information from your request, we will need to request a decision of the Attorney General about the withholding of this information, further delaying a response. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease consider this a request to clarify or narrow your request.  Pursuant to Section 552.222(d) of the Texas Government Code, your request will be considered automatically withdrawn if we do not receive a written response from you within sixty-one (61) days from the date of this email.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMonica Buescher\r\n\r\nPublic Information Coordinator\r\n\r\nCommunication/Procedures Administrator \r\n\r\nLubbock Central Appraisal District\r\n\r\n <mailto:piarequest@lubbockcad.org> piarequest@lubbockcad.org\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSec. 552.222.  PERMISSIBLE INQUIRY BY GOVERNMENTAL BODY TO REQUESTOR.  (a)  The officer for public information and the officer's agent may not make an inquiry of a requestor except to establish proper identification or except as provided by Subsection (b), (c), or (c-1).\r\n\r\n(b)  If what information is requested is unclear to the governmental body, the governmental body may ask the requestor to clarify the request.  If a large amount of information has been requested, the governmental body may discuss with the requestor how the scope of a request might be narrowed, but the governmental body may not inquire into the purpose for which information will be used.\r\n\r\n(c)  If the information requested relates to a motor vehicle record, the officer for public information or the officer's agent may require the requestor to provide additional identifying information sufficient for the officer or the officer's agent to determine whether the requestor is eligible to receive the information under Chapter 730 <https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=730> , Transportation Code.  In this subsection, \"motor vehicle record\" has the meaning assigned that term by Section  <https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=730.003> 730.003, Transportation Code.\r\n\r\n(c-1)  If the information requested includes a photograph described by Section 552.155 <https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.155> (a), the officer for public information or the officer's agent may require the requestor to provide additional information sufficient for the officer or the officer's agent to determine whether the requestor is eligible to receive the information under Section 552.155 <https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.155> (b).\r\n\r\n(d)  If by the 61st day after the date a governmental body sends a written request for clarification or discussion under Subsection (b) or an officer for public information or agent sends a  written request for additional information under Subsection (c) the governmental body, officer for public information, or agent, as applicable, does not receive a written response from the requestor, the underlying request for public information is considered to have been withdrawn by the requestor.\r\n\r\n(e)  A written request for clarification or discussion under Subsection (b) or a written request for additional information under Subsection (c) must include a statement as to the consequences of the failure by the requestor to timely respond to the request for clarification, discussion, or additional information.\r\n\r\n(f)  Except as provided by Subsection (g), if the requestor's request for public information included the requestor's physical or mailing address, the request may not be considered to have been withdrawn under Subsection (d) unless the governmental body, officer for public information, or agent, as applicable, sends the request for clarification or discussion under Subsection (b) or the written request for additional information under Subsection (c) to that address by certified mail.\r\n\r\n(g)  If the requestor's request for public information was sent by electronic mail, the request may be considered to have been withdrawn under Subsection (d) if:\r\n\r\n     (1)  the governmental body, officer for public information, or agent, as applicable, sends the request for clarification or discussion under Subsection (b) or the written request for additional information under Subsection (c) by electronic mail to the same electronic mail address from which the original request was sent or to another electronic mail address provided by the requestor; and\r\n\r\n     (2)  the governmental body, officer for public information, or agent, as applicable, does not receive from the requestor a written response or response by electronic mail within the period described by Subsection (d).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdded by Acts 1993, 73rd Leg., ch. 268, Sec. 1, eff.

We are in the process of analyzing the request.\r\n\r\nOIG gives public records requests high priority and provides requested records as soon as practicable and without delay. A reasonable time for response to a specific public record request depends on the nature of the request, the staff and other resources available to process the request, the extent of the request, and whether confidential material contained in the responsive records must be redacted.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(3), the Department may charge for locating records if the cost is $50 or more, as well as the costs of copies or scanning and mailing/shipping the records responsive to the request. We will prepare an estimate for the cost of the requested documents, if any, and will submit an invoice to you before compiling the records. Also, under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(3)(f), OIG will require prepayment of the estimated cost of providing a copy of the records to you if the total cost exceeds $5.\r\n\r\nYou may direct any questions concerning this request to dhsoigopenrecordsrequest@wi.gov<mailto:dhsoigopenrecordsrequest@wi.gov>.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnthony J.

The Sherriff\u2019s Office provided me with the incident number 2107220284/case number 21015344 and incident number 2301220136/case number 23001556. If you have any additional case numbers or information, let me know.\r\n\r\nFirst we have to see from the law enforcement agency if we are authorized to release the audio. If we are authorized to release it, we will have your request done as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWe are bound by Florida State Statute Section 365.171(12)(a) and 401.30 to redact certain information from 911 calls. Section 365.171(12)(a), F.S., provides that any record, recording, or information, or portions thereof, obtained by a public agency for the purpose of providing services in an emergency which reveals the name, address, or telephone number or personal information about, or information which may identify any person requesting emergency service or reporting an emergency by accessing an emergency communications E911 system is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1), F.S.  Additionally, under 401.30, records of emergency calls which contain patient examination or treatment information are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and may not be disclosed without the consent of the person to whom they pertain, but appropriate limited disclosure may be made without such consent to the person\u2019s guardian, to the next of kin if the person is deceased, or to a parent if the person is a minor.\r\n\r\nOnce your request is complete, we could email over an invoice. You could be charged for labor at a rate of $29.94 an hour if the request takes longer than 30 minutes to pull the audio. We will let you know if it reaches that point. As long as the audio is redacted, the audio file is small enough to be attached to an email and there isn't a labor charge we must receive payment for first, we can send it over email as soon as your request is complete, free of charge. If you prefer the audio be burnt onto a CD, the cost will be $0.30 for the CD and $1.76 for postage if mailed. We accept cash and checks.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMarisa\n",

        "communication": "To whom it may concern:\r\n\r\nThis is a Freedom of Information Act appeal regarding FOIA request No. 2020-03749.\r\n\r\nI. The Request\r\n\r\nOn May 4, 2020, Reason Magazine reporter C.J. Ciaramella submitted a FOIA request to the Bureau of Prisons (hereafter \u201cBOP\u201d) seeking \u201cany mortality reviews conducted regarding inmate deaths at FMC Carswell between Jan. 1, 2015 and May 4, 2020\u201d and \u201cany mortality reviews conducted regarding inmate deaths at FCI Aliceville between Jan. 1, 2015 and May 4, 2020.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe request was received and assigned tracking number 2020-03749. On March 30, 2022 the BOP issued a final response, releasing 288 pages, 84 of which were withheld in part under the following exemptions: (b)(5), (b)(6), and (b)(7)(C).\r\n\r\nII. The argument\r\n\r\nA. BOP did not respond to the request for records concerning FCI Aliceville\r\n\r\nBOP\u2019s final response (see attached) misstates the original request, mentioning only the request for records from FMC Carswell but not FCI Aliceville. Please inform the requester if there are responsive records from Aliceville or conduct the required search.\r\n\r\nB. BOP has not satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the responsive documents are exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5.\r\n\r\nInformation redacted from the multi-level mortality review reports under (b)(5) includes the review committee\u2019s findings on the timeliness and appropriateness of diagnostic and treatment regimens; problems encountered during the medical emergency, such as transportation and communication; whether there was adequate documentation in the patient\u2019s medical files; and whether the patient received appropriate and adequate medical care per BOP\u2019s policies. Also withheld were the committee\u2019s findings regarding the strengths and weaknesses of care delivered, and recommendations for improving future care under BOP's policies.\r\n\r\nTo qualify for FOIA\u2019s deliberative process privilege, an agency must demonstrate, not simply declare, that the withheld documents are both \u201cpre-decisional\u201d and \u201cdeliberative.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 141, 151 (D.C. Cir. 2006). A document is pre-decisional if it was \u201cgenerated before the adoption of an agency policy\u201d and deliberative if it reflects the \u201cgive-and-take of the consultative process.\u201d Id. The privilege does not protect material that is \u201cpurely factual\u201d or \u201can agency\u2019s final opinions, statements or policy and interpretations definitively adopted by the agency, and any document having \u2018the force and effect of law.\u2019\u201d Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. U.S. Forest Serv., 861 F.2d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir. 1988). Nor does the privilege shield records that merely describe or explain decisions that have already been made. E.g., Taxation With Representation Fund, Inc. v. IRS, 646 F.2d 666, 677-78 (D.C. Cir. 1981). \r\n\r\nCourts regularly order agencies to disclose final assessments of their performance under existing policy, even if officials might someday draw on those evaluations in future policy decisions. See, e.g., Cowdery, Ecker & Murphy, L.L.C. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, 511 F. Supp. 2d 215, 221 (D. Conn. 2007) (requiring an agency to disclose an employee\u2019s \u201cself-assessment and his supervisor\u2019s recommendations and assessment of his performance\u201d because they were not \u201cdeliberations or recommendations on Department policy\u201d); Chicago Tribune Co. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., No. 95-C-3917, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2308 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 26, 1997) (requiring disclosure of factual assessments by agency auditors reviewing an outside study). \r\n\r\nThe multi-level mortality review reports at issue are created as a matter of routine in the event of any death in BOP custody. The reports constitute conclusions and facts found by the review committee regarding compliance with BOP policy, but they are not in any way related to the shaping or drafting of those policies. Because the withheld information was created independent of any particular legal or policy matter, and because it concerns BOP\u2019s compliance with existing policies,  the records are neither predecisional nor deliberative. BOP\u2019s withholding is erroneous because it applies Exemption 5\u2019s deliberative process privilege to final, objective assessments of the agency\u2019s compliance with existing policy in a manner that is contrary to settled law.\r\n\r\n***\r\nFor the reasons above, the requester respectfully requests that the BOP produce the withheld portions of the reports, fulfill the request for similar records from FCI Aliceville or inform the requester that no responsive records were located, and respond to this appeal within 20 days. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this appeal, please contact me directly at 503-951-9863.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nCJ Ciaramella",

A review of your request has determined the following:\r\n\r\nThe request is presently awaiting assignment to a Disclosure analyst who will then review the records to determine if any redactions are required pursuant to subsections of Title 5, U. S. Code, Section 552 and 552a.\r\n\r\nYou may check the status of your request online at http://vault.fbi.gov by clicking on the 'Check Status of Your FOI/PA Request' link.  Online status reports are updated weekly.\r\n\r\nRequests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium, large, and extra-large sub-tracks based upon request size.  Simple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  Currently, simple track cases average approximately 115 days from the date of receipt for processing.  Our complex requests in the medium processing track are currently averaging 653 days, large processing track are currently averaging approximately 1,432 days, and extra-large processing track are currently averaging 2,008 days for processing.\r\n\r\nYour request is currently in the complex request medium processing track, and the estimated date of completion for your request is July 2021.  If your request is considered a complex track, considering reducing the scope of your request may accelerate the process as it could potentially place your request in a quicker processing track.  This may also reduce any search and duplication costs, if applicable, and allow for a more timely receipt of your information.  If you wish to discuss reducing the scope of your request, please indicate so and a representative will be in contact.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Information Officer\r\nRecord/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) FBI-Information Management Division\r\n170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602-4843\r\nDirect: (540) 868-4593\r\nFax: (540) 868-4391\r\nQuestions E-mail: foipaquestions@fbi.gov<mailto:foipaquestions@fbi.gov>\r\n\r\nDo you have further questions about the FOI/PA process?

Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).

State and local agencies that spent less than $100,000 may voluntarily submit reports (RCW 40.14.026(5)).\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (JLARC) report submitted by your agency to JLARC for the year 2021.

The most recent public records should be produced first. \r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\nPlease provide all electronic records in their native electronic format. Please do not create new records by printing native electronic files then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints for electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\nThis public records request is being made via email.

Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03001 - \"Public record\" defined.\r\n\r\nFor most public records, the act uses a three-part test to determine if a record is a \"public record.\" The document must be: A \"writing,\" containing information \"relating to the conduct of government\" or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function, \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency.\r\n(1) Writing. A \"public record\" can be any writing \"regardless of physical form or characteristics.\" RCW 42.56.010(3). \"Writing\" is defined very broadly as: \"\u2026 handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\" RCW 42.56.010(4). An email, text, social media posting and database are therefore also \"writings.\"\r\n(2) Relating to the conduct of government. To be a \"public record,\" a document must relate to the \"conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function.\" RCW 42.56.010(3).1 Almost all records held by an agency relate to the conduct of government.\r\n(3) \"Prepared, owned, used, or retained.\" A \"public record\" is a record \"prepared, owned, used, or retained\" by an agency. RCW 42.56.010(3).\r\nA record can be \"used\" by an agency even if the agency does not actually possess the record. If an agency uses a record in its decision-making process it is a \"public record.\"4 For example, if an agency considered technical specifications of a public works project and returned the specifications to the contractor in another state, the specifications would be a \"public record\" because the agency \"used\" the document in its decision-making process.5 The agency could be required to obtain the public record, unless doing so would be impossible. An agency cannot send its only copy of a public record to a third party for the sole purpose of avoiding disclosure.\r\nSometimes agency employees or officials may work on agency business from home computers or on other personal devices, or from nonagency accounts (such as a nonagency email account), creating and storing agency records on those devices or in those accounts. When the records are prepared, owned, used or retained within the scope of the employee's or official's employment, those records (including emails, texts and other records) were \"used\" by the agency and relate to the \"conduct of government\" so they are \"public records.\"7 RCW 42.56.010(3). Agencies should instruct employees and officials that all public records, regardless of where they were created, should eventually be stored on agency computers. Agencies should ask employees and officials to keep agency-related documents with any retention requirements on home computers or personal devices in separate folders temporarily, until they are provided to the agency. An agency could also require an employee or official to routinely blind carbon copy (\"bcc\") work emails in a personal account back to an agency email account. If the agency receives a request for records that are located solely on employees' or officials' home computers or personal devices, or in personal accounts, the agency should direct the individual to search for and provide any responsive documents to the agency, and the agency should process the request as it would if the records were on the agency's computers or in agency-owned devices or accounts. The agency employee or official may be required by the agency to sign an affidavit describing the nature and extent of his or her search for and production of responsive public records located on a home computer or personal device, or in a nonagency account, and a description of personal records not provided with sufficient facts to show the records are not public records.",

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the Internet Archive and MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my research is not limited to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and attitudes of the government itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of this particular subject in advance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the released information to a broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.3d 807, 814-15 (2d Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and national security policy.\" Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the nature of the requester, not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a representative of the news media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a representative of the news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which he or she is requesting information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the purposes of determining the appropriate fee category.\r\n\r\nAs my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting on it and making the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEmma Best\n\n",

        "communication": "Good Morning Ms. Best ,\r\n\r\nWe're contacting you about the FOIPA request made for records concerning Financial News Network.  The FBI located approximately 7,015 pages potentially responsive to your request.  Requests are processed in the order in which they are received through our multi-track processing system, and the FBI receives a voluminous amount of requests on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Requests are divided into two primary tracks--simple (under 50 pages of potentially responsive documents) and complex (over 50 pages of potentially responsive documents).  Complex requests are further divided into medium (51-950 pages), large (951-8000 pages), and extra-large (over 8000 pages) sub-tracks based upon request size. \r\n\r\nSimple track requests typically require the least amount of time to process.  The more potentially responsive pages a request has, the more complex it becomes, greatly increasing the time required for processing.  Generally, the larger the file, the longer it takes to process.  A review of your request determined that it is currently in the complex request large processing track.  Given our current workload and staffing levels, it may yet be a long time before you begin to receive material from this request.  \r\n\r\nReducing the scope of your request may accelerate the processing and allow for a more timely receipt of the information you seek, as it could potentially place your request into a smaller, faster processing track.  Would you be willing to consider reducing the scope of your request?  If so, we would be happy to help you to decide the best approach to take.  If you are looking for something specific, we could approach the scope reduction process in that way.\r\n\r\nThe current average time to complete a large track request is approximately 56 months. \r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to potentially reduce the scope of your request.  If you reduce the size, you can request the additional records with a new FOIA request upon completion of this one.\r\n\r\nWe can be reached via email at fbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov, or you may call 540-868-4894.  We appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegotiation Team\r\nFOIA Support Unit\r\nFBI Information Management Division\r\nFbi.foipa.negotiation@fbi.gov\r\n540-868-4894",
