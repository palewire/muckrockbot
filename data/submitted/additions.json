With regard to agencies that have submitted probe photos, please provide logs, lists or datasets describing, as available, the requesting organization, the number of requests made, the dates of the requests, and the number of requests granted.  If this information is maintained in a spreadsheet, such as Excel, I request that the record be produced in this format.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPaul Tepper",
