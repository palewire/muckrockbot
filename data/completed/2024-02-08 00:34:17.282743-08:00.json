        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\n\r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\n\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\n\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nB3. The aggregate number of \"detections\" from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period. For example, most Flock Safety systems may not have this data beyond 30 days. \r\n\r\nB4.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d from January 1, 2024 until the date this request is processed. If your agency has a retention period shorter than 1 year, please provide whatever data is available based on your retention period.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B4 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPlease note that more than 80 California law enforcement agencies have provided the information requested in Parts A1-A4 and B1-B4 in previous years. For your reference we have included a table (attached) with the names of the agencies that have historically provided these records. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n \r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at ALPR@eff.org. \r\n                                          \t \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJennifer Pinsof\r\nStaff Attorney \r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Your request mentioned: Eviction List from January 2019 to Present The Department is reviewing your Public Records Act request dated December 22, 2023, and received by the department via regular mail on January 3, 2024. The Department does not have a record of ever receiving an \u201coriginal\u201d Public Records Act request allegedly submitted to the Department on April 22, 2022. The records you have requested require the Department to search for, collect, and examine large amounts of records over a lengthy period of time.\u00a0 In addition, some of these records requested may be exempt from disclosure under applicable privileges and or disclosure exemptions. \u00a0Some of these documents may require legal review and redaction. Accordingly, the Department will be unable to make a final determination of whether your request seeks access/copies of disclosable public records in the possession of the County within 10 days of receiving your request.\u00a0 The Department will provide a response to your request pursuant to Government Code section 6253(c) no later than 24 days after receiving your request. The Department anticipates that due to the size of your request, we will have a need to release any responsive records on a rolling basis. The Department\u2019s method of releasing such responsive records is through our online Public Records Act portal \"GovQA\" located at https://siskiyoucountyca.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/CustomerIssues.aspx.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, M. G. L.c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth):\r\n1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc. Charge (or charges)\r\nd. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and\r\nl. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n3. Please provide an unduplicated count of arrested students for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n4. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year. For each referral to law enforcement, please include the school, demographic, and incident information described in DESE\u2019s School Safety and Discipline Report Data Handbook v. 20.0.\r\n5. Please also provide an unduplicated counts of referrals to law enforcement (as defined above) for each school year including 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced).\r\n6. A copy of any active memorandum of agreement and/or standard operating procedures between your police department and local school districts regarding police placement or activity in schools.\r\n7. A copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school; and,\r\n8. Any records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing, data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with M. G. L.c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act. \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your police department may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty. Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n\r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. M. G. L.c 66, \u00a7 6A(d).\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply. To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJoseph Steinbach\r\nResearch Assistant\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoseph Steinbach",

This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department. \r\n\r\nFor your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist. \r\n\r\nYou may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request.

I will return to this below.\r\n\r\nThere is one column that entirely lacks description. Many cells aren't even correctly formatted.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the columns have only the most minimal descriptions, which makes the data substantially less meaningful.

I see no such information in the response.\r\n\r\nI had requested \"Records relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have installed MERV 13 filters.\" I see no such *specific* information, but it's possible that one of those four columns is a partial response.\r\n\r\nI had requested \"Records relating to the total \r\nnumber of inspected restaurants that have installed portable filtration or UVGI instead of MERV 13 filters. \" I see no such *specific* information, but it's possible that one of those four columns is a partial response.\r\n\r\nI had requested \"Records relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that were operating the installed filtration or UVGI systems when inspected. \" I see no such *specific* information, but it's possible that one of those four columns is a partial response.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had requested \"Records relating to the total number of inspected restaurants that have other mitigation measures in place, when MERV 13 filtration, UVGI, and portable filtration, was not in place. \" I see no such *specific* information, but it's possible that columns provided contain partially responsive information, that I may be able to use to construct an answer. I do not see why this would be up to me, it would require parsing into a structured data format from the human readable PDF you've provided, you should absolutely be able to summarize the strongly typed columns in your database.\r\n\r\nI had requested \"Records relating to the number restaurants that have been found to be or are currently out of compliance with air filtration and ventilating guidance.\" I see no such *specific* information, but it's possible that columns provided contain partially responsive information, that I may be able to use to construct an answer. I do not see why this would be up to me, it would require parsing into a structured data format from the human readable PDF you've provided, you should absolutely be able to summarize the strongly typed columns in your database.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second paragraph in your response letter contains the following sentence: \"Please note that some records have been redacted pursuant to Public Officer\u2019s Law \u00a7 87(2)(b) and (g). \"\r\n\r\nThis is highly concerning for multiple reasons. For one, I have received only one page, there appears to have been a blanket withholding of records instead of mere redaction.\r\n\r\nPlease clearly articulate the content and volume of records withheld. Please provide a particularized and specific justification for wholesale withholding. An agency cannot refuse to produce a whole record simply because some of it may be exempt from disclosure; agency must make a reasonable effort to determine which parts it has authority to redact.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the first of the claims of redaction pertain to this section in the law:\r\n\"(b) if disclosed would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under the provisions of subdivision two of section eighty-nine of this article;\"\r\n\r\nHave I correctly identified the relevant text in the statue?\r\n\r\nIt is unclear to me how my request is invasive to anybody's personal privacy - it pertains only to the operation of businesses who serve the public. Please provide a particularized and specific justification for this redaction, and explain how much information was redacted. An agency cannot refuse to produce a whole record simply because some of it may be exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, you also claim a redaction under the clause \"g\" of the same law. I believe this is the following section of the law:\r\n(g) are inter-agency or intra-agency materials which are not:\r\n\r\ni. statistical or factual tabulations or data;\r\n\r\nii. instructions to staff that affect the public;\r\n\r\niii. final agency policy or determinations;\r\n\r\niv. external audits, including but not limited to audits performed by\r\nthe comptroller and the federal government; or\r\n\r\nInsofar as records appear to have been withheld wholesale, I cannot even tell which agencies are involved here.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the single page of disclosure appears to indicate employees from every agency as diverse as The Department of Transportation and The Taxi and Limousine Commission were assigned to what is essentially an assignment that combines occupation safety and health engineering with public health. My good faith presumption is that this was an attempt to muster adequate staff in a time of emergency, but it would be unreasonable to allow this to be used to construct a new administrative structure from multiple employees from different agencies assigned to work under a common office that is further shielded or otherwise obfuscated from public view under the provisions of FOIL.\r\n\r\nMost specifically, considering I requested, specifically, \"statistical or factual tabulations or data\", I'm confused by this reference.\r\n\r\nWith regards to \"instructions to staff that affect the public;\", I cannot emphasize enough how much this affects the public. At least one out of every 283 residents statewide have died as a result of a catastrophic pandemic that's swept across our city several times over the past 3.5 years. These deaths were the direct result of exposure to a pathogen that is predominantly spread through the air, an airborne virus, in aerosols. I cannot propose any greater outcome that may be affected on a member of the public than literal death.\r\n\r\nAny instruction that was provided to any employee of the city as part of the restaurant reopening plan had an inherent and indisputable role to play in whether the public inhaled an infectious disease at locations covered by the restaurant reopening plan. Indeed, unlike other indoor spaces, engineering controls like air filtration and ventilation are often the *only* measure that can play a role where people are eating.\r\n\r\nIndeed, elected officials made pronouncements of widespread compliance with these measures, FOIL exists in part to allow members of the public to verify these claims by reducing the information asymmetry inherently present in the public/government dynamic.\r\n\r\nWith regards to \"final agency policy or determinations\", I imagine choices as to what conditions are considered as a \"yes\" or a \"no\" compliance are considered final policy, since it determines penalties and other enforcement actions, which cannot be levied based on draft policy or determinations.\r\n\r\nSince you did not specify which of the exact four clauses, please clarify if withholding/redaction was related to \"external audits, including but not limited to audits performed bythe comptroller and the federal government; or\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the last clause in your comments about the records returned was \"You may wish to direct your search to the New York City Office of Technology and Innovation\".\r\n\r\nPlease elaborate on this. On 09/20/2021, in response to a FOIL request to DOHMH, I received the following from an employee of DOHMH:\r\n\r\n\"I apologize for the delay. Please note that out of the limited data DOHMH has which would be responsive to your Freedom of Information Law request (data on the number of restaurants found to be out of compliance with air filtration requirements), this number would not accurately reflect the number of restaurants with violations, because the data does not contain citywide business inspections results.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that City Hall is in possession of the complete universe of this data, and is in a best equipped to respond to your request.\"\r\n\r\nHad the OOM responded within a more reasonable time to this request (it's been two years), I would be more willing to submit a request to OTI before asking: please elaborate on what data they may have that you do not? I am presuming good faith and a helpful suggestion here, but the delays in city FOIL administration are such that I might expect knowledgeable employees and other figures to die of old age before addressing my request. I'd love to know more before running off and chasing that agency down.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is unclear to me why only data for 60 or so restaurants might be in possession of OOM, but not\u2026 all the others.",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B2 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your agency provided substantially similar data in 2022. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Your request was received in this office on August 15, 2023 with the\r\nassigned control number 24-19722.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, you seek documents related to the murder of the Reverend\r\nWillie G. Lee in Belzoni, Mississippi on May 7, 1955.\r\n\r\nWe searched in Record Group 60, General Records of the Department of\r\nJustice. Specifically, we searched in the Department of\r\nJustice General Index to Litigation Files\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1882794> (Entry A1 110-A) and found a\r\ncard responsive\r\nto your request regarding Willie G. Lee with the assigned Case File #\r\n144-41-210 . However, the files are subject to *access restrictions* and\r\nneed to be reviewed for categories of information exempted from disclosure\r\nunder the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). I have included  our\r\nSpecial Access/FOIA Office (specialaccess_foia@nara.gov) on this email to\r\nreview the records and to conduct a search for additional FBI records. They\r\nwill respond separately to your request.. Here is the citation for your\r\nreference:\r\n\r\n*Record Group 60*\r\n*General Records of the Department of Justice*\r\n\r\n*Class 144 (Civil Rights) Litigation Case Files*\r\n*Entry A1-COR 144*\r\n*Box 2992@ B190/26/23/6*\r\n\r\nWe have also identified additional case file numbers 144-41-210 and\r\n144-40-2154 that were responsive to your request. However, they are not in\r\nthe custody of the National Archives. If you wish to access them you will\r\nneed to file a FOIA request directly with the Department of Justice. You\r\nmay submit your request at  <http://goog_538679821/>\r\nhttps://www.justice.gov/oip/make-foia-request-doj\r\n\r\nWe have also searched in the Index Cards to Classification 44 (Civil\r\nRights) Headquarters Case Files, 1923-1972\r\n<https://catalog.archives.gov/id/2387379> for any reference to a case file\r\nfor Willie G. Lee but there were no responsive results.\r\n\r\nWe do not consider this a denial of your FOIA request. However, if you are\r\nnot satisfied with our action on this request, your options for appeal and\r\ndispute resolution are outlined in the attached enclosure. If you have any\r\nquestions, you may reach us at archives2reference@nara.gov.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis completes the processing of your request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael J.

For instance, if Shotspotter was implemented in the city on January 1, 2008, I would like all Shotspotter data from this date to December 31st, 2020. The list/database should include, where possible, the date, time, location (address or latitude+longitude coordinates), single or multiple shot distinction, whether the shots were confirmed, police district located, and associated case number for each alert.\r\n2) Any document that provides information on the procedure for how  the police department should respond to Shotspotter alerts. In particular, I am looking for a document that describes how the police will react to a Shotspotter alert. For instance, if an alert is created, are police dispatched?\r\n3) Shotspotter rollout dates. If the police department rolled out the Shotspotter data by police district, please include the implementation dates attached to each police district.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Topper",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

Seven months of repeated delays are unreasonable given the narrow scope of the request. Considering similar requests I've had fulfilled by SCOC, I anticipate this one to result in well under 100 pages of mostly boilerplate releasable records.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, SCOC is required by law to, within 10 business days, provide specific reasons why this request cannot be fulfilled, or else must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by \r\nthe specific date given beyond 20 business days, or if the specific date given is  unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied. In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with Public Officers Law \u00a789.4(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing  such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the  person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who  shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d \r\n\r\nI am requesting that you either fulfill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nChris Gelardi",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Welsh:\r\n\r\n\"On June 6, 2023, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) office received your FOIA request dated June 6, 2023, and assigned it control number DOI-USGS-2023-004942.  Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request.  You request the following information:\r\n\r\nI am requesting images and video recorded in drone flyovers of prescribed burns in \"USGS (Wetland Aquatic Research Center)\" and \"USGS Wetland Aquatic Research Center Lafayette LA\" on January 26, 2023.\r\n\r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the \u201cnews media\u201d requester.  As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.49(a)(1).  You can expect to hear from us promptly regarding the outcome of this search.\r\n\r\nYou have agreed to pay up to $200.00 for the processing of your request.  If we find that this will not cover the cost of processing your request, we will stop processing your request at the point this amount has been reached and will let you know before we incur additional charges.  You can then either agree to pay the additional amount needed or narrow the scope of your request.\r\n\r\nWe use Multitrack Processing to process FOIA requests.  The Simple track is for requests that would generally take one to five workdays to process.  The Normal track is for requests that would generally take six to twenty workdays to process.  The Complex track is for requests that would generally take twenty-one to sixty workdays to process.  The Extraordinary track is for requests that would generally take more than sixty workdays to process.  The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing, which are processed as soon as practicable.  Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the Normal processing track.  There are 15 requests pending ahead of yours in our overall processing queue.  Presuming that our current FOIA capacity and burden remain constant, we expect that we will dispatch a determination to you by July 10, 2023.\r\n\r\nYou may narrow the scope of your request to obtain quicker processing in your currently-assigned track or move the request into a different track, which may enable us to process it more quickly by communicating with us at foia@usgs.gov.\r\n\r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.  Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation.  You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:            \r\n\r\nOffice of Government Information Services\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n\r\n8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS\r\n\r\nCollege Park, MD  20740-6001\r\n\r\nTelephone:  (202) 741-5770\r\n\r\nFax:  (202) 741-5769\r\n\r\nToll-free:  1 (877) 684-6448\r\n\r\nE-mail:  ogis@nara.gov\r\n\r\nWeb: https://www.archives.gov/ogis\r\n\r\nPlease note that using OGIS services does not affect the timing of an appeal with the Department\u2019s FOIA & Privacy Act Appeals Officer.

Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wa.2d 863 (2015).\r\n\r\nWith respect to requests for records that include \"Writings\" per 42.56.010(4) this means handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nThis request specifically includes - and the District is specifically directed to obtain, preserve in native format, and produce - any records pertaining to public business that exist on any computers, hard drives, portable phones, jump drives, BlackBerries, iPhone, Kindle, IPad, or other devices, or in email, data, voice mail, or text mail accounts owned, controlled or paid for, directly or indirectly, by any agency or 3rd party. \r\n\r\nIn the event the District chooses to provide the records in installments over time I request the records to be produced in reverse chronological order - from the most recent to the earliest.\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the PRA. I also request  a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nFor emails I request production of emails in native MICROSOFT .pst (personal storage table) format which allows for a virtually infinite number of emails to be produced in a single digital file, providing for economy and convenience. If the .pst format is not available, I would request production of email in .pdf (portable document format) another widely accepted format for email production providing similar economy and convenience of a virtually infinite number emails bundled  into a single digital .pdf file. \r\n\r\nI request records production by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link if available or USB DRIVE or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBHS Wolverines",

        "communication": "PRR 11022021-Anon (NOTE: please refer to this number in all correspondence regarding your request)\r\nDear Anonymous requestor:\r\nOn behalf of the Bellevue School District, I acknowledge receipt of your request as follows:\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND WRITINGS \u2013 PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST FOR ALL ELECTRONIC MAIL (E-MAIL), ELECTRONIC TEXTS, TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS, TELEPHONE MESSAGES, AND TELEPHONE LOGS of the following individuals for the period of time between January 1, 2019 \u2013 November 2, 2021:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafa\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nClarification Questions:\r\n\r\n  1.  Your request seeks communications \u201cof\u201d the above -named individuals. Please define what you intend by \u201cof.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of that would be that you are seeking records \u201cfrom\u201d the above individuals. Are you also seeking records \u201cto\u201d the above-named persons? Are you seeking communications on which the above persons were cc\u2019d?\r\n  2.  I assume you intended to refer to School Board Member Sima Sarrafan. Please correct me if I am mistaken.\r\n  3.  It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n  1.  I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n  2.  I recognize in this regard that you are requesting more recent records be produced first. Please be advised that it may be possible to honor that request within a body of records of a certain type (such as emails). It may not always be possible to do so consistently across all record types, due to differences in how different types of records are assembled.\r\n\r\nIn that regard, please specify a date range that you regard as \u201crecent.\u201d For example, are you requesting that the last 6 months of records be produced for all of the persons named above before any earlier records are produced for any other person, at least within a certain type of record? Please be advised that while the District will try to honor your preferences, the District will retain flexibility in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour answers to the above clarification questions are due on or before December 9, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTiming of Response\r\n\r\nYour request will be completed in a series of installments. At this time, subject to potential adjustment based on your clarifications, I estimate a first installment of records for January 19, 2022. That present estimate is  based on the current workload in this office, staff available to respond to your request, the workload of staff who may be affected by your request and whose assistance may be required, and absences due to illness and/or the anticipated holidays. Response date estimates are subject to change.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Regarding clarification question 1:\r\n\u201cPlease define what you intend by \u201cof.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of that would be that you are seeking records \u201cfrom\u201d the above individuals.\u201d\r\nYour answer included this comment:\r\nRegarding the requested public record communications \"of\" and \"from\" the previously referenced individuals . . ..\r\nIt appears that your answer is that you intend \u201cof\u201d to mean \u201cfrom.\u201d The District will proceed in that manner unless you advise otherwise.\r\n\r\n2.                   Please allow me to explain that In general, email records of each of the named individuals will be searched and produced separately by individual. Some of the search results may be combined in order to avoid a high number of duplications.  The District will retain discretion in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\nAssuming separate production sets for each individual and some combined groups as appropriate, please advise if you would like to prioritize the individuals listed. The District will try to honor any such priorities, within parameters that are consistent with the most efficient processing of your request.\r\n\r\n3.                   You have asked for records to be produced in reverse chronological order, stating that you prefer the District to produce emails first. To clarify, are you asking that all email records back to 1.1.19 for an individual be produced before any records are produced for another individual?\r\n\r\n4.                   You did not respond to the questions numbered 3 and 4 (renumbered below due to formatting loss in your reply message) regarding targeting your request. As noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743.  Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that production of emails in .pst format is not possible. Every record is reviewed for applicable exemptions, and appropriate redactions will be applied prior to the production of records to you. The redaction process occurs only in a .pdf format. Each individual message is converted to a .pdf format.\r\n\r\nYour answers to these questions are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers may affect the timing of the District\u2019s responses to your request. Additional clarification questions may arise in the course of responding to your request.\r\n\r\nI am glad to assist you in accessing records that will be meaningful to you.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

When you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n  1.  communications \u201cfrom\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\nWhen you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n  1.  communications \u201cto\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\nWhen you use the phrase communications \u201cof\u201d an individual, are you referring to:\r\n\r\n  1.  communications \u201ccopied to\u201d that individual? Please answer yes or no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  You have not responded to the following questions sent to you on 11.9.21, numbered 3 and 4 in that message. This is the District\u2019s third request for a response to these questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n3.       It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n4.       I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reminding you om 11.17.21 to respond to questions 3 and 4, I explained the importance to you of your answering these questions:\r\n\r\nAs noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743. Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\nThank you for clarifying your request at the outset. It is essential that we have a mutual understanding. Additional clarifications may arise in the course of processing your request. Your answers to the questions above are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District\u2019s response.\r\n\r\nMissing correspondence history\r\nPlease review the message you sent on 11.19.21 at 1:39 PM, and the message you sent on 11.18.21. In each of those messages, portions of the correspondence history between you and this office were missing, including but not limited to the 11.9.21 message to you containing the clarification questions above, to which you have not yet responded.\r\nPerhaps this is a technical aberration of the service you are using. If necessary, please work with Muckrock to determine why portions of correspondence history related to your request may not be retained when you reply to a message. For example, your 11.19.21 message immediately below contains a history that skips from your message dated 11.02.21 to your message dated 11.11.21. Please take steps to prevent that from occurring in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request Process\r\n\r\nYou state:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo search need be conducted \u2013 archive or copy the entire email account for the dates requested and produce the result preferably in .PST format.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease allow me to help you understand public record response procedures, so that your expectations can be realistic. When a request for records is made, the District conducts a search for potentially responsive records. When potentially responsive records are assembled, each record is reviewed to determine whether it is responsive, and if so, whether the law requires that exemptions be applied to it. If some or all of a record is exempt, the District applies redactions to that record or withholds it, and then describes to the requestor the basis for any exemptions that were applied. As noted below, it is not possible to produce records in .PST format, because records must first be converted to .PDF format in order to apply redactions to them.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it is not possible to \u201ccopy\u201d the contents of \u201can entire email account\u201d and produce all emails within such a an account to you. Each email must first be reviewed, analyzed, and processed for production.\r\n\r\nAs noted in my 11.09.021 message to you, your request will be completed in a series of installments. Due to the procedures described above, only a limited number of email records can be produced per installment. Each request is unique, but given the workload of this office, email records can be generally processed at a rate of perhaps 30-100 individual emails per installment. Installments may occur at varying intervals, which can be 30 days or more. These processing volume rates vary widely based on the nature of the request and other factors.\r\nAs stated above, during the nearly 3-year period you have identified, one of the persons on your list sent 38,743 emails\u2014that is 38,743 emails were \u201cfrom\u201d that person. There may be some duplications within that number. However, even if that number was significantly reduced to something in the range of 20,000 emails, and assuming a rate of processing those records at 100 per month, it could take 200 months, or more than 16 years, to process only the emails \u201cfrom\u201d that one person on your list.\r\n\r\nI am taking the time to explain this to you in detail, at the beginning of processing your request, so that you can understand how important it is to you, assuming your intention is to receive records that are meaningful to you and relate to a legitimate purpose, to limit your request by targeting it in some way as described in questions 3 and 4 above. I can help you find the needle in the haystack that you really want. You do not need to ask for the haystack to achieve your legitimate purpose.\r\n\r\nI am available to assist you in exploring options by which you can limit your request so that it will yield records that will be meaningful to you, while retaining your broader request in case it is needed.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

You requested emails to be produced in reverse chron order, in 6 month blocks, to/from/cc the following persons in this following order:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafan\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nTo give you a sense of the volume of records you have requested, searches of potentially responsive records for the following persons for the first six-month period, 05 01 21 through 11 02 21, returned the following numbers of potentially responsive messages to be reviewed and processed for production to you:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran                                                                   8420\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis                                                                      7245\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas              25,244\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn     13.443\r\nTotal for these 4 individuals, 05 01 21-11 02 21:                                  53,952\r\n\r\nThis installment includes emails to/from/cc Superintendent Ivan Duran for the period 10 01 21-10 14 21. This is roughly the first half of the month of October 2021, consisting of 446 messages. The period 10 15 21-11 02 21 will be the subject of the next installment.\r\n\r\nThe records are being produced to you via Box, from which you may retrieve, view, and download records. Please click the link below to retrieve the following records:\r\nNOTE: I am having technical difficulties creating this link. I will complete this process as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dr. Duran has not been employed by the District since the spring of 2021. As a result, there are no messages from him in this group. The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nMy observation in processing your request to date is that it could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\nNo redactions were made to these records.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for February 25, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

You requested emails to be produced in reverse chron order, in 6 month blocks, to/from/cc the following persons in this following order:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafan\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nThis installment includes emails to/from/cc Superintendent Ivan Duran for the period 10 15 21 through 10 21 2021. It includes 227 messages. The period 10 22 2021 through 11 02 2021 will be the subject of the next installment.\r\n\r\nThe records are being produced to you via Box, from which you may retrieve, view, and download records, within 30 days of receipt. A link will be provided to you to access the records in a message that will follow shortly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dr. Duran has not been employed by the District since the spring of 2021. As a result, there are no messages from him in this group. The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nYour request could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the number of persons whose communications are sought; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\n\r\nRedactions were made to one record in this set, consistent with exemptions set forth in the Public Records Act. Redactions are indicated by blocked out text with an overlying code. I have also attached to this message a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis for the exemptions that applied.  If there are any records that contain marked out texts that do not have an overlying code, that is the form in which the record was received by the District.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for March 30, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Please do not interrupt our correspondence history by cutting messages out of the email string. I know that history can get long. However, it is important in order for us to communicate effectively that an accurate history of our communications is readily available to both of us.\r\nPlease allow me to summarize our recent correspondence:\r\n\r\nFeb 25\u2013email from BSD, making second installment consisting of 227 emails, and providing link to Box for records.\r\nFeb 26\u2014confirmation from Box site to BSD that you accepted and opened link to records.\r\nJune 29\u2014email from you, stating you had received only one installment, on 1.9.22.\r\nJune 29\u2013email from BSD, setting a next installment for July 21.\r\nJuly 15\u2014email from you, inquiring as to status. Appears to be automated Muckrock email. June 29 message from BSD does not appear to have been read.\r\nJuly 21\u2014email from BSD, inquiring further about your statement on June 29 that you had received only one installment, and listing two installments that were produced. Attached your 2.26.22 acceptance of link to second installment provided via Box site. Advised that estimated installment intended for July 21 would be extended to July 22.\r\nJuly 25, 26, 28 \u2013 emails from BSD, extending estimated dates from July 22 to August 1, with explanations.\r\nAug 3\u2013email from you, explaining (for the first time) that you were not able to open the link to records that were sent to you on 2.25.22.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 Produced to You Again\r\nFirst, let\u2019s take care of your receipt of the records in the February 25 installment. You were advised in a February 25 email that a link to the records was on its way to you. I received confirmation on February 26 that you accepted and opened the link that was sent to you. Now, on August 3, you explain for the first time that you were not able to retrieve records in the link that was provided to you. If you had let me know in February that you had difficulty retrieving the records, we could have resolved it at that time. I recognize there may be glitches with technology. I am glad to work with you to resolve them promptly, if you let me know.\r\n\r\nEach installment is made available to you for 30 days. In the future, if you do not acknowledge and accept receipt of records within 30 days after they are made available to you, your request will be closed as abandoned.\r\n\r\nI am re-sending you the records that were provided to you in installment 2 on February 25, 2021. I will attach these to two emails to you, due to their volume.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 consisted of 227 email records covering a period of October 15-21, 2021, in zip folders are follows:\r\n2021 10 15_10 19, Duran, 122 (attached here)\r\n2021 10 20_10 21, Duran, 105 (will be attached to an email that follows)\r\n\r\nThe second zip folder includes a record that contains information that is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act. Exempt information is redacted and marked with an overlay code. I will attach to the following email a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis of exemptions applied.\r\n\r\nProgress on your high-volume request\r\nPlease appreciate the overall high volume of your request, when there are 227 email records in one week for one of your named recipients. Each individual email record you request must be retrieved from archives, reviewed for applicability to your request and for exemptions, and then prepared for production to you.\r\nDue to typical operational capacity of this department, it is generally possible to process roughly 100 email records per installment, and to make installments to a requestor every 60 to 90 days. These are general capacity numbers, which may be adjusted in different contexts for different types of requests. Most requestors seek specific information that is likely to be meaningful to them, which allows for effective and efficient request processing.\r\nYour request, on the other hand, seeks a high volume of communications, from a large group of persons, with no specific focus or topic. As a result, the volume of records will be is very high, the retrieval time is extensive, and the review process is very time-consuming.\r\nYou have been provided 446 records in installment 1, Jan 19 2022; and 227 records in installment 2, February 25 2022, for a total of 673 records. This is well within standard processing rate.\r\n\r\nNext Estimated Installment\r\nThe District attempts to meet its estimated installment dates. Sometimes that is not possible. If it is not possible to meet an estimated date, you will be provided an explanation and a revised estimated date.\r\nThe time it took to complete today\u2019s correspondence was time the District was not able to devote to a next installment to you.\r\nI estimate a next installment for September 1, 2022. That estimate takes into account factors of summer staff absences; staff absences for other reasons, including medical leaves; the current workload of this department; and the complexity of assembly and review required for your request as set forth above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

The reports cite several critical errors and document interviews with staff before and after inspections, which ultimately led to the relicensing of the facility at the end of 2022.

I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Welsh",

As such the review was on hold pending responses from those offices. This week, I was able to get a response from both agencies and can now move forward with my review.

        "communication": "PRR 04262021-Anon-Muckrock\r\nDear Requestor:\r\nIn this message, on behalf of the Bellevue School District, I am completing the District's initial response to your request, making a first installment of responsive records, and posing some clarification questions to you.\r\nI understand your request, received April 26, 2021, to be:\r\n\r\n\r\nDigital copies of all video recordings of internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions, town halls, school board meetings, and google classroom sessions in the District's care, custody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo clarify, if the District is in possession of any digital recordings of Zoom meeting calls, Skype Sessions, Google Duo calls, Slack, Gotomeeting, etc. (any recorded internet-based video communication/presentation/instruction product) for the period of time 01-01-20 through 4-22-21 I am requesting a digital copy to be produced via internet web link.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe District search for these digitally recorded videos should include all computers and digital storage devices owned, operated, or controlled by the District.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe District search for these digitally recorded videos should also include a search of all computers and digital storage devices owned, operated, or controlled by District employees if the digital video was recorded on equipment provided to the employee by the District, or if the digital video recording contains content relating to District agency related matters.\r\n\r\nI request the digital video files to be delivered unedited whenever possible and in the original format in which the files were digitally recorded and stored.\r\n\r\nYour request is potentially exceedingly voluminous and will be completed in a series of installments. This message contains the first installment, addressing recorded \"school board meetings\" and \"classroom sessions.\"\r\n\r\nResponse with respect to video recordings of school board meetings\r\nVideos of school board meetings are posted on the District's website. You may retrieve them as follows:\r\nGo to https://bsd405.org/about/school-board/. Scroll down and select \"Go to BoardDocs.\"  In BoardDocs, select \"Meetings\" from the ribbon at top right. On the left, use the dropdown menu to select the date of meeting in which you have an interest. When you select the date of any Regular Meeting of the Board of Directors, an icon labelled \"Watch video\" will appear. In most cases, these video recordings contain audio content only. Records referred to may be viewed by clicking on the \"View the Agenda\" icon.\r\n\r\nResponse with respect to recorded classroom sessions\r\nThe District does not use \"google classroom sessions.\" Further, where students are present or referred to in any recorded classroom session, those records are fully exempt under RCW 42.56.230(1) (personal information in any files maintained for students in public schools); and under RCW 42.56.070(1) (exemptions authorized outside PRA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 USC section 1232g (education records or any personally identifiable information in education records is exempt from disclosure to third parties without adult student or parent consent).\r\n\r\nGenerally, with respect to other types of recordings\r\nPlease see the following links to the District's website, where recent District-wide town hall meetings and other types of recordings may be or may have been posted:\r\nDistrict website: https://bsd405.org/\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bsd405<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbsd405&data=04%7C01%7Cpublicrecords%40bsd405.org%7C5508a3f2a3e1401be6d008d90b411fb4%7C994a41397c06491e809879006d575de0%7C0%7C0%7C637553196587929667%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=8kzBso1VJsyXO5FMpes0bPoT7Kdu%2B4k5PyDGD0Cq13M%3D&reserved=0>\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheBSD405<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FTheBSD405&data=04%7C01%7Cpublicrecords%40bsd405.org%7C5508a3f2a3e1401be6d008d90b411fb4%7C994a41397c06491e809879006d575de0%7C0%7C0%7C637553196587939661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Nt4p%2BP29zz7Vyudzs4v8wAhoH9z3z7sgp4ZOyldfoG8%3D&reserved=0>\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bellevueschools405/<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbellevueschools405%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cpublicrecords%40bsd405.org%7C5508a3f2a3e1401be6d008d90b411fb4%7C994a41397c06491e809879006d575de0%7C0%7C0%7C637553196587939661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=UcBzaQQeyD%2BVRW2NvoEvSntMLFsa89obn403NAkwVF0%3D&reserved=0>\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\nAssembly and review work is proceeding with respect to the other types of recordings you have identified, i.e., \"internet-based video calls,\" \"meetings,\" \"training sessions,\" and \"town halls.\"  Before the District will be able to proceed, your answers to the following clarification questions will be required.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\n  1.  Some \"town halls\" are conducted at the District level and some are conducted at a school building level. The District has 29 schools, any of which may have conducted and recorded \"town halls\" with its student and parent communities. Many town hall meetings, especially at the building level, are likely to contain information protected by FERPA (cited above). Please advise if you are interested only in recordings of District-wide town hall meetings.\r\n  2.  Digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, [and] training sessions\" are not centrally maintained.  Retrieval of such recordings would require communication with approximately 2,500 District employees who may have recorded such a call, meeting, or training session. The volume of potentially responsive records may be exceedingly high and may require hundreds or thousands of hours of content review to identify exempt material. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction process may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not have the technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive scale.  Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n  3.  Digital recordings of \"training sessions\" are likely to be subject to copyright protection, and trade secret or other proprietary exemptions. A consideration of the release of such recordings would in most cases require review by the content owner or originator, to identify protected content. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction process may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not have the  technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive scale. Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n  4.  Additionally, although you state that your request is not commercial in nature, in many cases the digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions [and] town halls\" would inherently contain lists of individuals, identifiable by the fact that they would in many cases be shown as signed in to the call, meeting, training session, or town hall. Therefore, your request for such materials requires a commercial purposes inquiry. Please complete the attached Commercial Purpose Declaration within 30 days if you intend to proceed with these portions of your request. If you do not return the Declaration, your request will be closed.\r\n\r\nPlease answer these clarification questions within 30 days, that is, on or before June 2, 2021. The District's analysis and assessment of your request may result in additional clarification questions.\r\nIf additional materials are identified that can be disclosed to you, subject to the issues expressed in the clarification questions above, I estimate July 15 as a tentative next installment date. However, that estimate may have to be altered, depending on your answers to the clarification questions above.\r\nI am glad to assist you if you wish to discuss.\r\nFinally, it is possible that there may be a delay in our communications due to firewalls in the District's email system that flag emails that appear to be spam or solicitations. In my experience, that can be remedied by the identification of a named sender. Please consider providing a named sender (in some way that will protect your anonymity, if you still wish to preserve it) if that appears to be a problem (e.g., in why you apparently thought the District received your request on April 22, when in fact it was received on April 25, a weekend day, and was deemed received on April 26).\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Boyer\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nBellevue School District No. 405\r\npublicrecords@bsd405.org\r\n\r\nMay 6, 2021\r\n\r\nRE: 1st installment, addressing recorded \"school board meetings\" and \"classroom sessions.\"\r\n\r\nHello Ms. Boyer,\r\n\r\nPlease see my responses to your 1st installment and answers to your requests for clarification:\r\n\r\nWith respect to video recordings of school board meetings\r\n\r\nVideos of school board meetings are posted on the District's website. You may retrieve them as follows:\r\nGo to https://bsd405.org/about/school-board/. Scroll down and select \"Go to BoardDocs.\" In BoardDocs, select \"Meetings\" from the ribbon at top right. On the left, use the dropdown menu to select the date of meeting in which you have an interest. When you select the date of any Regular Meeting of the Board of Directors, an icon labelled \"Watch video\" will appear. In most cases, these video recordings contain audio content only. Records referred to may be viewed by clicking on the \u201cView the Agenda\u201d icon.\r\n\r\nResponse: Thank you.\r\n\r\nWith respect to recorded classroom sessions\r\n\r\nThe District does not use \"google classroom sessions.\" Further, where students are present orreferred to in any recorded classroom session, those records are fully exempt under RCW 42.56.230(1) (personal information in any files maintained for students in public schools); and under RCW 42.56.070(1) (exemptions authorized outside PRA) and the Family Educational Rights \tand Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 USC section 1232g (education records or any personally identifiable information in education records is exempt from disclosure to third parties without \tadult student or parent consent).\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n\r\nWith all due respect, while digital video recordings where students are present or referred to certainly could be wholly exempt from disclosure to third parties, this is certainly not always going to be the case. Public records act exemptions are subject to very specific State and Federal statutes and circumstances. \r\n\r\nThe request for copies of any digital video recordings of classroom sessions for the requested period of time is not necessarily exempt in whole. The District has the responsibility to search for digital video recordings of classroom sessions and then redact student information where appropriate under statute, then producing the remainder of the non-exempt record or in this matter digital video file.\r\n\r\nQuite probably digital video recordings wholly or partially redacted by the District based on specific exemptions would still provide the requestor the name of the video file, the date and time of the recording, the length of the recording, the place of recording, the method of recording, the storage location of the digital video file itself, metadata not subject to redaction, and more. \r\n\r\nFrom the BELLEVUE SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 Public Records Request Website:\r\n\r\nhttps://bsd405.org/departments/records/public-records/\r\n\r\n\u201cIf the record requested for inspection and/or copying contains both information exempted from disclosure and nonexempt information, the District will produce as much of the record as possible, with the exempt portion redacted, and will provide a written explanation for the redaction.\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease search for and provide digital video recordings of classroom sessions and redact where appropriate.\r\n \r\nGenerally, with respect to other types of recordings\r\n\r\nPlease see the following links to the District's website, where recent District-wide town hall \tmeetings and other types of recordings may be or may have been posted Facebook, Twitter, \tand Instagram <links omitted>\r\n\r\nResponse:  Thank you.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\nAssembly and review work is proceeding with respect to the other types of recordings \tyou \thave identified, i.e., \"internet-based video calls,\" \"meetings,\" \"training sessions,\" and \t\"town \thalls.\" Before the District will be able to proceed, your answers to the following clarification questions will be required.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\n1. Some \"town halls\" are conducted at the District level and some are conducted at a school building level. The District has 29 schools, any of which may have conducted and recorded \"town halls\" with its student and parent communities. Many town hall meetings, especially at the building level, are likely to contain information protected by FERPA (cited above). Please advise if you are interested only in recordings of District-wide town hall meetings.\r\n\r\nAgain, please refer to my response regarding the production of digital video recordings of classroom sessions and Bellevue School District policy regarding providing as much of the record as possible, with the exempt portions redacted, and then providing a written explanation for any redactions.\r\n\r\nI am requesting all digital video recordings for the time period specified.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n2. Digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, [and] training sessions\" are not centrally maintained. Retrieval of such recordings would require communication with approximately 2,500 District employees who may have recorded such a call, meeting, or training session. The volume of potentially responsive records may be exceedingly high and may require hundreds or thousands of hours of content review to identify exempt material. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction \tprocess may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not \thave the technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive \tscale. Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate the District has chosen not to centrally maintain digital video recordings subject to public record requests. It may be prudent for the District to draft policy (should no policy currently be in place) governing the approximately 2,500 District employees who are directed or may choose to produce digital video recordings subject to public records requests.\r\n\r\nAs you know under the Public Records Act, agencies cannot charge for the time staff time spend locating a public record or making it available for inspection (including any time spent reviewing or redacting records).\r\nThe Bellevue School Board found that it would be \u201cunduly burdensome to calculate the actual costs of providing copies of public records, given the multiple electronic and manual devices used to do so, as well as the fluctuating costs of District supplies, equipment, and labor.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the District adopted the \u201cStatutory default cost\u201d option for calculating fees:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe District has determined it will not calculate actual costs for copying records for the reasons \tset forth in Policy 4040. The District will apply the fees and costs as authorized in RCW 42.56.120 \tand as published in the agency's fee schedule.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fees for production of digital video recordings under the statutory default cost option are as follows:\r\n\r\nElectronic Documents: $0.05 per every four electronic files and/or email.\r\nTransmission of electronic records: $0.10 per gigabyte.\r\n\r\nA 1 Hour time length digital video recording of a ZOOM online video meeting results in a digital video file of approximately 1.2 gigabytes in size. Using these approximate calculations (4) 1-hour digital video recordings (1.2 Gb in size) produced by the district would generate fees of (4 files) x (.05) x (.10) = .60 or 60 cents. The fees may be marginally higher should the District choose to produce the requested files on CD-ROM. The District may charge the requestor for the cost of the CD-ROM itself as well as any postage. \r\n\r\nIf in the regular course of agency business the District and it\u2019s approximately 2,500 public employees have the technological capability to record and store digital videos on publicly owned computers and devices, the District certainly has the staff and technological ability to produce these digital videos subject to the Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question \u201cPlease clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request\u201d I do continue to seek such records. I have specified the records requested for a specific time period in my original public records request.\r\n\r\nFor efficiencies sake I would suggest the District designate a central digital repository on District computer servers to store all digital video files subject to public record requests and then to instruct all District employees to upload any digital video recordings for the requested time period to the designated central digital repository for review and production under the PRA. \r\n\r\nOf course recording, storing, and digitally transmitting digital video files is not technologically complicated and also comprises a regular function of various District employees on a daily basis. \r\n\r\n3. Digital recordings of \"training sessions\" are likely to be subject to copyright protection, and trade secret or other proprietary exemptions. A consideration of the release of such recordings would in most cases require review by the content owner or originator, to identify protected content. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction process may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not have the technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive scale. Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n\r\nCopyright is subject to certain limited exemptions and the District should redact accordingly. I do continue to seek these records. Please see my earlier responses.\r\n\r\n4. Additionally, although you state that your request is not commercial in nature, in many cases the digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions [and] town halls\" would inherently contain lists of individuals, identifiable by the fact that they would in many cases be shown as signed in to the call, meeting, training session, or town hall. Therefore, your request for such materials requires a commercial purposes inquiry. Please complete the attached Commercial Purpose Declaration within 30 days if you intend to proceed with these portions of your request. If you do not return the Declaration, your \trequest will be closed.\r\n\r\nResponse regarding your commercial purpose inquiry and declaration:\r\n\r\nThe PRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). Digital video recordings by their very nature do not contain an electronic record that can be sorted as could an Excel spreadsheet or Word document. I renew my declaration contained in my original public records request:  I am not seeking a list of any kind, nor a list of individuals or businesses.\r\n\r\nIn my original public records request I specifically declared the request was not being made for commercial purposes, a requirement of the Public Records Act. I incorporate by reference my original public records request and declaration dated 4-22-21:\r\n\r\n\u201cRequest for digital copies of all internet video call recordings in the District's care, custody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21 (Bellevue School District).\u201d\r\n\r\nThis declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response to your requests for clarification. \r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

Please refer to the PRR number above in the subject line of your correspondence with the District.\r\nCosts\r\nYour response neglects to refer to the customized service charge provision at page 7 of the District\u2019s Procedure 4040P, https://bsd405.org/wp-content/pdf/policy/4040P.pdf.\r\nIn order to develop a centralized location for storage and access services for what may be thousands of hours of digital video recordings, and to acquire and/or develop the technology expertise to prepare that compiled data for production to you, when such compilations and customized access services are not used by the District for any other District purpose, the District would have to assess a customized service charge.\r\nPlease advise if you would like to amend your request in order to avoid or reduce the cost of a customized service charge.\r\nAdditionally, the District\u2019s Procedure at pp 7-8 permits it to make an alternative fee arrangement with any requestor in response to a voluminous request.\r\nIt may be possible to discuss an arrangement, for example, by which you could partially reduce the cost of a customized service charge by inspecting the recorded videos in person and selecting those records of which you wish to obtain a copy. We could consider setting up an area in which you could inspect such recordings. You would not be permitted to take any kind of recording device into that area.\r\n\r\nDeclaration of Commercial Purpose\r\nThere is nothing in RCW 42.56.070(8) that states that a list must be in Excel or another sortable format to be subject to the commercial purpose declaration.

        "communication": "May 10, 2021\r\n\r\nPRR 04262021-Anon-Muckrock\r\n\r\nHello Ms. Boyer,\r\n\r\nPlease see my responses to your communication of 05-07-2021:\r\n\r\nThank you for that prompt response. Please refer to the PRR number above in the subject line\r\nof your correspondence with the District.\r\n\r\nCosts\r\nYour response neglects to refer to the customized service charge provision at page 7 of the\r\nDistrict\u2019s Procedure 4040P, https://bsd405.org/wp-content/pdf/policy/4040P.pdf.\r\n\r\nResponse: No customized service charge applies to this public records request.\r\n\r\nSee RCW 42.56.120 (3)(a)(i):\r\n\u201cA customized service charge may only be imposed if the agency estimates that the request would\r\nrequire the use of information technology expertise to prepare data compilations, or provide\r\ncustomized electronic access services when such compilations and customized access services are not used by the agency for other agency purposes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis public records request does not seek a data compilation, only digital video recordings.\r\n\r\nThis public records request does not require customized electronic access services not used by the\r\nDistrict for other District purposes.\r\n\r\nThis public records request is seeking copies of digital video recordings in the care, control, or\r\npossession of the District.\r\n\r\nThe District can produce these recordings without the need for special or extraordinary information\r\ntechnology personnel, hardware, or software.\r\n\r\nThe digital video recordings requested were not generated or created by specialized information\r\ntechnology personnel, and no special information technology is required to produce digital recordings in response to this request.\r\n\r\nThe District bears the burden of redacting public records (including digital video recordings) and cannot charge the records requestor for the time and cost of redaction.\r\n\r\nThe District can charge for the copy and transmission of these digital video recordings at the rates per\r\nfile and per GB transmitted as previously established.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop a centralized location for storage and access services for what may be\r\nthousands of hours of digital video recordings, and to acquire and/or develop the technology\r\nexpertise to prepare that compiled data for production to you, when such compilations and\r\ncustomized access services are not used by the District for any other District purpose, the\r\nDistrict would have to assess a customized service charge.\r\n\r\nResponse:  The District need not develop any centralized location for storage and access of digital video recordings. In my previous response to you I was simply making a suggestion as to how (in my personal opinion) the District could more efficiently process digital video recordings as public records. The District is under no obligation to create a central repository for digital video recordings and I am not requesting the District do so.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if you would like to amend your request in order to avoid or reduce the cost of a\r\ncustomized service charge.\r\n\r\nResponse: As I stated earlier, no customized service charge is warranted for this public records request for digital video recordings. If you feel I am mistaken, please explain as per RCW 42.56.120 (3)(b):\r\n\r\n1. Please explain why a customized service charge applies?\r\n2. Please provide a description of the specific expertise warranting the application of a customized\r\nservice charge.\r\n3. Please provide a reasonable estimate of the cost of the customized service charge.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the District\u2019s Procedure at pp 7-8 permits it to make an alternative fee\r\narrangement with any requestor in response to a voluminous request.\r\nIt may be possible to discuss an arrangement, for example, by which you could partially reduce\r\nthe cost of a customized service charge by inspecting the recorded videos in person and\r\nselecting those records of which you wish to obtain a copy. We could consider setting up an\r\narea in which you could inspect such recordings. You would not be permitted to take any kind\r\nof recording device into that area.\r\n\r\nResponse: No thank you.\r\n\r\nDeclaration of Commercial Purpose\r\nThere is nothing in RCW 42.56.070(8) that states that a list must be in Excel or another\r\nsortable format to be subject to the commercial purpose declaration. The names of\r\nparticipants in many digital recordings are in the form of lists. Please complete the\r\nCommercial Purpose Declaration, which I have again attached for your reference, by June 2,\r\n2021.\r\n\r\nResponse: You are correct, nothing in RCW 42.56.070(8) states a list must be in Excel or a sortable\r\nformat. I was only attempting to provide an example of what the courts and Washington State Statute\r\nhas defined as a \u201clist\u201d under RCW 42.56.070(8). In any event, the application of RCW 42.56.070(8)\r\nconcerns a public records request seeking a \u201clist\u201d of natural individuals.\r\n\r\nWith all due respect, the names of participants displayed in a digital video recording is not a \u201clist\u201d as\r\ndefined by RCW 42.56.070(8):\r\n\u201cThis chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency, the office of the secretary of the senate, or the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives to give, sell or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes, and agencies, the office of the secretary of the senate, and the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives shall not do so unless specifically authorized or directed by law: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That lists of applicants for professional licenses and of professional licensees shall be made available to those professional associations or educational organizations recognized by their professional licensing or examination board, upon payment of a reasonable charge therefor: PROVIDED FURTHER, That such recognition may be refused only for a good cause pursuant to a hearing under the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative procedure act.\u201d\r\n\r\nJust as an email or any other document also not a \u201clist,\u201d the District has the option to redact any names that might be displayed in a digital video recording based on a valid exemption should there be one.\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Purpose Declaration form (affidavit) which you have provided titled \u201cREQUEST FOR\r\nLIST OF NAMES\u201d does not apply to this Public Records request as no list of names was requested in the original public records request and the District has the option to redact any responsive videos files produced under the law.\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

You cannot walk in off the street into a parent or student meeting with a teacher, or into a classroom of students.  Similarly, you are not entitled to the content of digital video calls with parents or students, or to the content of a remotely conducted  classroom.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if the extensive records you have been provided are sufficient for your purposes.\r\n\r\nAs set forth in my message to you dated May 3, 2021, a next phase of records production would require disruptive and time-consuming recovery from individual employees, added storage capacity, extensive and time-consuming copying of recorded video into redactable formats and/or for the purpose of creating a copy for redaction, and review, analysis, and anticipated redaction of exempt material. This is likely to require the purchase of hardware and software that is not presently available to nor within the technical expertise of staff that responds to public records. As I have advised you, the District is evaluating the costs of customized service charges that would be associated with those purchases and tasks. The copying is likely to require software and hardware purchases, training, and added staff. There may also be additional costs of storage devices and data transmission for which you would be responsible.\r\n\r\nIf you require additional records, I estimate a next installment in response to your request will be September 23, 2021. This estimate considers the factors described above, as well as the fact that many of the staff from whom such records would be assembled will soon be leaving for the summer break.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the District cannot proceed further until it receives and has evaluated a completed and signed Commercial Purpose Declaration, for the reasons that have been explained to you. The Declaration is due on or before June 2, 2021.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

However please note, the original public records request is for \u201cDigital copies of all video recordings of internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions, town halls, school board meetings, and google classroom sessions\u2026\u201d The various links you have provided do not contain any digital copies of the video recordings originally requested. Also, the links do not provide information about what digital video files have been produced, and which have been withheld in their entirety, nor which digital video files have been edited and for what reason.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, this public records request is seeking digital copies of specific digital media files, not links to stream partial content of the original files without a detailed exemption log explaining what has been withheld and why.\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\t\r\n\u201cPlease advise if the extensive records you have been provided are sufficient for your \tpurposes.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\nHyperbole aside, no requested records (digital media files) have been produced. Links to 3rd party subscription based streaming media sites are not the records that have been requested.\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\t\u201cThe District has advised you that where students are present or referred to in any video call \tor recorded classroom session, those records are fully exempt. You cannot walk in off the\tstreet into a parent or student meeting with a teacher, or into a classroom of students. \tSimilarly, you are not entitled to the content of digital video calls with parents or students, \tor to the content of a remotely conducted classroom.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nWith all due respect, any recorded digital video files (records) in the possession of the District where students are present or referenced are NOT FULLY EXEMPT. Rather these digital video files could potentially be partially exempt and some exemptions may be subject to redaction by the District. Any such exemptions applied are required to be recorded in an accompanying detailed exemption log for review by the requestor.\r\n\r\nExamples of what may not be fully exempt in any digital media file: the name of the digital media file, the type of file, the size of the file, various nonexempt portions of the file video content, the length of the recording, the date the file was created, and possibly much more.\r\n\r\nAll citizens are \u201centitled\u201d to review and/or copy public records in the District\u2019s care, custody, or control subject to redaction by the District based on valid legal exemptions. Exemptions which the District is required to detail in an exemption log provided to the requestor for review.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Is the District\u2019s position that all digital video files in which a student is present or referenced are fully exempt and therefore will not be produced? \r\n\r\nQuestion: If in fact it is the District\u2019s position is that digital video files in which a student is present are fully exempt, is the District going to provide the required detailed exemption logs to the requestor, listing which digital video files are exempt and why?\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\u201cAs set forth in my message to you dated May 3, 2021, a next phase of records production would require disruptive and time-consuming recovery from individual employees, added \tstorage capacity, extensive and time-consuming copying of recorded video into redactable \tformats and/or for the purpose of creating a copy for redaction, and review, analysis, and anticipated redaction of exempt material. This is likely to require the purchase of hardware \tand software that is not presently available to nor within the technical expertise of staff that \tresponds to public records. As I have advised you, the District is evaluating the costs of \tcustomized service charges that would be associated with those purchases and tasks. The copying is likely to require software and hardware purchases, training, and added staff. There  may also be additional costs of storage devices and data transmission for which you would be \tresponsible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nThe District\u2019s responsibilities under the Public Records Act are clear. To address your comments point by point: \r\n\r\n\u201cdisruptive and time-consuming recovery from individual employees\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease see WAC 44-14-04003(3) \u201cThe agency should recognize that fulfilling public records requests is one of the agency's duties, along with its others.\u201d These public employees created digital video files that are now public record. It is certainly not \u201cdisruptive\u201d for public employees to produce identifiable public records.\r\n\r\n\u201cadded storage capacity\u201d\r\n\r\nQuestion: Why the need for added storage capacity? Regardless, irrelevant under the Public Records Act.\r\n\r\n\u201cextensive and time-consuming copying of recorded video into redactable formats and/or for the purpose of creating a copy for redaction\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain, irrelevant. All costs of preparation for responsive documents and any redactions if required is the sole responsibility of the District. No costs for collation or redaction may be passed on to the original requestor under the act. See WAC 44-14-07001:\r\n\r\n\tWAC 44-14-07001 General rules for charging for copies.\r\n\t(1) No fees for costs of locating records or preparing records for inspection or copying. An \tagency cannot charge a fee for locating public records or for preparing the records for \tinspection or copying. RCW 42.56.120.1 An agency cannot charge fees for a person to inspect or \taccess records on the agency's public internet web site. An agency cannot charge a fee for \taccess to or downloading records the agency routinely posts on its public internet web site prior \tto the receipt of a request unless the requestor has specifically requested that the agency \tprovide copies of such records through other means. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(e).\r\n\r\n\tAn agency cannot charge a \"redaction fee\" for the staff time necessary to prepare the records \tfor inspection, for the copying required to redact records before they are inspected, or an \tarchive fee for getting the records from off-site. Op. Att'y Gen. 6 (1991). These are the costs of \tmaking the records available for inspection or copying and cannot be charged to the requestor.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is likely to require the purchase of hardware and software that is not presently available  to nor within the technical expertise of staff that responds to public records.\u201d\r\n\r\nUntrue  however if so, also irrelevant. As clearly stated, the District cannot assess fees for costs of locating records or preparing records for inspection or copying. The District is in possession of public records in the form of digital media files. These public records have been identified and requested per the Public Records Act and the District is required to produce these records in compliance with the act.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I have advised you, the District is evaluating the costs of customized service charges that would be associated with those purchases and tasks. The copying is likely to require software and hardware purchases, training, and added staff. There may also be additional costs of storage devices and data transmission for which you would be responsible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nAs I requested previously, please provide a detailed accounting of the customized service charge the District believes applies to this public records request. I believe once the District produces a detailed record of any proposed customized service charge it will be simple to demonstrate the District is in error, and no customized service charge applies to this public records request under the PRA (RCW 42.56).\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you require additional records, I estimate a next installment in response to your request will be September 23, 2021. This estimate considers the factors described above, as well as the fact that many of the staff from whom such records would be assembled will soon be leaving for the summer break.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nAs I previously stated, no requested records have been produced by the District to date, and my previous request for the District to provide a detailed accounting of any proposed customized service charge is still outstanding. District staff vacations do not relieve the District of its responsibilities under the public records act. \r\n\r\nAdditionally the District should advise all employees, volunteers, contractors, and any other 3rd parties who may have care, custody, or control of any digital video files originally requested in PRR 04262021 to preserve these public records until this request is resolved. \r\n\r\nPlease consider WAC 44-14-04003(9) as constructive notice:\r\n\t\u201cWAC 44-14-04003(9) Preserving requested records. If a requested record is scheduled shortly \tfor destruction, and the agency receives a public records request for it, the record cannot be \tdestroyed until the request is resolved. RCW 42.56.100.8 Once a request has been closed, the \tagency can destroy the requested records in accordance with its retention schedule.\u201d\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\t\u201cAdditionally, the District cannot proceed further until it receives and has evaluated a completed and signed Commercial Purpose Declaration, for the reasons that have been explained to you. The Declaration is due on or before June 2, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nI previously addressed your multiple requests for a signed \u201cREQUEST FOR LIST OF NAMES\u201d document. \r\n\r\nDigital video files are not a \u201clist\u201d as defined in RCW 42.56.070(8).\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Purpose Declaration form (affidavit) which you have provided titled \u201cREQUEST FOR LIST OF NAMES\u201d does not apply to this Public Records request as no list of names was requested in the original public records request and the District has the option to redact any names that might be displayed as a list in any digital video recording based on a valid exemption should there be one.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Is it the District\u2019s position that PRR 04262021 \u2013 this request for copies of digital video files will not proceed without the requestor signing the District\u2019s \u201cREQUEST FOR LIST OF NAMES\u201d document?\r\n\r\nAt this point it certainly appears that the District is not applying a good faith interpretation of the statues governing public records, nor providing \u201cfullest assistance\" and \"most timely possible action\" (WAC 44-14-04003(3)) in processing PRR 04262021.\r\n\r\nThe District is constructively denying the processing of this public records request. I formally request an immediate denial review of PRR 04262021 by District legal counsel. If in a reasonable amount of time a denial review by the District does not provide the relief requested, I reserve the right under RCW 42.56.550 to seek Judicial review of the District\u2019s position in Superior Court.\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

You state, \u201cThe various links you have provided do not contain any digital copies of the video recordings originally requested.\u201d That is not correct. You have been provided with access to hundreds of original digital video recordings that are responsive to your request.\r\nReferring a requestor by means of a link to an agency\u2019s publicly maintained webpage or website, on which requested records are or may be posted, is an appropriate manner in which to respond to a public records request.\r\nI do not understand your objection in this regard. If you need assistance retrieving the digital video recordings posted on the sites to which I have provided links, please advise.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Commercial Purposes Declaration, you have pointed out that it contained a caption, \u201cRequest for List of Names.\u201d I offered to you the option of striking out that caption, and initialing your strikeout, if you believed the caption did not apply. To accommodate you further, I have attached a revised version of the Declaration in which that caption is removed. You may complete this version of the Declaration if you prefer. I will extend the due date for returning the Declaration, for your convenience, to June 8, 2021.\r\nAs you acknowledged on May 10, there is nothing in RCW 42.56.070(8) that states that a list is defined as one in Excel or another sortable format. A request that seeks a list of individuals is subject to an inquiry under RCW 42.56.080(2). The names of participants in many digital recordings are shown within the recording. For that reason, it is appropriate for the District to conduct an inquiry under RCW 42.56.080(2).\r\n\r\nI have not represented that the District does not intend to produce additional records. To the contrary, I have appropriately informed you of the estimated timeframe for producing such records, and have explained the factors affecting that estimate.\r\nAs earlier noted, the District is evaluating a customized service charge.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

The petition shall include a copy of or reasonably identify the written statement by the Public Records Officer or designee denying the request.\r\nConsideration of Petition for Review\r\nThe Public Records Officer shall promptly refer the petition to a District official designated to conduct the review, who will immediately consider the petition and either affirm or reverse the denial within two business days following the District\u2019s receipt of the petition, or within such other time to which the District and the requestor mutually agree.\r\n\r\nIf you intend to request an internal review, you may petition in writing under Procedure 4040P. \u201cThe petition shall include a copy of or reasonably identify the written statement by the Public Records Officer or designee denying the request.\u201d\r\n\r\nYour request has not been denied. You have been provided access to hundreds of digital copies of video recordings as you requested. Also, you have been provided with an estimated date of September 23, 2021 for a third installment.\r\n\r\nIf your request for a review under Procedure 4040P is intended to address the question of the District\u2019s inquiry as to a commercial purpose under RCW 42.56.080(2), please identify that issue in the petition.\r\nIt is the District\u2019s position that it has the right and statutory obligation under RCW 42.56.080(2) to conduct such an inquiry with respect to your request. The Declaration forms you have been provided explain the statutory basis for this obligation. Until you submit a completed and signed Commercial Purposes Declaration, and the District has completed its inquiry, the District will not be able to proceed to process additional potentially responsive recordings. The reason for this is that additional potentially responsive recordings may contain auditory and/or visual lists of individuals. In order to properly respond further to your request, and to avoid duplicative review and processing, the District needs to complete its inquiry as to whether your request has a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nPlease advise whether you will complete the Commercial Purposes Declaration provided to you earlier today, as revised (attached), by the extended deadline of June 8, 2021.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

If you need assistance retrieving the digital \r\n video recordings posted on the sites to which I have provided links, please advise.\u201d \r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE: \r\n\r\nYou provided links to STREAM or VIEW digital videos online. I have requested COPIES of the digital video \r\nmedia files themselves. The links you have sent to not provide a digital copy of the original video, which \r\nis what was originally requested. \r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia on the nature of Streaming Media: \r\n\r\n Streaming media is multimedia that is delivered and consumed in a continuous manner \r\n from a source, with little or no intermediate storage in network elements. Streaming refers to \r\n the delivery method of content, rather than the content itself. \r\n\r\n Streaming is an alternative to file downloading, a process in which the end-user obtains the \r\n entire file for the content before watching or listening to it. \r\n\r\nThe links you provided to STREAM the digital video files all stream videos that appear to have been \r\nedited. What content has been edited from the original videos? What are the file names of each digital \r\nvideo file? When was each digital file created? In what format was each digital video file stored? Why \r\nhave you not provided exemption logs explaining what content was redacted or edited from each digital \r\nmedia file and why? Which digital video files have been withheld in their entirety and why? \r\n\r\nYou provided \u201caccess\u201d to STREAMS of \u201coriginal\u201d digital video recordings that have been edited. You are \r\ncorrect in that if I had requested to \u201cview\u201d various digital video streams, the District providing a link to \r\npublicly maintained websites to \u201cview\u201d the content of the videos would most likely satisfy such a \r\nrequest. Links to stream video files do not satisfy this public records request. \r\n\r\nThis request is and always has been for DIGITAL COPIES of the ORIGINAL DIGITAL MEDIA VIDEO FILES \r\nthemselves. Preferably unedited and unredacted except were allowed by law, each file produced in its \r\noriginal native digital media format. Delivered to the requestor via internet link or in the alternative on \r\ndata CD-ROM. \r\n\r\nIf in fact the links you have provided can provide an original copy of the original digital media video files \r\nrequested in original native digital format unedited, with the original dates of creation and file names \r\nattached, then yes I do require assistance. I am unaware as to how to receive original unedited digital \r\nvideo files from YouTube and Facebook Links.  \r\n\r\nPlease see this partial YOUTUBE Terms of Service Agreement: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms \r\n\r\n \u201c\u2026Permissions and Restrictions \r\n You may access and use the Service as made available to you, as long as you comply with \r\n this Agreement and applicable law.

To accommodate you \r\n further, I have attached a revised version of the Declaration in which that caption is removed. \r\n You may complete this version of the Declaration if you prefer.

This statement is a violation of the Public Records Act: \r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 \r\n\r\n Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records. \r\n (2) Public records shall be available for inspection and copying, and agencies shall, upon \r\n request for identifiable public records, make them promptly available to any person including, \r\n if applicable, on a partial or installment basis as records that are part of a larger set of \r\n requested records are assembled or made ready for inspection or disclosure. Agencies shall \r\n not deny a request for identifiable public records solely on the basis that the request is \r\n overbroad. Agencies shall not distinguish among persons requesting records, and such persons \r\n shall not be required to provide information as to the purpose for the request except to \r\n establish whether inspection and copying would violate RCW 42.56.070(8) or 42.56.240(14), or \r\n other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records to \r\n certain persons. \r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.070(8) \r\n\r\n This chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency, the office of the \r\n secretary of the senate, or the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives to give, \r\n sell or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes, and agencies, \r\n the office of the secretary of the senate, and the office of the chief clerk of the house of \r\n representatives shall not do so unless specifically authorized or directed by law: PROVIDED, \r\n HOWEVER, That lists of applicants for professional licenses and of professional licensees shall \r\n be made available to those professional associations or educational organizations recognized \r\n by their professional licensing or examination board, upon payment of a reasonable charge \r\n therefor: PROVIDED FURTHER, That such recognition may be refused only for a good cause \r\n pursuant to a hearing under the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative \r\n procedure act. \r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.070(8) does not apply. Digital video files are not \u201clists of individuals requested for \r\ncommercial purposes.\u201d \r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.240(14): \r\n\r\n Body worn camera recordings to the extent nondisclosure is essential for the protection of \r\n any person's right to privacy as described in RCW 42.56.050, including, but not limited to, the \r\n circumstances enumerated in (a) of this subsection. A law enforcement or corrections agency \r\n shall not disclose a body worn camera recording to the extent the recording is exempt under \r\n this subsection. \r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.240(14) does not apply. The District is not a law enforcement agency. No body worn camera \r\nvideos have been identified to date in this records request. \r\n\r\nYOU STATED: \r\n\r\n \u201cIf the District has not received a completed declaration within thirty (30) days of today\u2019s \r\n date, your request will be closed.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis District lacks the statutory authority to close this public records request without due process. Please \r\nadvise if the District has closed this records request.

I intend to assist you promptly if it is your intention to proceed in that regard. Please advise if you intend to proceed with an internal review. If so, please identify precisely the issues you wish to have reviewed by submitting a petition as described in Procedure 4040P.  I will be able to refer a petition for an internal review upon receipt of a petition.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that videos posted on the sites I have provided to you can be downloaded.

I am not aware of editing that may have been done in any of the posted videos, or how you may have formed such an opinion by viewing them. My understanding is that the posted videos are original, final records. Board of director meeting videos, for example, would not have been edited prior to being posted on BoardDocs and the District\u2019s YouTube Channel.\r\n\r\nIf in a particular case there may have been an earlier version of a posted video, it is possible that the creator may have a draft of the video, which may be exempt under RCW 42.56.280, or which may have been in the form of an informal note and not a public record.\r\n\r\nYou also inquire about the name and date of videos, and their format.

Dates of creation may be additionally stated within a video, if a video was created before it was posted. The records speak for themselves as to these questions.\r\n\r\nAs I have explained, by providing you the hundreds of videos you have been provided to date, the District is not concluding your request. Rather, the District has promptly provided to you the readily available records that exist. The District is not asserting exemptions in the videos you have been provided. The process of assembling additional videos created and maintained by individual staff persons is an enormous and lengthy task, for the reasons I have described to you.\r\n\r\nFinally, please note that it is part of the District\u2019s recordkeeping system that your PRR request number appear at the beginning of the subject line of emails pertaining to your request.

This message contains the first installment, addressing recorded \"school board meetings\" and \"classroom sessions.\"\r\n\r\nResponse with respect to video recordings of school board meetings\r\nVideos of school board meetings are posted on the District's website. You may retrieve them as follows:\r\nGo to https://bsd405.org/about/school-board/. Scroll down and select \"Go to BoardDocs.\"  In BoardDocs, select \"Meetings\" from the ribbon at top right. On the left, use the dropdown menu to select the date of meeting in which you have an interest. When you select the date of any Regular Meeting of the Board of Directors, an icon labelled \"Watch video\" will appear. In most cases, these video recordings contain audio content only. Records referred to may be viewed by clicking on the \"View the Agenda\" icon.\r\n\r\nResponse with respect to recorded classroom sessions\r\nThe District does not use \"google classroom sessions.\" Further, where students are present or referred to in any recorded classroom session, those records are fully exempt under RCW 42.56.230(1) (personal information in any files maintained for students in public schools); and under RCW 42.56.070(1) (exemptions authorized outside PRA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 USC section 1232g (education records or any personally identifiable information in education records is exempt from disclosure to third parties without adult student or parent consent).\r\n\r\nGenerally, with respect to other types of recordings\r\nPlease see the following links to the District's website, where recent District-wide town hall meetings and other types of recordings may be or may have been posted:\r\nDistrict website: https://bsd405.org/\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bsd405<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbsd405&data=04%7C01%7Cpublicrecords%40bsd405.org%7C5508a3f2a3e1401be6d008d90b411fb4%7C994a41397c06491e809879006d575de0%7C0%7C0%7C637553196587929667%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=8kzBso1VJsyXO5FMpes0bPoT7Kdu%2B4k5PyDGD0Cq13M%3D&reserved=0>\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheBSD405<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FTheBSD405&data=04%7C01%7Cpublicrecords%40bsd405.org%7C5508a3f2a3e1401be6d008d90b411fb4%7C994a41397c06491e809879006d575de0%7C0%7C0%7C637553196587939661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Nt4p%2BP29zz7Vyudzs4v8wAhoH9z3z7sgp4ZOyldfoG8%3D&reserved=0>\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bellevueschools405/<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbellevueschools405%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cpublicrecords%40bsd405.org%7C5508a3f2a3e1401be6d008d90b411fb4%7C994a41397c06491e809879006d575de0%7C0%7C0%7C637553196587939661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=UcBzaQQeyD%2BVRW2NvoEvSntMLFsa89obn403NAkwVF0%3D&reserved=0>\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\nAssembly and review work is proceeding with respect to the other types of recordings you have identified, i.e., \"internet-based video calls,\" \"meetings,\" \"training sessions,\" and \"town halls.\"  Before the District will be able to proceed, your answers to the following clarification questions will be required.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\n  1.  Some \"town halls\" are conducted at the District level and some are conducted at a school building level. The District has 29 schools, any of which may have conducted and recorded \"town halls\" with its student and parent communities. Many town hall meetings, especially at the building level, are likely to contain information protected by FERPA (cited above). Please advise if you are interested only in recordings of District-wide town hall meetings.\r\n  2.  Digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, [and] training sessions\" are not centrally maintained.  Retrieval of such recordings would require communication with approximately 2,500 District employees who may have recorded such a call, meeting, or training session. The volume of potentially responsive records may be exceedingly high and may require hundreds or thousands of hours of content review to identify exempt material. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction process may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not have the technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive scale.  Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n  3.  Digital recordings of \"training sessions\" are likely to be subject to copyright protection, and trade secret or other proprietary exemptions. A consideration of the release of such recordings would in most cases require review by the content owner or originator, to identify protected content. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction process may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not have the  technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive scale. Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n  4.  Additionally, although you state that your request is not commercial in nature, in many cases the digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions [and] town halls\" would inherently contain lists of individuals, identifiable by the fact that they would in many cases be shown as signed in to the call, meeting, training session, or town hall. Therefore, your request for such materials requires a commercial purposes inquiry. Please complete the attached Commercial Purpose Declaration within 30 days if you intend to proceed with these portions of your request. If you do not return the Declaration, your request will be closed.\r\n\r\nPlease answer these clarification questions within 30 days, that is, on or before June 2, 2021. The District's analysis and assessment of your request may result in additional clarification questions.\r\nIf additional materials are identified that can be disclosed to you, subject to the issues expressed in the clarification questions above, I estimate July 15 as a tentative next installment date. However, that estimate may have to be altered, depending on your answers to the clarification questions above.\r\nI am glad to assist you if you wish to discuss.\r\nFinally, it is possible that there may be a delay in our communications due to firewalls in the District's email system that flag emails that appear to be spam or solicitations. In my experience, that can be remedied by the identification of a named sender. Please consider providing a named sender (in some way that will protect your anonymity, if you still wish to preserve it) if that appears to be a problem (e.g., in why you apparently thought the District received your request on April 22, when in fact it was received on April 25, a weekend day, and was deemed received on April 26).\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Records referred to may be viewed by clicking on the \u201cView the Agenda\u201d icon.\r\n\r\nResponse: Thank you.\r\n\r\nWith respect to recorded classroom sessions\r\n\r\nThe District does not use \"google classroom sessions.\" Further, where students are present orreferred to in any recorded classroom session, those records are fully exempt under RCW 42.56.230(1) (personal information in any files maintained for students in public schools); and under RCW 42.56.070(1) (exemptions authorized outside PRA) and the Family Educational Rights \tand Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 USC section 1232g (education records or any personally identifiable information in education records is exempt from disclosure to third parties without \tadult student or parent consent).\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n\r\nWith all due respect, while digital video recordings where students are present or referred to certainly could be wholly exempt from disclosure to third parties, this is certainly not always going to be the case. Public records act exemptions are subject to very specific State and Federal statutes and circumstances. \r\n\r\nThe request for copies of any digital video recordings of classroom sessions for the requested period of time is not necessarily exempt in whole. The District has the responsibility to search for digital video recordings of classroom sessions and then redact student information where appropriate under statute, then producing the remainder of the non-exempt record or in this matter digital video file.\r\n\r\nQuite probably digital video recordings wholly or partially redacted by the District based on specific exemptions would still provide the requestor the name of the video file, the date and time of the recording, the length of the recording, the place of recording, the method of recording, the storage location of the digital video file itself, metadata not subject to redaction, and more. \r\n\r\nFrom the BELLEVUE SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 Public Records Request Website:\r\n\r\nhttps://bsd405.org/departments/records/public-records/\r\n\r\n\u201cIf the record requested for inspection and/or copying contains both information exempted from disclosure and nonexempt information, the District will produce as much of the record as possible, with the exempt portion redacted, and will provide a written explanation for the redaction.\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease search for and provide digital video recordings of classroom sessions and redact where appropriate.\r\n \r\nGenerally, with respect to other types of recordings\r\n\r\nPlease see the following links to the District's website, where recent District-wide town hall \tmeetings and other types of recordings may be or may have been posted Facebook, Twitter, \tand Instagram <links omitted>\r\n\r\nResponse:  Thank you.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\nAssembly and review work is proceeding with respect to the other types of recordings \tyou \thave identified, i.e., \"internet-based video calls,\" \"meetings,\" \"training sessions,\" and \t\"town \thalls.\" Before the District will be able to proceed, your answers to the following clarification questions will be required.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\n\r\n1. Some \"town halls\" are conducted at the District level and some are conducted at a school building level. The District has 29 schools, any of which may have conducted and recorded \"town halls\" with its student and parent communities. Many town hall meetings, especially at the building level, are likely to contain information protected by FERPA (cited above). Please advise if you are interested only in recordings of District-wide town hall meetings.\r\n\r\nAgain, please refer to my response regarding the production of digital video recordings of classroom sessions and Bellevue School District policy regarding providing as much of the record as possible, with the exempt portions redacted, and then providing a written explanation for any redactions.\r\n\r\nI am requesting all digital video recordings for the time period specified.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n2. Digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, [and] training sessions\" are not centrally maintained. Retrieval of such recordings would require communication with approximately 2,500 District employees who may have recorded such a call, meeting, or training session. The volume of potentially responsive records may be exceedingly high and may require hundreds or thousands of hours of content review to identify exempt material. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction \tprocess may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not \thave the technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive \tscale. Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate the District has chosen not to centrally maintain digital video recordings subject to public record requests. It may be prudent for the District to draft policy (should no policy currently be in place) governing the approximately 2,500 District employees who are directed or may choose to produce digital video recordings subject to public records requests.\r\n\r\nAs you know under the Public Records Act, agencies cannot charge for the time staff time spend locating a public record or making it available for inspection (including any time spent reviewing or redacting records).\r\nThe Bellevue School Board found that it would be \u201cunduly burdensome to calculate the actual costs of providing copies of public records, given the multiple electronic and manual devices used to do so, as well as the fluctuating costs of District supplies, equipment, and labor.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the District adopted the \u201cStatutory default cost\u201d option for calculating fees:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe District has determined it will not calculate actual costs for copying records for the reasons \tset forth in Policy 4040. The District will apply the fees and costs as authorized in RCW 42.56.120 \tand as published in the agency's fee schedule.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe fees for production of digital video recordings under the statutory default cost option are as follows:\r\n\r\nElectronic Documents: $0.05 per every four electronic files and/or email.\r\nTransmission of electronic records: $0.10 per gigabyte.\r\n\r\nA 1 Hour time length digital video recording of a ZOOM online video meeting results in a digital video file of approximately 1.2 gigabytes in size. Using these approximate calculations (4) 1-hour digital video recordings (1.2 Gb in size) produced by the district would generate fees of (4 files) x (.05) x (.10) = .60 or 60 cents. The fees may be marginally higher should the District choose to produce the requested files on CD-ROM. The District may charge the requestor for the cost of the CD-ROM itself as well as any postage. \r\n\r\nIf in the regular course of agency business the District and it\u2019s approximately 2,500 public employees have the technological capability to record and store digital videos on publicly owned computers and devices, the District certainly has the staff and technological ability to produce these digital videos subject to the Public Records Act. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question \u201cPlease clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request\u201d I do continue to seek such records. I have specified the records requested for a specific time period in my original public records request.\r\n\r\nFor efficiencies sake I would suggest the District designate a central digital repository on District computer servers to store all digital video files subject to public record requests and then to instruct all District employees to upload any digital video recordings for the requested time period to the designated central digital repository for review and production under the PRA. \r\n\r\nOf course recording, storing, and digitally transmitting digital video files is not technologically complicated and also comprises a regular function of various District employees on a daily basis. \r\n\r\n3. Digital recordings of \"training sessions\" are likely to be subject to copyright protection, and trade secret or other proprietary exemptions. A consideration of the release of such recordings would in most cases require review by the content owner or originator, to identify protected content. If exemptions apply, a technologically complicated and extremely time-consuming redaction process may be required, for which you would likely have to pay, because the District does not have the technological and staff resources to perform such redactions, especially on a massive scale. Please clarify whether you will continue to seek such records, and, if so, specify your request, e.g., by type of content, dates, or originator, so that the District can efficiently provide you with information that is in fact meaningful to you.\r\n\r\nCopyright is subject to certain limited exemptions and the District should redact accordingly. I do continue to seek these records. Please see my earlier responses.\r\n\r\n4. Additionally, although you state that your request is not commercial in nature, in many cases the digital recordings of \"internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions [and] town halls\" would inherently contain lists of individuals, identifiable by the fact that they would in many cases be shown as signed in to the call, meeting, training session, or town hall. Therefore, your request for such materials requires a commercial purposes inquiry. Please complete the attached Commercial Purpose Declaration within 30 days if you intend to proceed with these portions of your request. If you do not return the Declaration, your \trequest will be closed.\r\n\r\nResponse regarding your commercial purpose inquiry and declaration:\r\n\r\nThe PRA prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). Digital video recordings by their very nature do not contain an electronic record that can be sorted as could an Excel spreadsheet or Word document. I renew my declaration contained in my original public records request:  I am not seeking a list of any kind, nor a list of individuals or businesses.\r\n\r\nIn my original public records request I specifically declared the request was not being made for commercial purposes, a requirement of the Public Records Act. I incorporate by reference my original public records request and declaration dated 4-22-21:\r\n\r\n\u201cRequest for digital copies of all internet video call recordings in the District's care, custody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21 (Bellevue School District).\u201d\r\n\r\nThis declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response to your requests for clarification. \r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings.\r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nFrom: Bellevue School District\r\n05/07/2021\r\n\r\nPRR 04262021-Anon-Muckrock\r\nDear Requestor:\r\nThank you for that prompt response.

In my previous response to you I was simply making a suggestion as to how (in my personal opinion) the District could more efficiently process digital video recordings as public records. The District is under no obligation to create a central repository for digital video recordings and I am not requesting the District do so.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if you would like to amend your request in order to avoid or reduce the cost of a\r\ncustomized service charge.\r\n\r\nResponse: As I stated earlier, no customized service charge is warranted for this public records request for digital video recordings.

Please complete the\r\nCommercial Purpose Declaration, which I have again attached for your reference, by June 2,\r\n2021.\r\n\r\nResponse: You are correct, nothing in RCW 42.56.070(8) states a list must be in Excel or a sortable\r\nformat. I was only attempting to provide an example of what the courts and Washington State Statute\r\nhas defined as a \u201clist\u201d under RCW 42.56.070(8). In any event, the application of RCW 42.56.070(8)\r\nconcerns a public records request seeking a \u201clist\u201d of natural individuals.\r\n\r\nWith all due respect, the names of participants displayed in a digital video recording is not a \u201clist\u201d as\r\ndefined by RCW 42.56.070(8):\r\n\u201cThis chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency, the office of the secretary of the senate, or the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives to give, sell or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes, and agencies, the office of the secretary of the senate, and the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives shall not do so unless specifically authorized or directed by law: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That lists of applicants for professional licenses and of professional licensees shall be made available to those professional associations or educational organizations recognized by their professional licensing or examination board, upon payment of a reasonable charge therefor: PROVIDED FURTHER, That such recognition may be refused only for a good cause pursuant to a hearing under the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative procedure act.\u201d\r\n\r\nJust as an email or any other document also not a \u201clist,\u201d the District has the option to redact any names that might be displayed in a digital video recording based on a valid exemption should there be one.\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Purpose Declaration form (affidavit) which you have provided titled \u201cREQUEST FOR\r\nLIST OF NAMES\u201d does not apply to this Public Records request as no list of names was requested in the original public records request and the District has the option to redact any responsive videos files produced under the law.\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\nFrom: Muckrock Staff\r\n05/25/2021 \r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nI wanted to follow up on the following Washington Public Records Act request, copied below, and originally submitted on April 22, 2021.

You cannot walk in off the street into a parent or student meeting with a teacher, or into a classroom of students.  Similarly, you are not entitled to the content of digital video calls with parents or students, or to the content of a remotely conducted  classroom.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if the extensive records you have been provided are sufficient for your purposes.\r\n\r\nAs set forth in my message to you dated May 3, 2021, a next phase of records production would require disruptive and time-consuming recovery from individual employees, added storage capacity, extensive and time-consuming copying of recorded video into redactable formats and/or for the purpose of creating a copy for redaction, and review, analysis, and anticipated redaction of exempt material. This is likely to require the purchase of hardware and software that is not presently available to nor within the technical expertise of staff that responds to public records. As I have advised you, the District is evaluating the costs of customized service charges that would be associated with those purchases and tasks. The copying is likely to require software and hardware purchases, training, and added staff. There may also be additional costs of storage devices and data transmission for which you would be responsible.\r\n\r\nIf you require additional records, I estimate a next installment in response to your request will be September 23, 2021. This estimate considers the factors described above, as well as the fact that many of the staff from whom such records would be assembled will soon be leaving for the summer break.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the District cannot proceed further until it receives and has evaluated a completed and signed Commercial Purpose Declaration, for the reasons that have been explained to you.

Also, the links do not provide information about what digital video files have been produced, and which have been withheld in their entirety, nor which digital video files have been edited and for what reason.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, this public records request is seeking digital copies of specific digital media files, not links to stream partial content of the original files without a detailed exemption log explaining what has been withheld and why.\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\t\r\n\u201cPlease advise if the extensive records you have been provided are sufficient for your \tpurposes.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\nHyperbole aside, no requested records (digital media files) have been produced.

The copying is likely to require software and hardware purchases, training, and added staff. There  may also be additional costs of storage devices and data transmission for which you would be \tresponsible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nThe District\u2019s responsibilities under the Public Records Act are clear. To address your comments point by point: \r\n\r\n\u201cdisruptive and time-consuming recovery from individual employees\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease see WAC 44-14-04003(3) \u201cThe agency should recognize that fulfilling public records requests is one of the agency's duties, along with its others.\u201d These public employees created digital video files that are now public record. It is certainly not \u201cdisruptive\u201d for public employees to produce identifiable public records.\r\n\r\n\u201cadded storage capacity\u201d\r\n\r\nQuestion: Why the need for added storage capacity? Regardless, irrelevant under the Public Records Act.\r\n\r\n\u201cextensive and time-consuming copying of recorded video into redactable formats and/or for the purpose of creating a copy for redaction\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain, irrelevant. All costs of preparation for responsive documents and any redactions if required is the sole responsibility of the District. No costs for collation or redaction may be passed on to the original requestor under the act. See WAC 44-14-07001:\r\n\r\n\tWAC 44-14-07001 General rules for charging for copies.\r\n\t(1) No fees for costs of locating records or preparing records for inspection or copying. An \tagency cannot charge a fee for locating public records or for preparing the records for \tinspection or copying. RCW 42.56.120.1 An agency cannot charge fees for a person to inspect or \taccess records on the agency's public internet web site. An agency cannot charge a fee for \taccess to or downloading records the agency routinely posts on its public internet web site prior \tto the receipt of a request unless the requestor has specifically requested that the agency \tprovide copies of such records through other means. RCW 42.56.120 (2)(e).\r\n\r\n\tAn agency cannot charge a \"redaction fee\" for the staff time necessary to prepare the records \tfor inspection, for the copying required to redact records before they are inspected, or an \tarchive fee for getting the records from off-site. Op. Att'y Gen. 6 (1991). These are the costs of \tmaking the records available for inspection or copying and cannot be charged to the requestor.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is likely to require the purchase of hardware and software that is not presently available  to nor within the technical expertise of staff that responds to public records.\u201d\r\n\r\nUntrue  however if so, also irrelevant. As clearly stated, the District cannot assess fees for costs of locating records or preparing records for inspection or copying. The District is in possession of public records in the form of digital media files. These public records have been identified and requested per the Public Records Act and the District is required to produce these records in compliance with the act.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I have advised you, the District is evaluating the costs of customized service charges that would be associated with those purchases and tasks. The copying is likely to require software and hardware purchases, training, and added staff. There may also be additional costs of storage devices and data transmission for which you would be responsible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nAs I requested previously, please provide a detailed accounting of the customized service charge the District believes applies to this public records request. I believe once the District produces a detailed record of any proposed customized service charge it will be simple to demonstrate the District is in error, and no customized service charge applies to this public records request under the PRA (RCW 42.56).\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you require additional records, I estimate a next installment in response to your request will be September 23, 2021. This estimate considers the factors described above, as well as the fact that many of the staff from whom such records would be assembled will soon be leaving for the summer break.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nAs I previously stated, no requested records have been produced by the District to date, and my previous request for the District to provide a detailed accounting of any proposed customized service charge is still outstanding. District staff vacations do not relieve the District of its responsibilities under the public records act. \r\n\r\nAdditionally the District should advise all employees, volunteers, contractors, and any other 3rd parties who may have care, custody, or control of any digital video files originally requested in PRR 04262021 to preserve these public records until this request is resolved. \r\n\r\nPlease consider WAC 44-14-04003(9) as constructive notice:\r\n\t\u201cWAC 44-14-04003(9) Preserving requested records. If a requested record is scheduled shortly \tfor destruction, and the agency receives a public records request for it, the record cannot be \tdestroyed until the request is resolved. RCW 42.56.100.8 Once a request has been closed, the \tagency can destroy the requested records in accordance with its retention schedule.\u201d\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\t\u201cAdditionally, the District cannot proceed further until it receives and has evaluated a completed and signed Commercial Purpose Declaration, for the reasons that have been explained to you. The Declaration is due on or before June 2, 2021.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nI previously addressed your multiple requests for a signed \u201cREQUEST FOR LIST OF NAMES\u201d document. \r\n\r\nDigital video files are not a \u201clist\u201d as defined in RCW 42.56.070(8).\r\n\r\nThe Commercial Purpose Declaration form (affidavit) which you have provided titled \u201cREQUEST FOR LIST OF NAMES\u201d does not apply to this Public Records request as no list of names was requested in the original public records request and the District has the option to redact any names that might be displayed as a list in any digital video recording based on a valid exemption should there be one.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Is it the District\u2019s position that PRR 04262021 \u2013 this request for copies of digital video files will not proceed without the requestor signing the District\u2019s \u201cREQUEST FOR LIST OF NAMES\u201d document?\r\n\r\nAt this point it certainly appears that the District is not applying a good faith interpretation of the statues governing public records, nor providing \u201cfullest assistance\" and \"most timely possible action\" (WAC 44-14-04003(3)) in processing PRR 04262021.\r\n\r\nThe District is constructively denying the processing of this public records request. I formally request an immediate denial review of PRR 04262021 by District legal counsel. If in a reasonable amount of time a denial review by the District does not provide the relief requested, I reserve the right under RCW 42.56.550 to seek Judicial review of the District\u2019s position in Superior Court.\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Bellevue School District\r\n06/01/2021\r\n\r\nPRR 04262021-Anon-Muckrock\r\nDear Requestor:\r\nOn May 29, you appear to object, for the first time, following the District\u2019s first installment to you dated May 3, 2021, and its second installment to you dated May 27, 2021, that you are not able to retrieve digital video recordings that you have requested, which are posted on the District\u2019s public sites at the links that have been provided to you. You state, \u201cThe various links you have provided do not contain any digital copies of the video recordings originally requested.\u201d That is not correct. You have been provided with access to hundreds of original digital video recordings that are responsive to your request.\r\nReferring a requestor by means of a link to an agency\u2019s publicly maintained webpage or website, on which requested records are or may be posted, is an appropriate manner in which to respond to a public records request.\r\nI do not understand your objection in this regard. If you need assistance retrieving the digital video recordings posted on the sites to which I have provided links, please advise.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Commercial Purposes Declaration, you have pointed out that it contained a caption, \u201cRequest for List of Names.\u201d I offered to you the option of striking out that caption, and initialing your strikeout, if you believed the caption did not apply. To accommodate you further, I have attached a revised version of the Declaration in which that caption is removed. You may complete this version of the Declaration if you prefer. I will extend the due date for returning the Declaration, for your convenience, to June 8, 2021.\r\nAs you acknowledged on May 10, there is nothing in RCW 42.56.070(8) that states that a list is defined as one in Excel or another sortable format. A request that seeks a list of individuals is subject to an inquiry under RCW 42.56.080(2). The names of participants in many digital recordings are shown within the recording. For that reason, it is appropriate for the District to conduct an inquiry under RCW 42.56.080(2).\r\n\r\nI have not represented that the District does not intend to produce additional records. To the contrary, I have appropriately informed you of the estimated timeframe for producing such records, and have explained the factors affecting that estimate.\r\nAs earlier noted, the District is evaluating a customized service charge.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

The petition shall include a copy of or reasonably identify the written statement by the Public Records Officer or designee denying the request.\r\nConsideration of Petition for Review\r\nThe Public Records Officer shall promptly refer the petition to a District official designated to conduct the review, who will immediately consider the petition and either affirm or reverse the denial within two business days following the District\u2019s receipt of the petition, or within such other time to which the District and the requestor mutually agree.\r\n\r\nIf you intend to request an internal review, you may petition in writing under Procedure 4040P. \u201cThe petition shall include a copy of or reasonably identify the written statement by the Public Records Officer or designee denying the request.\u201d\r\n\r\nYour request has not been denied. You have been provided access to hundreds of digital copies of video recordings as you requested. Also, you have been provided with an estimated date of September 23, 2021 for a third installment.\r\n\r\nIf your request for a review under Procedure 4040P is intended to address the question of the District\u2019s inquiry as to a commercial purpose under RCW 42.56.080(2), please identify that issue in the petition.\r\nIt is the District\u2019s position that it has the right and statutory obligation under RCW 42.56.080(2) to conduct such an inquiry with respect to your request. The Declaration forms you have been provided explain the statutory basis for this obligation. Until you submit a completed and signed Commercial Purposes Declaration, and the District has completed its inquiry, the District will not be able to proceed to process additional potentially responsive recordings. The reason for this is that additional potentially responsive recordings may contain auditory and/or visual lists of individuals. In order to properly respond further to your request, and to avoid duplicative review and processing, the District needs to complete its inquiry as to whether your request has a commercial purpose.\r\n\r\nPlease advise whether you will complete the Commercial Purposes Declaration provided to you earlier today, as revised (attached), by the extended deadline of June 8, 2021.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

You state, \u201cThe various links \r\n you have provided do not contain any digital copies of the video recordings originally \r\n requested.\u201d That is not correct. You have been provided with access to hundreds of original \r\n digital video recordings that are responsive to your request. \r\n Referring a requestor by means of a link to an agency\u2019s publicly maintained webpage or \r\n website, on which requested records are or may be posted, is an appropriate manner in which \r\n to respond to a public records request. \r\n I do not understand your objection in this regard. If you need assistance retrieving the digital \r\n video recordings posted on the sites to which I have provided links, please advise.\u201d \r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE: \r\n\r\nYou provided links to STREAM or VIEW digital videos online. I have requested COPIES of the digital video \r\nmedia files themselves. The links you have sent to not provide a digital copy of the original video, which \r\nis what was originally requested. \r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia on the nature of Streaming Media: \r\n\r\n Streaming media is multimedia that is delivered and consumed in a continuous manner \r\n from a source, with little or no intermediate storage in network elements. Streaming refers to \r\n the delivery method of content, rather than the content itself. \r\n\r\n Streaming is an alternative to file downloading, a process in which the end-user obtains the \r\n entire file for the content before watching or listening to it. \r\n\r\nThe links you provided to STREAM the digital video files all stream videos that appear to have been \r\nedited. What content has been edited from the original videos? What are the file names of each digital \r\nvideo file? When was each digital file created? In what format was each digital video file stored? Why \r\nhave you not provided exemption logs explaining what content was redacted or edited from each digital \r\nmedia file and why? Which digital video files have been withheld in their entirety and why? \r\n\r\nYou provided \u201caccess\u201d to STREAMS of \u201coriginal\u201d digital video recordings that have been edited. You are \r\ncorrect in that if I had requested to \u201cview\u201d various digital video streams, the District providing a link to \r\npublicly maintained websites to \u201cview\u201d the content of the videos would most likely satisfy such a \r\nrequest. Links to stream video files do not satisfy this public records request. \r\n\r\nThis request is and always has been for DIGITAL COPIES of the ORIGINAL DIGITAL MEDIA VIDEO FILES \r\nthemselves. Preferably unedited and unredacted except were allowed by law, each file produced in its \r\noriginal native digital media format. Delivered to the requestor via internet link or in the alternative on \r\ndata CD-ROM. \r\n\r\nIf in fact the links you have provided can provide an original copy of the original digital media video files \r\nrequested in original native digital format unedited, with the original dates of creation and file names \r\nattached, then yes I do require assistance. I am unaware as to how to receive original unedited digital \r\nvideo files from YouTube and Facebook Links.  \r\n\r\nPlease see this partial YOUTUBE Terms of Service Agreement: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms \r\n\r\n \u201c\u2026Permissions and Restrictions \r\n You may access and use the Service as made available to you, as long as you comply with \r\n this Agreement and applicable law.

RCW 42.56.070(8).\u201d \r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE: \r\n\r\nI have requested no list of individuals and this public records request is not for commercial purposes. \r\nRCW 42.56.080(2): \r\n\r\n \u201d The Public Records Act expressly authorizes an agency to inquire as to a requestor\u2019s purpose \r\n when necessary, to determine whether the requestor is seeking a list of individuals for \r\n commercial purposes.

Agencies shall \r\n not deny a request for identifiable public records solely on the basis that the request is \r\n overbroad. Agencies shall not distinguish among persons requesting records, and such persons \r\n shall not be required to provide information as to the purpose for the request except to \r\n establish whether inspection and copying would violate RCW 42.56.070(8) or 42.56.240(14), or \r\n other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records to \r\n certain persons. \r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.070(8) \r\n\r\n This chapter shall not be construed as giving authority to any agency, the office of the \r\n secretary of the senate, or the office of the chief clerk of the house of representatives to give, \r\n sell or provide access to lists of individuals requested for commercial purposes, and agencies, \r\n the office of the secretary of the senate, and the office of the chief clerk of the house of \r\n representatives shall not do so unless specifically authorized or directed by law: PROVIDED, \r\n HOWEVER, That lists of applicants for professional licenses and of professional licensees shall \r\n be made available to those professional associations or educational organizations recognized \r\n by their professional licensing or examination board, upon payment of a reasonable charge \r\n therefor: PROVIDED FURTHER, That such recognition may be refused only for a good cause \r\n pursuant to a hearing under the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative \r\n procedure act. \r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.070(8) does not apply.

A law enforcement or corrections agency \r\n shall not disclose a body worn camera recording to the extent the recording is exempt under \r\n this subsection. \r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.240(14) does not apply.

For that \r\n reason, it is appropriate for the District to conduct an inquiry under RCW 42.56.080(2).\u201d \r\n\r\nMy answer to the District\u2019s inquiry: I have requested no list of individuals for a commercial purpose. No \r\nportion of this public records request seeks a list of individuals and no portion of this public records \r\nrequest is for a commercial purpose of any kind. \r\n\r\nThis records request is for \u201cdigital copies of all internet video call recordings in the District's care, \r\ncustody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21\u201d requests digital copies of \r\nspecific identifiable and subsequently identified public records.  \r\n\r\nIt is in the best interests of the public that the District preserve all digital video file public records \r\nrequested, and provide copies of these public records as requested as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nFrom: Bellevue School District\r\n06/04/2021 \r\n\r\nPRR 04262021-Anon-Muckrock\r\nDear Requestor:\r\nYou do not address in your response below my second email to you on June 1 at 5:17 PM Pacific Time with respect to your request for an internal review of your request under Procedure 4040P. I intend to assist you promptly if it is your intention to proceed in that regard. Please advise if you intend to proceed with an internal review. If so, please identify precisely the issues you wish to have reviewed by submitting a petition as described in Procedure 4040P.  I will be able to refer a petition for an internal review upon receipt of a petition.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that videos posted on the sites I have provided to you can be downloaded.  I will check further on that with our IT Department and advise further.\r\n\r\nYou state, \u201cYou provided \u201caccess\u201d to STREAMS of \u201coriginal\u201d digital video recordings that have been edited.\u201d (Emphasis in your text.) I am not aware of editing that may have been done in any of the posted videos, or how you may have formed such an opinion by viewing them. My understanding is that the posted videos are original, final records. Board of director meeting videos, for example, would not have been edited prior to being posted on BoardDocs and the District\u2019s YouTube Channel.\r\n\r\nIf in a particular case there may have been an earlier version of a posted video, it is possible that the creator may have a draft of the video, which may be exempt under RCW 42.56.280, or which may have been in the form of an informal note and not a public record.\r\n\r\nYou also inquire about the name and date of videos, and their format. The name and date of posting are viewable in the platforms to which you have been given access. Dates of creation may be additionally stated within a video, if a video was created before it was posted. The records speak for themselves as to these questions.\r\n\r\nAs I have explained, by providing you the hundreds of videos you have been provided to date, the District is not concluding your request. Rather, the District has promptly provided to you the readily available records that exist. The District is not asserting exemptions in the videos you have been provided. The process of assembling additional videos created and maintained by individual staff persons is an enormous and lengthy task, for the reasons I have described to you.\r\n\r\nFinally, please note that it is part of the District\u2019s recordkeeping system that your PRR request number appear at the beginning of the subject line of emails pertaining to your request. In some of my reply correspondence to you, your subject line has been too long to permit the PRR number to be inserted, so I have had to delete or truncate some of your subject line. I would appreciate it if you can shorten your subject line in some manner and include the PRR number in all of your correspondence to this office.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A. Boyer\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nBellevue School District No. 405\r\npublicrecords@bsd405.org<mailto:publicrecords@bsd405.org>\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nFrom: Anon Request\r\n06/14/2021 \r\n\r\n\r\nSubject: PRR 04262021\r\n\r\nJune 14, 2021\r\n\r\nHello Ms. Boyer,\r\n\r\nThank you for your communications dated 6-4-21.\r\n\r\nMy response is as follows:\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\t\r\n\u201cDear Requestor:\r\n\r\nYou do not address in your response below my second email to you on June 1 at 5:17 PM Pacific Time with respect to your request for an internal review of your request under Procedure 4040P. I intend to assist you promptly if it is your intention to proceed in that regard. Please advise if you intend to proceed with an internal review. If so, please identify precisely the issues you wish to have reviewed by submitting a petition as described in Procedure 4040P. I will be able to refer a petition for an internal review upon receipt of a petition.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that videos posted on the sites I have provided to you can be downloaded. I will check further on that with our IT Department and advise further.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nI request an internal review per Procedure No. 4040P - Public Access to District Records. My petition for internal review follows at the end of this communication.\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou state, \u201cYou provided \u201caccess\u201d to STREAMS of \u201coriginal\u201d digital video recordings that have been edited.\u201d (Emphasis in your text.) I am not aware of editing that may have been done in any of the posted videos, or how you may have formed such an opinion by viewing them. My understanding is that the posted videos are original, final records. Board of director meeting videos, for example, would not have been edited prior to being posted on BoardDocs and the District\u2019s YouTube Channel.\r\n\r\nIf in a particular case there may have been an earlier version of a posted video, it is possible that the creator may have a draft of the video, which may be exempt under RCW 42.56.280, or which may have been in the form of an informal note and not a public record.\r\nYou also inquire about the name and date of videos, and their format. The name and date of posting are viewable in the platforms to which you have been given access. Dates of creation may be additionally stated within a video, if a video was created before it was posted. The records speak for themselves as to these questions.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nTo date you have provided zero requested records. No exemption logs of records you allege to have produced have been provided. No digital copies of any digital videos requested have been provided. \r\nYou have provided links to the following 3rd party services, none of which provide digital copies of the digital video files requested:\r\n\r\nFACEBOOK\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/bsd405\r\n \r\nNO ACCESS. NO DIGITAL VIDEO FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD.\r\n\r\nINSTAGRAM \r\n\r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/bellevueschools405/\r\n\r\nNO ACCESS. NO DIGITAL VIDEO FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD.\r\n\r\nTWITTER\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/TheBSD405\r\n\r\nNO DIGITAL VIDEO FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD.\r\n\r\nYOUTUBE\r\n \r\nNO ACCESS. NO DIGITAL VIDEO FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD.\r\n\r\nBOARDDOCS\u00ae A DILIGENT BRAND, \u00a9 2002-2021\r\n\r\nDistrict website: https://bsd405.org/\r\n \r\nNO DIGITAL VIDEO FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD.\r\n\r\nAgain, none of the requested records have been provided. No exemption logs have been provided.\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\u201cAs I have explained, by providing you the hundreds of videos you have been provided to date, the District is not concluding your request. Rather, the District has promptly provided to you the readily available records that exist. The District is not asserting exemptions in the videos you have been provided. The process of assembling additional videos created and maintained by individual staff persons is an enormous and lengthy task, for the reasons I have described to you.\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nNo requested records have been provided. No exemption logs have been provided. The process of locating and providing copies of the digital video files originally requested (public records that have been properly identified under the PRA) is the legal obligation and responsibility of the District. Continuing to argue and object about the scope of the task is prohibited by the Public Records Act. \r\nThis public records request is not vague, nor overly broad in nature. \r\n\r\nThis public records request is for identifiable records.\r\n\r\nThis public records request does not seek records extraordinary in nature, nor does the request seek a complication of records to be produced, nor does the request seek a list or lists of any kind. \r\nThis public records request is in the best interest of the general public.\r\n\r\nThe District has the option to produce the public records in installments over time.\r\n\r\nTo date, the District has not produced a single record, nor has the District produced an exemption log of any kind.\r\n\r\nYOU STATED:\r\n\r\n\u201cFinally, please note that it is part of the District\u2019s recordkeeping system that your PRR request number appear at the beginning of the subject line of emails pertaining to your request. In some of my reply correspondence to you, your subject line has been too long to permit the PRR number to be inserted, so I have had to delete or truncate some of your subject line. I would appreciate it if you can shorten your subject line in some manner and include the PRR number in all of your correspondence to this office.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A. Boyer\r\nPublic Records Officer\r\nBellevue School District No. 405\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\nI am not sure I understand what you are asking, however I will endeavor to do my best in assisting you with your internal record keeping if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETITION FOR INTERNAL REVIEW [THIS PETITION]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nTHIS CONCLUDES MY PETITION FOR INTERNAL REVIEW re: Procedure No. 4040P - Public Access to District Records\r\n\r\nThis concludes my response.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the District production of non-exempt digital video recordings as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.",

My understanding is that Facebook and Instagram may require that you sign in to gain access.\r\nI understand that you have been able to view but not download copies of records from the links provided to you to District's YouTube site, the District's website, the BoardDocs page within the District's website, and the District's Twitter account, and for that reason you are asking for copies of video recordings. Please confirm whether my understandings are correct.\r\n\r\nThe next estimated installment date, as set forth to you in my message dated May 27, 2021, is September 23, 2021. Your request will be completed in a series of installments. The particular factors pertaining to your request that affect the next estimated installment date have been explained to you, with respect to what is reasonable and technologically feasible for the District. Those factors will continue to be assessed. Additional factors affecting that estimated date include the fact that the public records office is presently responding to multiple requests, a number of which were received before yours; the volume of potentially responsive records; the technological complexity of your request; and the workload of this department and of multiple other staff persons whose assistance is needed in processing your request. The estimate may also be affected by the conditions of working remotely in the present public health circumstances, and unanticipated events or conditions, such as emergency projects or technology limitations.\r\nIf it is possible to provide additional records to you earlier than the September 23, 2021 estimate, it will be done.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

My understanding is \tthat Facebook and Instagram may require that you sign in to gain access.\r\n\t\r\nI understand that you have been able to view but not download copies of records from the \tlinks provided to you to District's YouTube site, the District's website, the BoardDocs page \twithin the District's website, and the District's Twitter account, and for that reason you are \tasking for copies of video recordings. Please confirm whether my understandings are correct.\u201d\r\n\r\nMY RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nI have not requested identifiable public records from Facebook, Instagram, or any party not subject to the Washington State Public Records Act RCW 42.56. I have identified and requested digital copies of specific video recordings in the care, custody, or control of the Bellevue School District, a Washington State Public Agency. Copies of these digital video recordings were requested to be produced by the District via direct internet download link, email, or cd-rom.\r\n\r\nRegarding the links provided to the District's YouTube site, the District's website, the BoardDocs page within the District's website, and the District's Twitter account, these links do not provide direct download access to the digital video recordings originally requested. \r\n\r\nTo \u201ccorrect your understanding\u201d the original public records request dated 04-26-2021 specifically requested the following:\r\n\r\n\u201cDigital copies of all video recordings of internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions, town halls, school board meetings, and google classroom sessions in the District's care, custody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, if the District is in possession of any digital recordings of Zoom meeting calls, Skype Sessions, Google Duo calls, Slack, Gotomeeting, etc. (any recorded internet-based video communication/presentation/instruction product) for the period of time 01-01-20 through 4-22-21 I am requesting a digital copy to be produced via internet web link.\r\n\r\nThe District search for these digitally recorded videos should include all computers and digital storage devices owned, operated, or controlled by the District.\r\n\r\nThe District search for these digitally recorded videos should also include a search of all computers and digital storage devices owned, operated, or controlled by District employees if the digital video was recorded on equipment provided to the employee by the District, or if the digital video recording contains content relating to District agency related matters.\r\n\r\nI request the digital video files to be delivered unedited whenever possible and in the original format in which the files were digitally recorded and stored.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by internet web link or e-mail attachment if available or by CD-ROM if not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.",

Hoppe, 90 Wn.2d 123, 132, 580 P.2d 246 (1978) and WAC 44-14-04004 - Responsibilities of agency in providing records.\r\n\r\nI hope on 12.1.21 the most resent District quoted installment date the District begins to provide a first installment of COPIES of the public record digital video files originally requested on 04.25.21. \r\n\r\nThank you.",

If this is installment #3 please provide installments #1 and #2. \r\n\r\nQuestions regarding exemptions in this installment:\r\n\r\nThe exemption log you provided noted that eight (8) video files were withheld in their entirety based on exemption codes 1A (RCW 42.56.230(1), RCW 42.56.070(1), AND 20 USC \u00a7 1232g) and 10A (RCW 42.56.070(1),20 USC \u00a7 1232g,26 USC \u00a7 1603,RCW 82.32.330, RCW 84.08.2103) RCW 70.02.020(1).220-.260,42 USC \u00a7 1320d, 45 CFR Part 160.103, 45 CFR Part 164.104(b),Chapter 19.108 RCW, RCW 4.24.611(3),RCW 51.28.070,RCW 51.36.060, United States \r\nConstitution, Washington State Constitution). \r\n\r\nI object to the District's withholding of these video files in their entirety. These (8) video files are NOT entirely exempt, only portions of these video files may be. The District bears the responsibility to redact portions of these files where necessary and then provide the nonexempt portion of the video files as originally requested.\r\n\r\nPlease see:\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-04004  Responsibilities of agency in providing records.\r\n\r\n(4) Failure to provide records. A \"denial\" of a request can occur when an agency: Fails to respond to a request; Claims an exemption of the entire record or a portion of it; Without justification, fails to provide the record after the reasonable estimate of time to respond expires;\r\n\r\n(5) Claiming exemptions.\r\n\r\n(a) Redactions. If a portion of a record is exempt from disclosure, but the remainder is not, an agency generally is required to redact (black out) the exempt portion and then provide the remainder. RCW 42.56.210(1). Withholding an entire record where only a portion of it is exempt violates the act.\r\n\r\nSeattle Firefighters Union Local No. 27 v. Hollister, 48 Wn. App. 129, 132, 737 P.2d 1302 (1987).\r\n\r\nPlease redact as allowed by law and produce the non-exempt portions of the (8) video files the District has withheld in their entirety.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

        "communication": "PRR 04262021-Anon-MuckRock\r\nDear Requestor:\r\nI appreciate that you may wish your request could be completed more quickly. I share that goal with you.\r\nPlease let me explain some background that I hope will help you have realistic expectations so that you will not become frustrated.\r\nTo date, you have received six installments in response to your request.  I am grateful to have your inquiries, because I was intending at this point to ask you some clarification questions that have arisen about your request.\r\n\r\nInitially, please let me note in response to your message, that I do not make \"excuses,\" or \"sell[]\" \"prevarications.\" I operate ethically, within a local governmental agency with a primary mission of educating students. The District takes seriously its obligations to be transparent and to provide the highest level possible of service to requestors of public records, consistent with the purpose of the Public Records Act to provide full access to information concerning the conduct of government, while being mindful of the privacy rights of individuals and the efficient administration of government.\r\n\r\nEstimated dates are estimates. They are subject to adjustment.\r\nThe differing factors I have cited with respect to the need to extend the estimated dates of your installments are factual and specific to each extension. It would not be ethical for me to provide you with the names of employees whose absence due to illness or other causes affected an estimated installment date.\r\n\r\nI am one person in a small legal department of four persons. I am the only person in the District whose primary responsibility is to respond to public records requests. I have other duties. Sometimes time-sensitive tasks intervene that require an adjustment of the estimated response dates to public record requests. I attempt to let you know on or before an estimated date if a change is needed. It is not always possible to do so.\r\n\r\nI am an optimist. If a reschedule is needed, I try to re-set the date as soon as possible, as I did during the month of July 2022. If you prefer not to get as many status notifications, I can, in your case, re-set revised estimates farther into the future.\r\n\r\nYours is one of scores of open records requests that are pending in the Bellevue School District. I have an obligation to treat all requestors evenhandedly.\r\nAbsent special circumstances, I cannot prioritize the request of one person above that of other requestors, who are also waiting for records for which they have an earnest and important need that is meaningful to them.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your request is particularly complex and time-consuming to process. Each installment requires that I access a large database of stored videos. Each video must be reviewed carefully, which usually means watching it in its entirety, in order to determine if it contains exempt material. The large volume of the digital records produced requires special handling and transmission procedures, which adds to the time required to make each installment. Additionally, and importantly, many of the videos reviewed (about half of them, to date) are exempt. The most frequent basis for exemption has been confidential student information. That requires the preparation of exemption logs, which adds significantly to the time required for each installment.\r\n\r\nClarification Questions\r\nYou have received six installments of digital recordings, which represented a variety of types of digital recordings. You have had the opportunity, in the logs provided to you, to see descriptions of the types of recordings that are exempt. Due to the remote learning that occurred during the pandemic closures, many hundreds of recordings remain to be reviewed in response to your request, as it is currently written.\r\nOn the other hand, if you are able to specify your request at this time in a way that is consistent with your purpose, which I assume, based on the Public Records Act, is to become informed about the conduct of government in some respect that is meaningful and importnat to you, your request can likely be completed much more efficiently.\r\nIn that context, so that I can best serve you, please answer the following clarification questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Are you able to specify a type of digital recording that would allow the District to serve you more efficiently so that your intended purpose can be met?\r\n  2.  Are you able to specify a topic of digital recording that would allow the District to serve you more efficiently so that your intended purpose can be met?\r\n  3.  Most of the exempt records are classroom lesson recordings in which students are identified. Do you agree that you do not need classroom videos to meet your intended purpose to become informed about the conduct of government in some respect that is meaningful and important to you?\r\n\r\nYour answers to these clarification questions are due within 30 days, that is, on or before September 8. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District's response, including the next installment.\r\nI will re-set the next estimated installment date to September 12, so that you need not receive another installment of records in which you have no interest.\r\n\r\nFinally, please communicate with this office using the address publicrecords@bsd405.org<mailto:publicrecords@bsd405.org>.\r\nAlso, please do not cut or excerpt the correspondence history of your request.  Reliable and convenient access to a complete correspondence history is essential to the efficient processing of your request. The MuckRock site is not convenient for that purpose.\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

You are wrong.\r\n\r\nYou have not and do not perform adequate searches for responsive records if in fact you perform any search at all.\r\n\r\nYour continued multiple attempts to limit each properly submitted public records request (illegally) for your own self-serving needs is inexcusable and you have been told to STOP.\r\n\r\nYou ridiculously continue to debate even the most simple concepts and seemingly congratulate yourself on your application of obtuse Clinton-esqe statements such as \"I would need clarification of what the definition of is is?\"\r\n\r\nHere is how you can BEST SERVE ME (ME BEING THE PUBLIC):\r\n\r\n1. Keep your personal problems to yourself forever and always. No one cares.\r\n\t\"I am one person in a small legal department of four persons.\" Irrelevant.\r\n\t\"I am the only person in the District whose primary responsibility is to respond to public records requests.\" Will this be the District\u2019s defense in Superior Court for repeatedly violating RCW 42.56 by silently withholding repeatedly requested responsive documents for YEARS?\r\n\t\"I have other duties.\" Oh, wait I take it all back. You are right. RCW 42.56 and Washington State Law take a back seat, Helen has \"other duties.\" Wait, umm no.\r\n\t\"Sometimes time-sensitive tasks intervene that require an adjustment of the estimated response dates to public record requests.\" Thanks mom. Like needlessly torturing members of the public with your endless self-serving Dr. Phil debates like this one?\r\n\t\"I am an optimist.\" Good for you. Again, see Dr. Phil.\r\n\t\"Absent special circumstances, I cannot prioritize the request of one person above that of other requestors, who are also waiting for records for which they have an earnest and important need that is meaningful to them.\" No one here ever asked you to prioritize anything, rather we just beg you to do you job and stop with the whining, arguing, and silent withholding. Meanwhile under what \"special circumstances\" would those be? I missed that non existent portion of the Public Records Act that imparts you with such power.\r\n\r\n2. You are a public employee. Do your job.\r\n\r\n3. Follow Washington State Law. Duh.\r\n\r\n4. For the last time stop requesting this PRA to be limited in it's scope. This is not your business. Work as directed. Your clarification questions have been asked and answered REPEATEDLY.\r\n\r\nHERE YOU GO AGAIN - ANSWERS TO YOUR CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS - YOU WILL NOTE THE ANSWER SHOULD SEEM FAMILIAR TO YOU (in quotes):\r\n\r\n\"From: Anon Request\r\nRE: Request for digital copies of all internet video call recordings in the District's care, custody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21. (Bellevue School District)\r\n04/25/2021\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nDigital copies of all video recordings of internet-based video calls, meetings, training sessions, town halls, school board meetings, and google classroom sessions in the District's care, custody, or control recorded between the dates 01-01-20 through 4-22-21.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, if the District is in possession of any digital recordings of Zoom meeting calls, Skype Sessions, Google Duo calls, Slack, Gotomeeting, etc. (any recorded internet-based video communication/presentation/instruction product) for the period of time 01-01-20 through 4-22-21 I am requesting a digital copy to be produced via internet web link.\r\n\r\nThe District search for these digitally recorded videos should include all computers and digital storage devices owned, operated, or controlled by the District.\r\n\r\nThe District search for these digitally recorded videos should also include a search of all computers and digital storage devices owned, operated, or controlled by District employees if the digital video was recorded on equipment provided to the employee by the District, or if the digital video recording contains content relating to District agency related matters.\r\n\r\nI request the digital video files to be delivered unedited whenever possible and in the original format in which the files were digitally recorded and stored.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by internet web link or e-mail attachment if available or by CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnon Request\"\r\n\r\nFinally, a quick response on your unnecessary self-serving  \"how hard you have it\" summary:\r\n\r\n\"Please note that your request is particularly complex and time-consuming to process. Each installment requires that I access a large database of stored videos. Each video must be reviewed carefully, which usually means watching it in its entirety, in order to determine if it contains exempt material. The large volume of the digital records produced requires special handling and transmission procedures, which adds to the time required to make each installment. Additionally, and importantly, many of the videos reviewed (about half of them, to date) are exempt. The most frequent basis for exemption has been confidential student information. That requires the preparation of exemption logs, which adds significantly to the time required for each installment.\"\r\n\r\nWe have received 5 installments not 6 installments. You also never provided a \"cure\" for the 3rd party referral videos that could not be copied as requested over a year ago. COPIES. Not links to 3rd party websites. Read the public records act. COPIES. \r\n\r\nMost of your redactions and exemptions are improper and you continue to silently withhold responsive public records, both the videos you do not redact and the videos you silently withhold in full. If this continues, we do anticipate seeking judicial review. Most likely good news for you, as that appears what you are pushing for considering your District\u2019s history with the Public Records Act, the many times suit has been filed against your District over this very practice, and your continued offensively dismissive response to the District's non-exhaustive obligations under the law concerning this public records request. A request which is now 15 Months and 3 weeks old with 28 videos produced out of what can only be conservatively speculated as tens of thousands of possible responsive videos.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

There was only one SRO for the timeframe you are inquiring about.  I would normally not know how many guidance counselors there are but I asked the SRO and he replied that there are two of them.  I would not have a record of how many if any, calls came through our 911 System. You would need to inquire with the Communications Department for that information.  The School\u2019s SRO is not paid by them, he is paid through the Police Department.  Just for a point of information, the Police Department has Officer Blue and he goes to School every day with the main SRO and he is our comfort dog.  Attached please find a spreadsheet of information for the \u201creferral\u201d aspect of the request.  The SRO produced this for me whereas he is directly in contact as being the \u201creferral\u201d person. Today is the 10th business day from the request date.  We made the original goal without needing the extension of time.  I believe this concludes our end of the \u201cPublic Records Request\u201d that you submitted.  Stay safe!\r\n\nDebora A.

If my fee waiver is denied, I would like to limit my request\r\nto the two free hours of searching and 100 duplicated pages.\r\n\r\n# Proof Of Affiliation for Fee Waiver\r\n\r\nWaiver Explanation\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. I have\r\n    previously written\r\n    about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000\r\n    readers in outlets such\r\n    as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and\r\n    The Outline,\r\n    among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and\r\n    my editorial and\r\n    writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on\r\n    the files online and\r\n    make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive\r\n    and the journalist\r\n    non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience. While my\r\n    research is not limited\r\n    to this, a great deal of it, including this, focuses on the activities and\r\n    attitudes of the government\r\n    itself. As such, it is not necessary for me to demonstrate the relevance of\r\n    this particular subject in\r\n    advance.\r\n    Further, case law states that \u201cproof of the ability to disseminate the\r\n    released information to a\r\n    broad cross- section of the public is not required.\u201d Judicial Watch, Inc. v.\r\n    Dep\u2019t of Justice, 365\r\n    F.3d 1108, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see Carney v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 19 F.\r\n    3d 807, 814-15 (2d\r\n    Cir. 1994). Further, courts have held that \"qualified because it also had\r\n    \u201cfirm\u201d plans to \u201cpublish a\r\n    number of . . . \u2018document sets\u2019\u201d concerning United States foreign and\r\n    national security policy.\"\r\n    Under this criteria, as well, I qualify as a member of the news media.\r\n    Additionally, courts have held that the news media status \"focuses on the\r\n    nature of the requester,\r\n    not its request. The provision requires that the request be \u201cmade by\u201d a\r\n    representative of the news\r\n    media. Id. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). A newspaper reporter, for example, is a\r\n    representative of the\r\n    news media regardless of how much interest there is in the story for which\r\n    he or she is requesting\r\n    information.\" As such, the details of the request itself are moot for the\r\n    purposes of determining\r\n    the appropriate fee category.\r\n    As my primary purpose is to inform about government activities by reporting\r\n    on it and making\r\n    the raw data available, I request that fees be waived.\r\n    This request specifically includes both previously processed and previously\r\n    unprocessed\r\n    documents. If the documents are 25 or more years old and previously\r\n    processed documents were\r\n    processed before the 25th anniversary of the document\u2019s creation, I request\r\n    that in addition to the\r\n    previous processed copy, the document be reprocessed and redactions\r\n    reviewed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Files\r\n\r\n# Deceased Individual\r\n\r\nPrefix First Name Middle Name Last Name Suffix ARN SSN FBI Number Date of\r\nBirth Place of Birth Date of Death Additional Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    To Whom It May Concern:\r\n    \r\n    Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following\r\n    records:\r\n    \r\n    Records mentioning or describing Sumner Redstone, whose death has been\r\n    widely reported.

These records should include a unique non-identifiable code for the student, the date their IEP was finalized, the date the school assignment request was made, the date the school assignment letter was issued, and the date the student enrolled. \r\nRESPONSE: Data reflecting some, but not all, of the information sought in this part of your request is available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. The FOIA office has been advised by the CPS Office of Diverse Learners Supports and Services that it does not maintain any single system or database that comprehensively tracks each datapoint listed in this portion of your request. The raw data being provided reflects the date of assignment requests made and the date of assignments being finalized. In order to respond to this portion of your request fully, the District would be required to first analyze individual IEP and assignment records and then cross-reference them with enrollment records in order to create a brand-new dataset. That new dataset would then have to be anonymized. Please note that the Illinois Freedom of Information Act applies only to existing records that a public body has chosen to create and maintain in the normal course of its business. It does not require the District to prepare or create records that did not exist at the time the request was made. [5 ILCS 140/1] Accordingly, the District has no further records responsive to your request. To the extent you consider this a denial of your request, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706 . You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.  Thank you for your request.

These records should include a unique non-identifiable code for the student, the date their IEP was finalized, the date the school assignment request was made, the date the school assignment letter was issued, and the date the student enrolled. RESPONSE: Data reflecting some, but not all, of the information sought in this part of your request is available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. The FOIA office has been advised by the CPS Office of Diverse Learners Supports and Services that it does not maintain any single system or database that comprehensively tracks each datapoint listed in this portion of your request. The raw data being provided reflects the date of assignment requests made and the date of assignments being finalized. In order to respond to this portion of your request fully, the District would be required to first analyze individual IEP and assignment records and then cross-reference them with enrollment records in order to create a brand-new dataset. That new dataset would then have to be anonymized. Please note that the Illinois Freedom of Information Act applies only to existing records that a public body has chosen to create and maintain in the normal course of its business. It does not require the District to prepare or create records that did not exist at the time the request was made. [5 ILCS 140/1] Accordingly, the District has no further records responsive to your request. To the extent you consider this a denial of your request, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706 . You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.  Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Ana Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",
