Nissen v. Pierce County, 183 Wa.2d 863 (2015).\r\n\r\nWith respect to requests for records that include \"Writings\" per 42.56.010(4) this means handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and every other means of recording any form of communication or representation including, but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof, and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes, sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which information may be obtained or translated.\r\n\r\nThis request specifically includes - and the District is specifically directed to obtain, preserve in native format, and produce - any records pertaining to public business that exist on any computers, hard drives, portable phones, jump drives, BlackBerries, iPhone, Kindle, IPad, or other devices, or in email, data, voice mail, or text mail accounts owned, controlled or paid for, directly or indirectly, by any agency or 3rd party. \r\n\r\nIn the event the District chooses to provide the records in installments over time I request the records to be produced in reverse chronological order - from the most recent to the earliest.\r\n\r\nIf this request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the PRA. I also request  a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v.

If the .pst format is not available, I would request production of email in .pdf (portable document format) another widely accepted format for email production providing similar economy and convenience of a virtually infinite number emails bundled  into a single digital .pdf file. \r\n\r\nI request records production by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link if available or USB DRIVE or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n  1.  I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n  2.  I recognize in this regard that you are requesting more recent records be produced first. Please be advised that it may be possible to honor that request within a body of records of a certain type (such as emails). It may not always be possible to do so consistently across all record types, due to differences in how different types of records are assembled.\r\n\r\nIn that regard, please specify a date range that you regard as \u201crecent.\u201d For example, are you requesting that the last 6 months of records be produced for all of the persons named above before any earlier records are produced for any other person, at least within a certain type of record? Please be advised that while the District will try to honor your preferences, the District will retain flexibility in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour answers to the above clarification questions are due on or before December 9, 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTiming of Response\r\n\r\nYour request will be completed in a series of installments. At this time, subject to potential adjustment based on your clarifications, I estimate a first installment of records for January 19, 2022. That present estimate is  based on the current workload in this office, staff available to respond to your request, the workload of staff who may be affected by your request and whose assistance may be required, and absences due to illness and/or the anticipated holidays. Response date estimates are subject to change.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Regarding clarification question 1:\r\n\u201cPlease define what you intend by \u201cof.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of that would be that you are seeking records \u201cfrom\u201d the above individuals.\u201d\r\nYour answer included this comment:\r\nRegarding the requested public record communications \"of\" and \"from\" the previously referenced individuals . . ..\r\nIt appears that your answer is that you intend \u201cof\u201d to mean \u201cfrom.\u201d The District will proceed in that manner unless you advise otherwise.\r\n\r\n2.                   Please allow me to explain that In general, email records of each of the named individuals will be searched and produced separately by individual. Some of the search results may be combined in order to avoid a high number of duplications.  The District will retain discretion in this regard in order to process your request most efficiently.\r\nAssuming separate production sets for each individual and some combined groups as appropriate, please advise if you would like to prioritize the individuals listed. The District will try to honor any such priorities, within parameters that are consistent with the most efficient processing of your request.\r\n\r\n3.                   You have asked for records to be produced in reverse chronological order, stating that you prefer the District to produce emails first. To clarify, are you asking that all email records back to 1.1.19 for an individual be produced before any records are produced for another individual?\r\n\r\n4.                   You did not respond to the questions numbered 3 and 4 (renumbered below due to formatting loss in your reply message) regarding targeting your request. As noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743.  Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that production of emails in .pst format is not possible. Every record is reviewed for applicable exemptions, and appropriate redactions will be applied prior to the production of records to you. The redaction process occurs only in a .pdf format. Each individual message is converted to a .pdf format.\r\n\r\nYour answers to these questions are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers may affect the timing of the District\u2019s responses to your request. Additional clarification questions may arise in the course of responding to your request.\r\n\r\nI am glad to assist you in accessing records that will be meaningful to you.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

This is the District\u2019s third request for a response to these questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n3.       It is apparent that your request seeks a very substantial body of records. In the District\u2019s efforts to serve you fully and as efficiently as possible, please consider specifying particular records of interest to you, or at the very least prioritize the records you are seeking in some way that will assist you in determining whether in fact you need all of the records described. For example, you could specify a topic, keywords, or a more narrow date range. You could specify a more targeted group of records to be produced first, while retaining the broader request in case it is needed.\r\n\r\nRequestors are required to specify records requested so they are reasonably locatable. While the records you have described are locatable, the volume is extensive. The volume will affect the time required to produce the records.\r\n\r\n4.       I will assume at this time, consistent with the purposes of the Public Records Act, that you are seeking records that are meaningful to you regarding the conduct of the District, and for a legitimate purpose that will not interfere with the efficient administration of the District. Although you are not required under the law to disclose that purpose, I invite you to do so, so that I can assist you in targeting your request to that purpose. If your request is targeted, it will be much easier for you to find records that are meaningful to you within the body of produced records.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reminding you om 11.17.21 to respond to questions 3 and 4, I explained the importance to you of your answering these questions:\r\n\r\nAs noted, targeting does not limit your request. Rather, it allows you to prioritize so that the records which will be most meaningful to you in support of your purpose will be produced to you before others. I understand this may be important to you in view of the volume of records you are requesting. For example, in searches performed to date, the number of potentially responsive emails from one individual was 38,743. Others were in the 28,000 to 36,000 range.\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss your request with you if it would be helpful. I am often able to help requestors target their requests when I have a better understanding of their priorities.\r\nThank you for clarifying your request at the outset. It is essential that we have a mutual understanding. Additional clarifications may arise in the course of processing your request. Your answers to the questions above are due on or before December 17, 2021. The timing of your answers will affect the timing of the District\u2019s response.\r\n\r\nMissing correspondence history\r\nPlease review the message you sent on 11.19.21 at 1:39 PM, and the message you sent on 11.18.21. In each of those messages, portions of the correspondence history between you and this office were missing, including but not limited to the 11.9.21 message to you containing the clarification questions above, to which you have not yet responded.\r\nPerhaps this is a technical aberration of the service you are using. If necessary, please work with Muckrock to determine why portions of correspondence history related to your request may not be retained when you reply to a message. For example, your 11.19.21 message immediately below contains a history that skips from your message dated 11.02.21 to your message dated 11.11.21. Please take steps to prevent that from occurring in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request Process\r\n\r\nYou state:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo search need be conducted \u2013 archive or copy the entire email account for the dates requested and produce the result preferably in .PST format.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease allow me to help you understand public record response procedures, so that your expectations can be realistic. When a request for records is made, the District conducts a search for potentially responsive records. When potentially responsive records are assembled, each record is reviewed to determine whether it is responsive, and if so, whether the law requires that exemptions be applied to it. If some or all of a record is exempt, the District applies redactions to that record or withholds it, and then describes to the requestor the basis for any exemptions that were applied. As noted below, it is not possible to produce records in .PST format, because records must first be converted to .PDF format in order to apply redactions to them.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it is not possible to \u201ccopy\u201d the contents of \u201can entire email account\u201d and produce all emails within such a an account to you. Each email must first be reviewed, analyzed, and processed for production.\r\n\r\nAs noted in my 11.09.021 message to you, your request will be completed in a series of installments. Due to the procedures described above, only a limited number of email records can be produced per installment. Each request is unique, but given the workload of this office, email records can be generally processed at a rate of perhaps 30-100 individual emails per installment. Installments may occur at varying intervals, which can be 30 days or more. These processing volume rates vary widely based on the nature of the request and other factors.\r\nAs stated above, during the nearly 3-year period you have identified, one of the persons on your list sent 38,743 emails\u2014that is 38,743 emails were \u201cfrom\u201d that person. There may be some duplications within that number. However, even if that number was significantly reduced to something in the range of 20,000 emails, and assuming a rate of processing those records at 100 per month, it could take 200 months, or more than 16 years, to process only the emails \u201cfrom\u201d that one person on your list.\r\n\r\nI am taking the time to explain this to you in detail, at the beginning of processing your request, so that you can understand how important it is to you, assuming your intention is to receive records that are meaningful to you and relate to a legitimate purpose, to limit your request by targeting it in some way as described in questions 3 and 4 above. I can help you find the needle in the haystack that you really want. You do not need to ask for the haystack to achieve your legitimate purpose.\r\n\r\nI am available to assist you in exploring options by which you can limit your request so that it will yield records that will be meaningful to you, while retaining your broader request in case it is needed.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nMy observation in processing your request to date is that it could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\nNo redactions were made to these records.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for February 25, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

You requested emails to be produced in reverse chron order, in 6 month blocks, to/from/cc the following persons in this following order:\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Ivan Duran\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Art Jarvis\r\nAssistant Superintendent Human Resources, Jeff Thomas\r\nChief Communications and Engagement Officer, Janine Thorn\r\nDirector Equity and Strategic Engagement, Shomari Jones\r\nExecutive Director for District and Community Affairs, John Harrison\r\nDirector of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Naomi Calvo\r\nDeputy Superintendent Student Academic Performance and Instructional Leadership, Eva Collins\r\nDeputy Superintendent Finance and Operations, Melissa deVita\r\nDistrict 1 School Board Member Sima Sarrafan\r\nDistrict 2 School Board Member Carolyn Watson\r\nDistrict 3 School Board Member Erica Melief\r\nDistrict 4 School Board Member Christine Chew\r\nDistrict 5 School Board Member Francine Wiest\r\nDirector of Program Office, Melanie McGee\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Sharon Kautz\r\nExecutive Director Teaching and Learning, Heather Edlund\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Patty Siegwarth\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Kelly Aramaki\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Heather S\u00e1nchez\r\nExecutive Director of Schools, Gloria Henderson\r\nThis installment includes emails to/from/cc Superintendent Ivan Duran for the period 10 15 21 through 10 21 2021. It includes 227 messages. The period 10 22 2021 through 11 02 2021 will be the subject of the next installment.\r\n\r\nThe records are being produced to you via Box, from which you may retrieve, view, and download records, within 30 days of receipt. A link will be provided to you to access the records in a message that will follow shortly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Dr. Duran has not been employed by the District since the spring of 2021. As a result, there are no messages from him in this group. The vast majority of messages are commercial solicitations, newsletters or subscriptions; messages on which Dr. Duran was copied because his name may not have yet been deleted from a distribution group; or messages from persons who did not know of his status.\r\n\r\nYour request could be completed more efficiently if you limited the volume of potentially responsive records to retrieve messages that are more likely to be of interest to you. This could be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, you could consider redefining \u201ccommunications of\u201d to mean \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d but not \u201ccc\u201d; limiting the number of persons whose communications are sought; limiting the date range; limiting the request to one or more topics of interest; identifying key words; and/or agreeing that commercial solicitations, newsletters, and subscriptions would not be responsive.\r\n\r\nRedactions were made to one record in this set, consistent with exemptions set forth in the Public Records Act. Redactions are indicated by blocked out text with an overlying code. I have also attached to this message a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis for the exemptions that applied.  If there are any records that contain marked out texts that do not have an overlying code, that is the form in which the record was received by the District.\r\n\r\nI estimate the next installment for March 30, 2022.\r\nIn order to expedite the District\u2019s response to your request, please consider limiting the request to a reasonable volume that is more likely to be of interest to you, as suggested above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

Please do not interrupt our correspondence history by cutting messages out of the email string. I know that history can get long. However, it is important in order for us to communicate effectively that an accurate history of our communications is readily available to both of us.\r\nPlease allow me to summarize our recent correspondence:\r\n\r\nFeb 25\u2013email from BSD, making second installment consisting of 227 emails, and providing link to Box for records.\r\nFeb 26\u2014confirmation from Box site to BSD that you accepted and opened link to records.\r\nJune 29\u2014email from you, stating you had received only one installment, on 1.9.22.\r\nJune 29\u2013email from BSD, setting a next installment for July 21.\r\nJuly 15\u2014email from you, inquiring as to status. Appears to be automated Muckrock email. June 29 message from BSD does not appear to have been read.\r\nJuly 21\u2014email from BSD, inquiring further about your statement on June 29 that you had received only one installment, and listing two installments that were produced. Attached your 2.26.22 acceptance of link to second installment provided via Box site. Advised that estimated installment intended for July 21 would be extended to July 22.\r\nJuly 25, 26, 28 \u2013 emails from BSD, extending estimated dates from July 22 to August 1, with explanations.\r\nAug 3\u2013email from you, explaining (for the first time) that you were not able to open the link to records that were sent to you on 2.25.22.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 Produced to You Again\r\nFirst, let\u2019s take care of your receipt of the records in the February 25 installment. You were advised in a February 25 email that a link to the records was on its way to you. I received confirmation on February 26 that you accepted and opened the link that was sent to you. Now, on August 3, you explain for the first time that you were not able to retrieve records in the link that was provided to you. If you had let me know in February that you had difficulty retrieving the records, we could have resolved it at that time. I recognize there may be glitches with technology. I am glad to work with you to resolve them promptly, if you let me know.\r\n\r\nEach installment is made available to you for 30 days. In the future, if you do not acknowledge and accept receipt of records within 30 days after they are made available to you, your request will be closed as abandoned.\r\n\r\nI am re-sending you the records that were provided to you in installment 2 on February 25, 2021. I will attach these to two emails to you, due to their volume.\r\n\r\nInstallment 2 consisted of 227 email records covering a period of October 15-21, 2021, in zip folders are follows:\r\n2021 10 15_10 19, Duran, 122 (attached here)\r\n2021 10 20_10 21, Duran, 105 (will be attached to an email that follows)\r\n\r\nThe second zip folder includes a record that contains information that is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act. Exempt information is redacted and marked with an overlay code. I will attach to the following email a Redaction and Exemption Codes chart that explains the basis of exemptions applied.\r\n\r\nProgress on your high-volume request\r\nPlease appreciate the overall high volume of your request, when there are 227 email records in one week for one of your named recipients. Each individual email record you request must be retrieved from archives, reviewed for applicability to your request and for exemptions, and then prepared for production to you.\r\nDue to typical operational capacity of this department, it is generally possible to process roughly 100 email records per installment, and to make installments to a requestor every 60 to 90 days. These are general capacity numbers, which may be adjusted in different contexts for different types of requests. Most requestors seek specific information that is likely to be meaningful to them, which allows for effective and efficient request processing.\r\nYour request, on the other hand, seeks a high volume of communications, from a large group of persons, with no specific focus or topic. As a result, the volume of records will be is very high, the retrieval time is extensive, and the review process is very time-consuming.\r\nYou have been provided 446 records in installment 1, Jan 19 2022; and 227 records in installment 2, February 25 2022, for a total of 673 records. This is well within standard processing rate.\r\n\r\nNext Estimated Installment\r\nThe District attempts to meet its estimated installment dates. Sometimes that is not possible. If it is not possible to meet an estimated date, you will be provided an explanation and a revised estimated date.\r\nThe time it took to complete today\u2019s correspondence was time the District was not able to devote to a next installment to you.\r\nI estimate a next installment for September 1, 2022. That estimate takes into account factors of summer staff absences; staff absences for other reasons, including medical leaves; the current workload of this department; and the complexity of assembly and review required for your request as set forth above.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHelen A.

        "communication": "Good afternoon Mr. Manning,\r\n\r\nWe are processing your request for \"[a]ny FOIA requests to the SEC responded during the month of August 2022, and the responsive documents.\" This request was assigned tracking number 22-02910-FOIA.\r\n\r\nWe need to request clarification of your request in order to identify the information of most interest to you. Are you interested in the response letters for just those requests where records were provided?\r\n\r\nWe respond to a high volume of FOIA requests where there is no information found and no records are provided to the requester. We receive between 10,000-13,000 requests per year, so our volume of outgoing final response letters for a single month may be 1,000 letters or more, including only interim and final response letters (not including acknowledgement letters, other types of administrative letters, emails, etc.). Further, these letters are only stored in each individual request file and would require an extensive manual search.\r\n\r\nDepending on the information you are seeking, it might be possible to arrange for an alternative to the letters, such as a list of all requests that were closed during the time period of your request where records were provided.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know at your earliest convenience how you would like you proceed. We will place your request on hold until we hear back, and we would request that you please respond by Wednesday, November 2. We will be happy to work with you to determine the best way to provide the information you are seeking.\r\n\nThank you,\r\nCarrie Hyde-Michaels\r\nFOIA Branch Chief\r\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\r\nOffice of FOIA Services\r\nhyde-michaelsc@sec.gov<mailto:hyde-michaelsc@sec.gov>\r\nDirect: (202) 551-5816",

Responsive materials include all complaints and allegations against any officer, employee, or representative of this policing agency, regardless of whether that complaint or allegation resulted in any investigation or disciplinary action. \r\n\r\nResponsive materials also include all records of use of force by officers, including records disclosing the names, badge numbers, and personnel identification of each officer involved and/or serving as a witness, as well as all available details of the incident: date, time, location, nature of the incident, description of the incident, nature of the use of force, subsequent investigatory materials related to the use of force, the disposition of any investigation into the incident, and any subsequent materials related to the use of force. \r\n\r\nPlease provide materials on a rolling basis, beginning with materials created during the following timeframes: \r\n\u2022 January 1, 2010 - June 15, 2020\r\n\u2022 January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2010\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1990 - January 1, 2000\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1980 - January 1, 1990\r\n\u2022 January 1, 1970 - January 1, 1980\r\n\r\nPursuant to NYCRR Section 1401.5(c)(1), should any of this request be unclear or lack sufficient description for your office, please provide direction that would enable this requester to request records reasonably described. Please also note that the New York FOIL states: \"An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that the request is voluminous or that locating or reviewing the requested records or providing the requested copies is burdensome because the agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may engage an outside professional service to provide copying, programming or other services required to provide the copy....\" Please also see FOIL AO 19671, an Advisory Opinion from the Committee on Open Government [https://docs.dos.ny.gov/coog/ftext/f19671.htm]. \r\n\r\nIf your office has questions about this request or would like to discuss it for any reason, please contact this requester via the contact email address provided and feel free to follow up by phone: 617-299-1832. This request is being submitted to each policing agency in New York as part of a collaborative project led by MuckRock and involving multiple other educational and journalistic partners and participants. For this reason, over the lifetime of this request, your agency may interface with individuals not listed on this initial communication. \r\n\r\nThis request is being made in the public interest by a news organization as part of non-profit (not commercial) journalistic work and research on behalf of the public. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request and as part of the necessary negotiations for successful processing. As far as it is possible, please fulfill elements of this request electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nI look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBeryl Lipton",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

Not to make excuses but the only thing I can figure is that your request got mixed in with others the District is currently working to answer for copies of public records requests the District received\u00a0in 2019 and 2020.\u00a0 Again I apologize\u00a0for the delay and confusion. The District understands that you do not wish the District to use the GovQA platform when answering your request. The District will be sending responsive records to the e-mail address provided but it will also be utilizing the GovQA platform so that it can track all of its records\u00a0request related correspondence. Attached please find the first installment of responsive records to your request. You can expect the next installment in the next twelve\u00a0working days. As you may know, while the public records laws in Washington State are very broad and presume disclosure, they do not require a public agency to create a record to answer a request.\u00a0 Therefore, if the District has records that answer your request, it will provide them to you as requested. Beginning\u00a0December 1, 2022 the District will be charging for all public records requests.\u00a0 Please see our policy and\u00a0procedures\u00a0for our fee schedule https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820578\u00a0 and \u00a0https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820577 If you have any questions or if i have misunderstood your request in any way, please let me know by responding to this email.

You requested the following records:\r\n\r\nI request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021.\r\n\r\nRichland School District has identified and located records responsive to your request.  An installment to your public records request is now available. The District understands that you do not wish the District to use the GovQA platform when answering your request. The District will be sending responsive records to the e-mail address provided but it will also be utilizing the GovQA platform so that it can track all of its records request related correspondence. Attached please find an installment of responsive records to your request. You can expect the next installment in the next three working days. As you may know, while the public records laws in Washington State are very broad and presume disclosure, they do not require a public agency to create a record to answer a request.  Therefore, if the District has records that answer your request, it will provide them to you as requested. Please log in to the Public Records Request Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nThe District acknowledges your request to \"provide all identified public records in their NATIVE format.\" Some information in identified public records require redaction. The District's redaction software requires all attachments to be in PDF format. Therefore, any document requiring redaction will be in PDF format, which may or may not be native format. All redactions will be listed on a redaction log. Also, some attachments not requiring redaction have been converted to PDF to reduce file size as you have requested the District to \"provide all records electronically via direct email attachment...\".\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to receive documents in native format, it will increase the Districts response time and could incur additional fees.\r\n\r\nPlease log in to the Public Records Request Center at the following link to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nPublic Records Request - R000186-010623<https://rsdwa.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/RequestEdit.aspx?rid=344&coid=7BFE0C48206CDD>\r\n\r\nBeginning December 1, 2022 the District will be charging for all public records requests.  Please see our policy and procedures for our fee schedule https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820578  and  https://app.eduportal.com/documents/view/820577\r\n\r\nIf I have misunderstood your request in any way or you have any questions, please reply to this email.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKelsey Greenough\r\nLegal\r\n\r\n\r\nKelsey Greenough\r\nRecords Specialist",

Organizations wishing to participate in the mobility program must first submit request for certification packets to the agency with which they seek to partner. Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTodd Feathers",

This includes, but is not limited to, documents, reports, multimedia, body-worn camera footage, arrest filings, and so on. It also includes all documents, notes, correspondence and memoranda evidencing sustained findings reports and investigations, and all communication and correspondence in whatever tangible medium between the officials, the victims and the overseeing agency. \r\n\r\nI am requesting digital copies of all responsive documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nHere, misconduct includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\nExcessive (unreasonable) force \u2013 beatings, manhandling of people in handcuffs, improper use of Tasers, injuries inflicted by police dogs, improper use of deadly force, and other police brutality or disregard for the safety of suspects. It also includes, but is not limited to: physical and verbal abuse, restraints happening unreasonably, coerced or forced confessions, and sexual abuse and assault. \r\n\r\nFalse arrests \u2013 pulling over, detention, questioning and searches conducted without any probable cause whatsoever, including cases of planted evidence, racial profiling and trumped-up charges of resisting arrest.\r\n\r\nMisconduct investigations do not fall under records that are exempted by the law: \u201cpersonnel and medical files or information and any other materials or data relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; provided, however, that this subclause shall not apply to records related to a law enforcement misconduct investigation\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Public Records Act requires a response to this request within 10 days.  If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than this amount of time, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 415-769-8210 or ananyatiwarijournalism@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnanya Tiwari",

According to our conversation, it is my understanding that the only email records pertaining to Scott Gottlieb that were maintained by the FDA were emails to or from broad distribution lists. As I am concerned more with direct correspondence with Mr. Gottlieb's professional email address, you may exclude those broad distribution emails from this request. If there is a way for Information Management and Technology to retrieve deleted emails during that time frame, I would appreciate it for Mr. Gottlieb's email account.\r\n\r\nI am also aware that official correspondence that went through the Office of the Commissioner was archived starting in 2005. Please amend my request to include these records that were sent from or to or referenced Scott Gottlieb.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAlexander Rony\r\nSierra Club",

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Marquis and Ms. Taylor,\r\n\r\nThank you for your May 9 acknowledgment letter of my FOIA request (number 2017-00731-FOIA-OS). In it, you stated, \"If your request seeks a waiver or reduction of the fees that we would customarily charge for furnishing agency records and your request does not contain sufficient information to enable us to determine whether a waiver or reduction of fees is warranted, you should provide such information to this office within 10 working days of receipt of this letter.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that you waive all fees in connection with this request as provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). The Sierra Club is a national environmental nonprofit with no commercial interest in obtaining the requested information. Instead, our organization intends to analyze and disseminate the requested information free of charge so that the public can be better informed and meaningfully participate in the proper oversight of food and drugs.\r\n\r\nThe subject matter of the requested records is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government by disclosing the views of the new head of the Food and Drug Administration on certain topics that are expected to come before the government.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Club and its supporters have demonstrated interest and expertise in the subject area, specifically the development of policies designed to safeguard public health, reduce the amount of toxic chemicals in food, and encourage a sustainable agricultural economy. Our supporters have filed hundreds of thousands of public comments to agencies related to these issues.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Club also has the ability and intention to disseminate the information it receives through this request. The information may be shared through emails to an audience of hundreds of thousands of people, Facebook and Twitter posts reaching thousands of individuals, articles on our website, and analysis provided to the media. \r\n\r\nIn addition to being granted a public interest fee waiver, I ask that I be properly categorized as a media use requester. My professional duties at the Sierra Club include composing mass communications to our followers, analyzing FOIA responses, and coordinating with press secretaries. Here are three such examples that resulted from my work:\r\n\r\nhttps://sierraclub.org/planet/2017/04/hiring-freeze-prevented-epa-filling-hundreds-jobs \r\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/04/13/politics/epa-hiring-freeze/index.html \r\nhttp://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/press-releases/4480/over-700000-people-tell-government-to-block-seed-mergers \r\n\r\nI hope this is enough information for you to grant me a public interest fee waiver and media requester status, but please let me know if you need more details.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlexander Rony\r\nSierra Club",

        "communication": "--- Please respond above this line --- \r\n01/30/2023 \r\nKayla Henson (Open Records No. H000184-012323), \r\n\r\nWe have received your public information request for H000184-012323, dated 01/23/2023. The information you requested has some components redacted because disclosure would provide competitors an advantage per Tex. Govt. Code \u00a7552.104(a) and the documents consist of \u201ccommercial information\u201d and \u201cfinancial information\u201d which, if disclosed, would cause substantial competitive harm per \u00a7552.110(b). The relevant exceptions from the Attorney General\u2019s Public Information Handbook and the Texas Public information Act are stated below: Tex. Govt. Code \u00a7552.104: Information Relating to Competition or Bidding:\u00a0 Section 552.104 of the Government Code provides as follows: (a) Information is excepted from the requirements of Section 552.021 if it is information that, if released, would give advantage to a competitor or bidder (b) The requirement of Section 552.022 that a category of information listed under Section 552.022(a) is public information and not excepted from required disclosure under this chapter unless expressly confidential under law does not apply to information that is excepted from required disclosure under this section. Section 552.104(a) of the Government Code excepts from disclosure information that, if released, would give advantage to a competitor or bidder. The Texas Supreme Court considered section 552.104 and held the \u201ctest under section 552.104 is whether knowing another bidder\u2019s [or competitor\u2019s information] would be an advantage, not whether it would be a decisive advantage.\u201d408 The supreme court further held section 552.104 protection is not limited to governmental bodies, and therefore a private third party may also invoke this exception.409 The supreme court\u2019s decision overrules a long line of attorney general decisions limiting the application of section 552.104 to governmental bodies and discussing the burden a governmental body must meet in order to withhold information under section 552.104. Both governmental bodies and third parties should therefore exercise caution in relying on prior attorney general decisions regarding the applicability of section 552.104. Section 552.104(b) provides that information excepted from disclosure under this section may be withheld even if it falls within one of the categories of information listed in Section 552.022(a). Tex. Govt. Code \u00a7 552.110(b): Exception; Confidentiality of Trade Secrets; Confidentiality of Certain Commercial and Financial Information Section 552.110 states: (b)Commercial or financial information for which it is demonstrated based on specific factual evidence that disclosure would cause substantial competitive harm to the person from whom the information was obtained is excepted from the requirements of Section 552.021. Section 552.110 now expressly includes the standard for excepting from disclosure commercial and financial information.577 An interested person must demonstrate \u201cbased on specific factual evidence that disclosure would cause substantial competitive harm to the person from whom the information was obtained.\u201d This standard resembles part of the test for applying the correlative exemption in the federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4), as set out in Nat\u2019l Parks & Conservation Ass\u2019n v. Morton. 578 That part of the National Parks test states that commercial or financial information is confidential if disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.579 The current commercial and financial information branch of section 552.110 does not incorporate the part of the National Parks test for information that is likely to impair the government\u2019s ability to obtain necessary information in the future. Like the federal standard, section 552.110(b) requires the business enterprise whose information is at issue to make a specific factual or evidentiary showing, not conclusory or generalized allegations, that substantial competitive injury would likely result from disclosure.580 The hyperlink for the portal is: https://www.tarleton.edu/compliance/open-records/  From the link above, click on \u201cthe Open Records Portal\u201d and then select \u201cMy Request Center\u201d to access this open records request using the assigned reference number above .

With racial equity as a central component of safety and security planning, it is imperative that all school safety and security staff not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.\"\r\n\r\nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST RCW 42.56\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1.\tProvide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.\tProvide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3.\tProvide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nRECORDS INSTALLMENTS\r\n\r\nIf production of responsive records will be completed in multiple installments, please begin by producing records in the numerical order requested by subject matter and year. The most recent public records should be produced first.\r\n\r\nNote: If your agency chooses not to produce the requested records in reverse chronological order as requested, and/or chooses to sandbag this request by dribbling out a few records per installment every 6 months (tee-hee), you can expect a separate targeted public records request for each line item by year - submitted via multiple members of the public, multiple times until the requested records are timely produced. This simple three part multi year request would then become twelve (12) separate public records requests. If your agency would prefer 12 separate individual requests, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERICAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.",

        "communication": "[cid:image002.png@01D8FA93.8D4AB690]\r\n\r\nNovember 17, 2022\r\n\r\nMuckRock News\r\nDEPT MR 120953\r\n263 Huntington Ave\r\nBoston, MA 02115\r\n\r\nPublic Records Requests R000001-020722,  and New Requests\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\n\"On November 4, 2021 the Richland School District received your first records request. Your request was sent from the e-mail address 120953-42737343@requests.muckrock.com.  Your request sought the following records:\r\n\r\n\u2026all Public Records Requests received by Richland School District and a complete electronic copy of the District's Responses to these Public Records Requests for the time period January 1, 2010 through November 4, 2021.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 8th and 9th, the District sent you two requests for clarification.  Then on November 15, the District e-mailed you.  The body of the District\u2019s e-mail is as follows:\r\n\r\nThis District has assigned your request with the number 1142021MR for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when corresponding about this request.\r\n\r\nSince receiving your request, I have sent at least two requests for clarification to your group and have not heard back.  I corresponded using the portal specific to the Richland School District and assigned by your group. I have not heard back from you.\r\n\r\nI am seeking clarification of your very large records request so that the District can provide you with an adequate response.  Is there a staff member that I can speak to for this clarification?  Understanding that you are on the other side of the country, is there a good day and time for me to call?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso on November 15th, you provided an initial clarification.  That same day the District acknowledged your clarification.  The District\u2019s response is as follows:\r\n\r\nI understand your request to be for a complete electronic copy of all public records requests received by the Richland School District #400 including the District\u2019s responses for the years 2021-2021.\r\n\r\nWhat I need clarification on is are you requesting all correspondence not just the initial request and the District\u2019s response as there are time like this, that the District asks for clarification.  Further, there are requests that are abandoned.  By that I mean, the Requestor does not clarify or does not come to retrieve the responsive records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, are you including requests for video in your request?  If so, the District will need to give third parties adequate notice of your request and the opportunity to seek an injunction.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to speak over the phone with the member from your team who is making this request so that we can use our time more efficiently in responding to your request.  Please feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou responded on November 16th by stating that your request was for copies of any public records requests received by the District and any responses to these requests by the District, including abandoned requests and requests for video. You also acknowledged the District\u2019s need to give third-party notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 22, the District informed you that it was in the process of compiling a list of individuals who the District would need to provide third-party notice to and their contact information.  The District notified you that it was beginning the process of reviewing the responsive records to determine if there were any other necessary redactions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on the complexity of your request, the need to provide third party notice, and the need to carefully review the records for redactions, the District informed you it estimated it would take fourteen months to fully respond to your request. The District informed you that it would be providing the responsive records to you in installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District also noted that it was in the process of updating its public records policy.  Part of that policy update related to fees associated with processing and answering records request. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStarting on November 23rd, the District began received a large number of phone calls and e-mails from the individuals who had received the third-party notices.  Most individuals were concerned with who had requested the information and how the records would be used.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn a letter to you on December 1st the District asked that you complete a commercial purposes declaration.  This declaration clearly states that you are not seeking lists of employees and their disclosable information for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn December 6th, the District received notice from you that you were neither seeking records for commercial purposes nor were you requesting any production of responsive documents that required a commercial purposes declaration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District continued to receive considerable communications from third parties it had provided notice to regarding your request. Also, the District was reviewing the responsive records to make sure they included all necessary redactions and contained a redaction log.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District e-mailed you installments to your records request by e-mail on the following dates:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, 2022\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, 2022\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, the District notified you that it was migrating to the GovQA platform to received, process and release all public records requests.  One of the many reasons for this migration is that the District can release responsive files that are significantly larger than what the District\u2019s e-mail system can accommodate.  This allows for records to be release quicker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, you notified the District that while the District was free to use the GovQA platform, you as a Requestor were under no obligation to use the platform. Further you started, \u201c\u2026 as such I respectfully refuse.\u201d  Further you wrote e-mailed the District:\r\n\r\nThe District is directed to provide the requested public records via email or direct no-password, no registration, internet file sharing link. If this is not possible, then responsive records my be provided via US MAIL.\r\n\r\nUS MAIL ADDRESS:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District e-mailed you the following response:\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has begun using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.  GovQA does not have the limitations that the District\u2019s e-mail server has.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that you are requesting the District to accommodate your request not to use GovQA, the District proposes that it start sending your group thumb drives that contain the responsive records.  The downside to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.  Whereas if the District continued to answer your request using GovQA the District would not charge you a fee.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know how you would like to proceed.  The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou acknowledged the District\u2019s e-mail. You again said you would accept response records via US mail and again provided your mailing address in Sumerville, MA.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th, the District provided you with the following correspondence:\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nRichland School District received a public information request from you on November 04, 2021 and it is being processed in accordance with Chapter 42.56 RCW, the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nThe District assigned your request with the reference number R000001-020722 for tracking purposes.  Please use this number when communicating about your request.\r\n\r\nYou requested the following records:\r\n\r\n\u201call public records requests received by the District from November 14, 2011 through November 14, 2021. This includes the initial request, all responsive records from the District, and any redaction logs. Further your request also includes abandoned requests and requests for video records. Excluding list of names seeming for commercial purposes\u201d\r\n\r\nAs you know the District has been working to provide your agency with all responsive records.  Since starting to answer your request the District has began using the GovQA portal/platform to assist the District in tracking and answering public records requests.  One of the reasons the District made this change is that prior to using GovQA, the District was limited in the size of the file it could send requestors.

The down side to this is that the thumb drives and postage will cost money.  Your group would be responsible for these fees.

The District has been inundated with public records request for the past several weeks, but we are committed to providing you with regular installments.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please reply to this email. Thank you for your attention.\r\n\r\nApril 1st, 2022 \u2013 the District mailed you a thumb drive that contained 240 files of responsive records.  It also contained a bill for $36.95. This was sent to your mailing address.  The address the District used was:\r\n\r\nMuckRock\r\nPRR: N000395-110421\r\n411A Highland Ave\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn May 4th the District communicated to you the following:\r\n\r\nRE: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of November 04, 2021, Reference # R000001-020722.\r\n\r\nDear MuckRock,\r\n\r\nWe have not received your payment on invoice number INV22-R000001-1 for Public Records requested by you on November 04, 2021 with Request Number R000001-020722.  \r\n\r\nPlease see attached or login to the Public Records Request Center to view details.\r\n\r\nYou can make a check or money order payable to: Richland School District and mail to:\r\n\r\nAttn: Nayomi Munguia\r\n6972 Keene Road\r\nWest Richland WA 99353\r\n\r\nSincerely,  \r\n\r\nGalt Pettett\r\nCertified Public Records Officer\r\nLegal\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2022, the District sent to you a thumb drive to replace the two that you reported that you had not received.  There was no charge or fee for this as the last two that we have sent to you, have not been received by your organization.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe District is currently loading another installment of responsive record to a thumb drive and will mail it to you by the end of the week. The District will make sure this thumb drive is sent to your new address.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOver the past few days, the District has received several new requests from you.

The District has assigned this request the number R000176-111622. Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.    \r\n\r\nThen on November 15, 2022, the District received another records request from you.  In this request you sought:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2019 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2019.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSRIPTS in the year 2019 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nThe District has assigned this request the number R000175-111622.  Please refer to this number when communicating about this request and please use it for tracking purposes.    \r\n\r\nToday, the District received the following request from you:\r\n\r\nI request the following identifiable public records to be produced in the following order of production, newest to oldest by year:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2.

The District is not required to work on an additional request until the initial requests are completed and closed. Requesters are responsible for informing the Public Records Officer if they want to reprioritize the fulfillment of their requests.\u201d\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTherefore the District will answer your requests in the order it received them. If you want to prioritize your requests, please do so and let the District know which request you want the District to work on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnless you reprioritize the records requests, the District will continue to provide you with all responsive records to request #R000001-020722.

I take great pride in providing excellent services to Requestors. I am in no way trying to frustrate you or not comply with the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, the Richland School District received a records request from an e-mail address containing \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  In that request, the Requestor sought several years of records requests and the District\u2019s response to those records request.  The District has been answering this original request by sending installments to the Boston address below.\r\n\r\nThen in November, your request and others were received by the District from an e-mail address with \u201cmuckrock\u201d in it.  Since these requests were all from \u201cmuckrock\u201d, the District presumed they were all from the same organization.\r\n\r\nAre there different employees of Muckrock making different requests?  Again, I truly want to provide you with the records you want and do not want to frustrate you, but maybe I don\u2019t understand the Muckrock organization.\r\n\r\nAny insight you can provide would be appreciated.\r\n\nThank you,\r\n\r\nGalt L.

        "communication": "Good Morning:\r\n\r\nThe Richland School District received your records request on November 16th.  The District acknowledged the request on November 17th.  At the time, the District believed your request to be from an organization named Muckrock.  As previously explained, the District had received several requests from Muckrock.  As such, the District was answering the requests in the order that they were received.  The District now understands that you are an individual making a public records request through the Muckrock platform.\r\n\r\nThe District apologizes for the mistake and is prioritizing your request.  You requested the following public records:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a complete copy of your agency School Safety and Security Data collection report as submitted by your agency to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n2. Provide complete copies of any and all contracts and/or agreements your agency has with any law enforcement organization or agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\n3. Provide complete contact information and email addresses for any and all Safety and security Staff, School Resource officers, Campus Security Officers, contract security personnel, and any other commissioned or noncommissioned employees or contractors whose primary job duty is to provide safety or security services for your agency for the School Years 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 in that chronological order.\r\n\r\nI have asked the Student Services Department to provide me with the records that answer the first section of your request. I should have those records in the next ten working days.\r\n\r\nAs you may know, the Richland School District serves students in the cities of Richland and West Richland.  The District only has School Resource Officers (SRO) in the high schools located in the city of Richland.  I have attached the agreement between the District and Richland Police Department.  This contract has not been finalized. This is the current version of the Agreement.\r\n\r\nI am also attaching the agreement that has been in place since 2018.  The District will continue to search for any other records that answer this section of your request.\r\n\r\nI understand the third section of your request to be for the work contact information for all safety and security staff, school resource officers and any other employee whose primary job is to provide safety and security services at the District\u2019s school during the 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school years.\r\n\r\nTo answer this section of your request, I have already made contact with the District\u2019s Human Resources Department to obtain the list of all school security staff for the past three school years and their work locations.  I estimate I will have this information to you in the next ten working days.\r\n\r\nTo answer this section, the District has the same two SROs from the Richland Police Department for the past several years.  Officer Jason Crouch has been assigned to Richland High School for the past several years.  His work telephone number is 509-967-6561.  The school\u2019s address is 930 Long Avenue, Richland Washington 99352.  His work e-mail address is Jason Crouch RHSSecure@rsd.edu<mailto:RHSSecure@rsd.edu>.\r\n\r\nRick Kane is the SRO assigned to Hanford High School. Hanford High School\u2019s address is 450 Hanford Street, Richland Washington, 99354. His work telephone number is 509-967-6521. Officer Kane\u2019s work e-mail address is Rick Kane HHSSecure@rsd.edu<mailto:HHSSecure@rsd.edu>.\r\n\r\nThe District did have an SRO at Enterprise Middle School a number of years ago.  West Richland Office Nick Letourneau has not been assigned to the West Richland school for at least two years.  The District is researching the officer\u2019s date of departure.\r\n\r\nAgain, the District apologizes for the mistake and the delay in getting the responsive records to you. We are prioritizing your request and will be providing you with installments of responsive records.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I misunderstood your request in any way or if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGalt L.
