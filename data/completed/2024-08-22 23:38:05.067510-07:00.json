Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

        "communication": "Dear FOIA officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of records for a definitive contract (award ID: HQ003422C0094) awarded to Sancorp Consulting, LLC (UEI: GRYKNJ8BGFC8). This contract has an action date of August 22, 2022, and is funded by the Department of Defense through the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense For Intelligence and Security for support services in the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). This request includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Correspondence (internal emails, physical mail, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n\r\n- Award Letters\r\n\r\n- Task Letters\r\n\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n\r\n- Invoices\r\n\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n\r\n- Presentations by Sancorp Consulting, LLC\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to work being done by AARO and its contractors. During an April 19, 2023 hearing of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, AARO director Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick stated AARO would need additional authorization from Congress to begin counterintelligence work, but given that Sancorp's contract with AARO started in 2022, prior to that hearing, and Sancorp lists on its website previous work in the field of counterintelligence, there is a possibility AARO may already be engaged in counterintelligence work without Congressional authorization. Sancorp's contract with AARO would help clarify this apparent contradiction.\r\n\r\nThere is no risk of interfering with ongoing operations or disclosure of sensitive materials. Sancorp already lists the contract on their publicly-accessible website: https://www.sancorpconsulting.com/_files/ugd/7aeb19_0c37a59d213b4d68a043ef83b56edc9a.pdf\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "Ms. Joo Chung\r\nAssistant to the Secretary of Defense for Privacy\r\nCivil Liberties, and Transparency (PCLT)\r\nOffice of the Secretary of Defense\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn May 21, 2023, I submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552, FOIA case number 23-F-0905, for copies of records for award ID HQ003422C0094. This ID is connected to a contract awarded by Department of Defense through the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense For Intelligence and Security to Sancorp Consulting, LLC (UEI: GRYKNJ8BGFC8) in 2022, for work identified as \u201cAARO SUPPORT SERVICES.\u201d\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\n\r\nOn September 11, 2023, I received a partial response, attached, from Stephanie L. Carr, Chief, Department of Defense (DOD), Freedom of Information Division, stating that the DOD had identified 125 pages of documents responsive to my request, but that it would be releasing only a portion; a file containing 34 pages, labeled 23-F-0905_doc_1.pdf, was attached.\r\n\r\nThe partial response letter also stated: \u201cFinally, Acquisition Directorate conducted an exhaustive search of their records systems for the following: Correspondence (internal emails, physical mail, etc.); Requests for Information; Memorandum(s) of Understanding; Letters of Interest; Task Letters; Privacy Impact Assessments; and, Presentations by Sancorp Consulting, LLC. After thorough searches of their electronic records and files, no records of the subjects were located. In this instance, fees for processing your request were below the threshold for requiring payment. Please note that fees may be assessed on future requests.\u201d\r\n\r\nAPPEAL\r\n\r\nUpon review of the partial response letter, the Acquisition Directorate appears to have overlooked at least one item identified in my original request, which I reproduce in part below:\r\n\r\n\u201c- Correspondence (internal emails, physical mail, etc.)\r\n- Requests for Proposals\r\n- Requests for Information\r\n- Statements of Work\r\n- Memorandum(s) of Understanding\r\n- Letters of Interest\r\n- Award Letters\r\n- Task Letters\r\n- Privacy Impact Assessments\r\n- Invoices\r\n- Purchase and/or Change Orders\r\n- Project Budgets and/or Budget Proposals\r\n- Evaluation Reports\r\n- Presentations by Sancorp Consulting, LLC\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease take note that the Acquisition Directorate\u2019s response jumps from \u201cRequests for Information\u201d to \u201cMemorandums of Understanding.\u201d Missing is an acknowledgement that the Acquisition Directorate did or did not locate records responsive to my request for \u201cStatements of Work\u201d (SOW). Per Acquisition Directorate documents available on the General Services Administration\u2019s website, attached, this item may also be identified as a Performance Work Statement (PWS). Page 4 of a PowerPoint presentation labeled \u201cPWS Writing Tips,\u201d dated April 16, 2014, identifies the SOW and PWS as being synonymous. This information can be found at: https://hallways.cap.gsa.gov/system/files/doclib/april-2015-clemens-pws-presentation-final-1523974380.pdf\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am appealing the partial response because the DOD Acquisition Directorate, in the course of its exhaustive search, could not identify whether it does or does not have an SOW/PWS on record. Given that the Acquisition Directorate has created a separate document identifying best practices for the writing of an SOW/PWS, it should already be familiar with this item and require no additional clarification.\r\n\r\nI am also requesting an additional search for records responsive to my original request. If the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense For Intelligence and Security and the Acquisition Directorate could overlook the SOW/PWS, then it is possible they may have missed other information.\r\n\r\nI am renewing a request for a fee waiver. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, the Geopolitical Economy Report, and Creem Magazine, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). This request would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of government with regard to work being completed on behalf of a government agency, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

        "communication": "RECORDS REQUESTED\r\n\r\nI hereby request the following records under the Freedom of Information Act: all records related to Elizabeth Sutherland Mart\u00ednez. \r\n\r\nOTHER NAMES USED:\r\n\r\nMs. Mart\u00ednez sometimes went by \u201cLiz Sutherland,\u201d using her middle name. Her name later evolved to Elizabeth Sutherland Mart\u00ednez and then to Elizabeth \u201cBetita\u201d Mart\u00ednez. Please note that Ms. Mart\u00ednez's last name contains the Spanish-language letter \"\u00ed\" (an \"i\" with an accent mark). When searching for responsive records, please search for \"Mart\u00ednez\" (with the accent mark) and \"Martinez\" (without an accent mark).\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHIC DETAILS AND PROOF OF DEATH\r\n\r\nMs. Mart\u00ednez was born on 12 December 1925, in Washington, D.C. She died on 29 June 2021. Ms. Mart\u00ednez's news obituary from the Washington Post is attached.\r\n\r\nABOUT MS. MARTINEZ\r\n\r\nElizabeth Mart\u00ednez was a leftist activist who worked primarily on Mexican American and feminist issues. \r\n\r\nMs. Mart\u00ednez graduated with honors in 1946 from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. She then moved to New York to work at the United Nations, where she did research on colonialism and its racial implications.\r\n\r\nFrom 1955 to 1957, she was an assistant to Edward Steichen, the noted photographer who was director of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art. She was a book editor at Simon & Schuster from 1958 to 1964 and then spent a year at the Nation magazine as an arts editor.\r\n\r\nShe made the first of several trips to Cuba in 1959, months after the revolution led by Fidel Castro, and also visited other Communist-led countries, including the Soviet Union, China, Hungary and North Vietnam. Her writings about her travels drew the attention of the FBI, and she was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee. \r\n\r\nIn 1960, Ms. Mart\u00ednez joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). She helped edit an illustrated book on civil rights, \u201cThe Movement\u201d (1964), with text by playwright Lorraine Hansberry. During the Freedom Summer of 1964, Ms. Mart\u00ednez went to Mississippi to help register African American voters. She later became the director of the New York office of SNCC and edited \u201cLetters From Mississippi\u201d (1965), a collection of first-person accounts by young civil rights workers.\r\n\r\nIn 1968, Ms. Mart\u00ednez moved to New Mexico. She helped found and edit a bilingual newspaper, El Grito del Norte (The Cry of the North). She established a Marxist collective in Albuquerque and helped lead protest marches for the rights of workers and women. She joined American Indian demonstrators at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973, when they occupied several buildings on the Pine Ridge reservation and were confronted by federal law enforcement officers.\r\n\r\nIn 1976, she published \u201c450 Years of Chicano History in Pictures,\u201d a bilingual book that was widely used in schools.\r\n\r\nAfter settling in the San Francisco Bay Area, Ms. Mart\u00ednez became a key figure in the Democratic Workers Party and edited its newspaper. She ran for California governor in 1982 as the candidate of the Peace and Freedom Party and won 66,000 votes.\r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that all fees related to this request be waived.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors:\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks a person's FBI file.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks information that, to my knowledge, is not already in the public domain. Of course, without already knowing what records the Bureau has, I can't say for sure whether those records are already in the public domain or what the public would learn from them; however, because Ms. Mart\u00ednez has recently died, the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Ms. Mart\u00ednez was a public figure. As noted in her obituary in the Washington Post, her writings about her travels in Communist-led countries drew the attention of the FBI, and she was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee. The obituary also notes that she often attracted a coterie of younger activists as she lectured around the country and conducted workshops on understanding racism. Thus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek. I will also make any records available online for free via muckrock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that lets people share the results of their FOIA requests and encourages journalism around them.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Ms. Mart\u00ednez has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released until now. Again, I cannot be 100% sure if factor is satisfied without already knowing what records the Bureau has. However, given that Ms. Mart\u00ednez's Washington Post obituary states that the FBI was interested in investigating her foreign travel, it seems reasonably likely that responsive records will significantly enhance the public's understanding of the FBI's interest in Ms. Mart\u00ednez and her activism.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government's surveillance of its critics. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion: on balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies at FBI Headquarters. Please also conduct a search for records at the Alexandria Records Center. If any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing the transfer or destruction, including (with out limitation) confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of the records.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nI would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. I look forward to receiving your response within 20 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

As I explained in my request, the subject of my request was a public figure and prominent political activist, in whose activities the FBI is known to have taken an interest. Responsive records are likely to be of significant interest a broad spectrum of people. Moreover, the public has a significant interest in knowing about how their government surveils and investigates those who loudly criticize it.  For these and the other reasons outlined in my original request, the Bureau should have granted my fee waiver. \r\n\r\nThank you for considering this appeal.\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJames Earl Ray (March 10, 1928 \u2013 April 23, 1998) was an American convicted of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Ray was convicted on his 41st birthday after entering a guilty plea to forgo a jury trial. Had he been found guilty by jury trial, he would have been eligible for the death penalty. He was sentenced to 99 years in prison. He later recanted his confession and tried unsuccessfully to gain access to a retrial. In 1998, Ray died in prison of complications due to chronic hepatitis C infection. His death has been widely reported. http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/24/us/james-earl-ray-70-killer-of-dr-king-dies-in-nashville.html?pagewanted=all\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

If more than 4 hours of employee time is required to search for, compile, segregate, redact or reproduce the records requested, a fee may be charged at an hourly rate equal to or less than the hourly rate attributed to the lowest paid employee who has the necessary skill required to complete the record request, which rate shall not exceed twenty-five dollars ($25) per hour.\r\n\r\nWe will begin the process of calculating this fee. Please note that payment of the fee will be required prior to the completion of the request. If the actual costs are less than the estimated fee, a refund will be issued. If the actual costs are greater than the estimated fee, a revised fee estimate will be issued.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPatrick Stone\r\n\r\n\r\nPatrick Stone\r\nDirector of Strategic Communications and Marketing\r\nCape Cod Community College\r\n774-330-4714\r\npstone@capecod.edu<mailto:pstone@capecod.edu>\r\n\r\n[Image]\r\n\r\n[Image]<https://www.facebook.com/CapeCodCommunityCollege/>[Image]<https://www.instagram.com/capecodcc/> [Image] <https://twitter.com/capecodcomcol>  [Image] <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fTjw_c8yLGB_Zb6WZEqEg>\n",

Please also include negative expense amounts, which is rare but does occur.\r\n\r\nIn case it\u2019s helpful, I've attached an image example of what I\u2019m hoping to receive. The columns may be in any order, and the fiscal years may be on one sheet or different sheets. The columns can be sorted in any order, or unsorted if that\u2019s easiest.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m anticipating that this request may be fulfilled by a simple financial report generation and export of the generated file, and therefore shouldn\u2019t take much human time or incur any fees. Please let me know immediately if this isn\u2019t the case, so I can modify my request as necessary to meet the PRL deadline of 10 business days.\r\n\r\nPlease email the Excel file by the deadline of Monday August 26th, 2024.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAJ Vincelli\r\nGraduate Student Union at UMass Dartmouth",

Pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(b), \u201cPrivate information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or a court order,\u201d and pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c), \u201cPersonal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. \u201cUnwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject\u2019s right to privacy outweighs the legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy. Personally identifiable student record information has been redacted in accordance with the Illinois School Student Records Act 105 ILCS 10/1 et seq. and the corresponding Section 7.5(r) FOIA exemption\u00a0(5 ILCS 140/7.5(r)). Further, portions of records are exempt from release pursuant to Section 7.5(h) of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure \u201cinformation the disclosure of which is exempted under the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act, and records of any lawfully created State or local inspector general\u2019s office that would be exempt if created or obtained by an Executive Inspector General\u2019s office.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7.5(h). Redactions have been made pursuant to section 7(1)(f) which exempts from release \u201c[p]reliminary drafts, notes, recommendations, memoranda and other records in which opinions are expressed, or policies or actions are formulated, except that a specific record or relevant portion of a record shall not be exempt when the record is publicly cited and identified by the head of the public body. The exemption provided in this paragraph (f) extends to all those records of officers and agencies of the General Assembly that pertain to the preparation of legislative authority.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(f). Furthermore, this exemption is \u201cintended to protect the communications process and encourage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a decision is made.\" State Journal-Register v. Univ. of Ill. Springfield, 994 N.E.2d 705, 713 (2013). Further, redactions have been applied in accordance with section 7(1)(m) of the FOIA which exempts from release \u201c[c]ommunications between a public body and an attorney [] representing the public body that would not be subject to discovery in litigation, and materials prepared or compiled by or for a public body in anticipation of a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding upon the request of an attorney advising the public body.\u201d 5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(m).

This aligns with the public's right to know and fosters a more informed citizenry. This request is not being made for any commercial purpose or profit. \r\n\r\nWe have obtained the requested information from nearly 1,000 other agencies at no cost. This demonstrates that such requests are routinely fulfilled without imposing financial burdens on requesters. \r\n\r\nIn consideration of these factors, I'd like to request that the Wichita Police Department waive the fees associated with this request.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if I am able to access an existing agency roster containing some part of the requested information, it could potentially save time and resources for both parties.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration of this appeal.",

Each City department receives, searches, and responds to public records requests on behalf of its own department, not Citywide.

As explained in our July 3rd email to you, we redacted from these records messages containing personal and private information that did not constitute a \"public record.\"  Although the legal basis for these redactions was proper, we now realize that the technical method we used to black out the private material did not in fact protect the private information from disclosure.  That was not our intent and was an inadvertent error.  The material we intended to redact contains sensitive personal information that is protected from disclosure by Cal. Constitution Art. I, Sec. I and Section 6254(c) of the Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nIn such cases of accidental, inadvertent disclosure of private or confidential information in response to a Public Records Act request, the documents must be returned and copies destroyed if the City notifies those who have received an inadvertently disclosed record.  (See Ardon v. City of Los Angeles (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1176). The SFPUC hereby requests that MuckRock immediately destroy all copies of Bates numbers PUC 000175 through PUC 000219 in its possession and remove them from all publicly accessible locations, including the MuckRock.com website.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the version of this text exchange that we shared with you on July 6, 2020 has been removed from the Sharefile weblink. You can access a new redacted version of this text exchange at the following link: https://sfpuc.sharefile.com/d-sabd81b687ef4187b.\r\n\r\nPlease respond on or before Thursday July 9 at 5 pm confirming that you have destroyed and/or removed these records.

This is a reminder that the following requests sent July 7 have had no response whatsoever, including a lack of extension , in violation of the CPRA. You need to inform me which requests have records, which are being denied with justification, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore, below are new Immediate Disclosure Requests (SF Admin Code 67.25(a)) directed to SFPUC and Harlan Kelly Jr. Your response is required by July 8, 2020. Rolling records responses are requested (SFAC 67.25(d)) if you are unable to immediately produce records. Exact copies of every responsive record are requested (Gov Code 6253(b)) - do not: provide mere URLs, print and scan electronic records, convert native files to PDFs, or provide black and white versions of any color images. Provide only copies of records not requiring fees and in-person inspection of all other records (GC 6253).\r\n\r\n1. All calendar entries of any kind, with all details, invitee lists, attachments, and metadata, for Harlan Kelly Jr. for any meetings or travel with Walter Wong (including but not limited to jaidin@pacbell.net, jdngrp@pacbell.net, or any email address ending with jaidin.net ) (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017)); see also SOTF 19047 Anonymous v. Breed\r\n\r\n2. All payments made by Harlan Kelly Jr. to Walter Wong/Jaidin Consulting Group/Jaidin Associates/affiliated companies (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017))\r\n\r\n3. All payments made by Walter Wong/Jaidin Consulting Group/Jaidin Associates/affiliated companies to Harlan Kelly Jr. (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017))\r\n\r\n4. All contracts between Walter Wong/Jaidin Consulting Group/Jaidin Associates/affiliated companies and Harlan Kelly Jr. (you must search personal accounts pursuant to City of San Jose v Superior Court (2017))\r\n\r\nPlease provide rolling responses, starting with the most recent records going backwards.\r\n\r\nDo not destroy or discard any responsive records - we will appeal all withholdings or Sunshine violations. Remember Mr. Kelly has an obligation to maintain in a professional and businesslike manner their correspondence and release them as public records (SF Admin Code 67.27-9(a)); and we will cross-check your responses with all other parties to ensure you have not destroyed or withheld records improperly.\r\n\r\nYour non-exhaustive obligations:\r\n- All withholding of any information must be justified in writing (SFAC 67.27).\r\n- All withholdings by masking or deletion (aka redactions) must be keyed by footnote or other clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld (SFAC 67.26).\r\n- You must respond to emailed requests (SFAC 67.21(b)).\r\n- You must notify us of whether or not responsive records exist and/or were withheld for each below request (Gov Code 6253(c), 6255(b)).\r\n- You must state the name and title of each person responsible for withholding any information (Gov Code 6253(d)).\r\n- Do not impose any end-user restrictions upon me (Santa Clara Co. vs Superior Ct, 170 Cal.App 4th 1301); so if you use a third-party website like NextRequest to publish records, please make them completely public without any login or sign-in.\r\n\r\nYour agency must do all of the above things in your response, and you cannot wait until we file complaints.\r\n\r\n****** We have no duty to, and we will not again, remind the City of its obligations. Instead, we will file complaints for every Sunshine Ordinance or CPRA violation. We will continue to file complaints until the City's procedures are modified to fully comply with the Sunshine Ordinance and CPRA, without caveat or exception. ******\r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please be certain you have properly redacted all of your responses.

The SOTF have started to conduct remote meetings via videoconference and are working to establish procedures to resume all operations including the processing of complaints.\r\nWhile the Sunshine Ordinance requires that certain actions be taken within 45 days, the Covid-19 emergency has forced delays and immense new backlogs for complaint hearings.  We write today to ask if you are willing to waive the 45 day rule for your complaint.\r\nThe SOTF intends to resume hearing complaints on a limited basis and complaints will be queued to be heard in the near future.  We continue to work to address technical issues posed by remote meetings.  We are aware of the time sensitivity of your records requests.

I know that your agency still possesses at least some of these records both based on the black hiliter file and also based on your admission in the recent letter to me ( https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2021/02/22/2-22-21_Letter_re_Harlan_Kelly_texts.pdf ).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnonymous",

        "communication": "Supervisor of Records Dennis Herrera:\r\n\r\nThis is a petition under SF Admin Code 67.21(d) to determine in writing that the redacted portions of the attached exhibits and of the attachment on page 7 of the Melanie records are public and order them disclosed.  It continues to challenge various previously-unappealed parts of the PUC's response to the June 11, 2020 request from this email address.  You may wish to consider it as part of the prior-filed March 2 and March 9 petitions re: overly-redacted Kelly-Breed messages, and March 9 petition re: overly-redacted Naomi Kelly-Harlan Kelly messages, as long as you make determinations on all challenged records.  The Melanie record has been redacted voluntarily by us to remove a phone number which was published by PUC itself.\r\n\r\nAs we have already proven via prior petitions, the PUC previously unlawfully redacted certain text messages between Harlan Kelly Jr. and Walter Wong.  Moreover, the PUC has admitted as such in its Feb 22, 2021 letter (in which it also re-released a new version of mostly-unredacted Kelly-Wong texts) and via DCA Jon Givner's letter of March 8, 2021.  The PUC apparently violated the law because it allowed Harlan Kelly Jr. to control the redaction of his own records without any oversight by the PUC itself -- which also was apparently then and remains now the policy and practice of the City, pursuant to your long-standing advice to the City re: your interpretation of City of San Jose v. Superior Court.  However, as you discuss in your memo interpreting, the City is always ultimately responsible for the actions and judgments of its employees in such matter.\r\n\r\nGiven Kelly's prior mis-redaction of the Walter Wong texts to protect  sensitive-but-disclosable communications, there is no reason to believe that the redactions made in the attached text messages were then or are currently lawful, and each must be justified under a specific provision of the law.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a copy of the attachment on page 7 of the Melanie records must be produced as required by Admin Code 67.21.  This tiny, compressed, printed and scanned version is unreadable and thus withholds its textual content, which is precisely why we have successfully previously argued that such production does not even constitute a \"copy\" of the underlying record (see SOTF decisions 19098 Anonymous v Police Department, 19131 Anonymous v Cisneros).\r\n\r\nOn March 10, 2021, you asserted a right to simply refuse to issue determinations to petitions filed pursuant to Admin Code 67.21(d).  It is telling that you have decided to do so as we have continued to successfully uncover violations of the law by City agencies and officials, including both by yourself personally and your office (see SOTF decisions 19108 Anonymous v Herrera, 19044 Anonymous v Office of the City Attorney, 19120 Anonymous v Office of the City Attorney).\r\n\r\nIf you refuse to review the records and issue a determination and order if needed, you will be violating Admin Code 67.21(d) yourself and potentially aiding your City clients in violating the law as a direct result of willfully refusing to perform your own legally-mandated duties.\r\n\r\nThe City has throughout its history, whether by declaring war on the Sunshine Ordinance Task Force or on successful transparency advocates themselves, attempted to neuter the Sunshine Ordinance to prevent disclosure of all lawfully-disclosable public information which may be unfriendly to senior officials' political prospects.  Yet the public has the right to know whether its representatives conduct the public business in the interest of the public or in their private interest.\r\n\r\nAs such advocates become more successful, your office appears to consider them a threat to your control over the City's public records regime, instead of treating us fairly as petitioners in a proceeding where you act in a quasi-judicial role.  There is no doubt I file numerous petitions -- and those petitions and complaints have forced the City to become significantly more compliant with the Sunshine Ordinance, which can be seen by the additional disclosures your office causes agencies to provide in response to my petitions and the nearly entirely successful series of complaints I have won at the SOTF.\r\n\r\nAs long as the City continues to violate the law -- apparently often due to your deputies' poor advice or training -- no ethical option exists other than to continue to petition and appeal for complete, timely, and lawful disclosure, without exception.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAn Anonymous Independent Journalist",

This is the page where the PUC in its Feb 2021 production removed the pre-2015 messages.  One page should not take this long and this constitutes an unreasonable delay.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder:\r\n- PUC published a PDF record in July 2020 at https://sfpuc.sharefile.com/d-sfaf513caac747dcb with nearly completely unredacted Kelly-Wong messages.  Its first page contained pre-2015 messages.\r\n- PUC in July 2020 requested a retraction and that I delete my copy of that PDF (which I voluntarily did, and without conceding any obligation to do so), and PUC published a replacement which redacted most of what Kelly and Wong said to each other, including redacting the pre-2015 messages.\r\n- PUC in Feb 2021 provided a third version of the file at https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2021/02/22/Harlan_Kelly_Text_Messages_-_Redacted_Jan_29_2021.pdf which unredacted most of the Kelly-Wong messages but completely removed the pre-2015 portion as non-responsive.\r\n\r\nI want that pre-2015 public record portion.\r\n\r\n2. PUC previously disclosed a Juliet Ellis text message in this series of requests, vis: https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2020/07/27/J_Ellis_personal_text_ACP_Redacted.pdf\r\n\r\nThis is an immediate disclosure request for text, chat, or instant message communications between the \"MC\" mentioned in that message (presumably now agency head Michael Carlin) and Juliet Ellis from June 10, 2020 to present.  This is an immediate disclosure request for text, chat, or instant message communications between \"MC\" and \"Scarpulla\" from June 10, 2020 to present. This is an immediate disclosure request for text, chat, or instant message communications between \"MC\" and any member of the Board of Supervisors or their staff from June 10, 2020 to present.  Provide rolling responses, exact copies, and preserve all date/time stamps, participant names, group convos, attachments, images, audio, and video.\r\n\r\nThank you for your expected cooperation.\r\n\r\n(ignore the message re Amazon prime in the thread - looks like spam sent to the mailing list)\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnonymous",

Therefore, with the exception of the text messages predating 2015 contained on the page Bates stamped PUC 000175, we have disclosed to you as of February 22 all non-exempt information that you now seek. You have separately requested text messages in this chain that predate 2015, and we are currently reviewing those messages with the City Attorney's Office. As mentioned in the email we sent to you on March 18, 2021, we anticipate we will provide you with a response to that request on or before next Friday, March 26.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we interpret your March 9, 2021 request to seek disclosure of the same information already provided to you on July 9, 2020 and February 22, 2021 and resent with this email. With regard to your remaining request for text messages pre-dating January 1, 2015, we estimate that we will fully respond to your request on or before Friday, March 26, 2021.\nBest Regards,\r\nMayara Ruski Augusto Sa\r\nSFPUC Public Records Senior Analyst",

These, I know you have retained somewhere.\r\n\r\n(2) Any text, chat, or instant messages between Harlan Kelly Jr. and any of David Gray, Julie Labonte, Henry Alvarez, (Rudolph) Dwayne Jones, Chris Gruwell, Tommy Moala, Paul Giusti, Juliet Ellis, Harlan Wong, Willie Brown, Chief William Scott, Tom Hui, or Nick Bovis.  These, maybe you have lying around on a computer.   Possibly an iMessage backup or similar.\r\n\r\nYou have provided some of these records in the past, but this is a NEW request, that you need to provide a new response to. Based on your Wong/Kelly response, somewhere on your PUC government systems (and not Kelly's PEDs) is likely a fully unredacted, no-time-limit record of these messages and PUC must now use its own judgment (not Kelly's) to decide what to redact here. \r\n\r\nYou may, at this moment, not have retained images, attachments, etc. but if you do retain them anywhere, you need to turn them over.   But they may very well be stored within the archive of the iMessages that are apparently on your computer systems.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like an exact copy of the native PDF files (after redactions) - not a print/scan copy.  Acrobat can correctly apply redactions where the black rectangle cannot be removed - but you just need to use the tool correctly.   I have won multiple SOTF rulings on this same matter and will file complaints if you do not comply.\r\n\r\n--Anonymous",

        "communication": "Dear Requestor,\r\n\r\nWe are writing in response to your request dated March 24, 2021 in which you asked for the following: \"(1) Any text, chat, or instant messages between Harlan Kelly Jr. and Mayor London Breed. These, I know you have retained somewhere. (2) Any text, chat, or instant messages between Harlan Kelly Jr. and any of David Gray, Julie Labonte, Henry Alvarez, (Rudolph) Dwayne Jones, Chris Gruwell, Tommy Moala, Paul Giusti, Juliet Ellis, Harlan Wong, Willie Brown, Chief William Scott, Tom Hui, or Nick Bovis. These, maybe you have lying around on a computer. Possibly an iMessage backup or similar.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to Item No. 1 of your request, the SFPUC does not have any records in its possession that are responsive to this item other than the redacted text messages we previously provided you in response to your records request dated June 11, 2020. We are attaching those records here again for your reference.  As you are aware, Mr. Kelly searched for and redacted these text messages from his personal cell phone last year when he was SFPUC General Manager.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the SFPUC is only responding to this request on its behalf and with regard to records in our agency's possession.  Accordingly, you may wish to submit a separate public records request directly to the Mayor's Office, as that office may have records responsive to Item no. 1 of your request.\r\n\r\nRegarding Item no. 2 of your request, after conducting a diligent search for responsive records, we have determined that we do not have in our possession records responsive to this item. Please note that the SFPUC has only conducted a search for records in its possession.  Accordingly, you may wish to submit a separate public records request directly to the San Francisco Police Department and/or Department of Building Inspection, as those agencies may have records responsive to this item.\r\n\r\nWe now consider your request dated March 24, 2021 to be closed.\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nMayara Ruski Augusto Sa\r\nSFPUC Public Records Senior Analyst",

Once we receive a response from the SEC staff, our office will continue to process your request as expeditiously as possible.  Due to the unforeseen delays, the new estimated completion date (ECD) is December 31, 2023.  This new ECD is to ensure that the agency\u2019s search of records is accurate, and if records are located, sufficient time to review them for responsiveness.  We do sincerely apologize for the unusually long delays.  You may continue to contact me during the interim.\r\n\nKindest Regards,\r\n\r\n      Alysia Morrow\r\nFOIA Research Specialist\r\nOffice of FOIA Services\r\n\r\nOFFICE                 +1 202 551 8376\r\namorrowa@sec.gov<mailto:amorrowa@sec.gov>\r\n\r\n[Title: SEC logo]",

        "communication": "Kinda, yeah, but not exactly.\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting you run the search again but only with that parameter returning larger files, with the intent of seeing how many files are of the kind that might fit the \"1 GB of data can contain anywhere from 16,000 individual pages to over 60,000 pages\" estimate. Using size:1048568..1074000000 returns all the results that are between about a megabyte and a gigabyte. I'm making an educated guess that a very small number of files are responsible for the majority of the on disk space.\r\n\r\nI suspect that some files are very large on disk (like powerpoints with uncompressed images), but have very few pages that need to be reviewed. As an example, a scientist colleague of mine once had a powerpoint presentation that was more than a gigabyte in size, with something like only 50 slides. She'd included some videos that had never been compressed, which drastically inflated the file size.\r\n\r\nI do not know exactly what features the city pays for (the licensing agreement with Microsoft is the subject of another ongoing FOIL request of mine!), but one possible option is you may be able to export a report to see more information about the documents the search returns:\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ediscovery-export-a-content-search-report\r\n\r\nAn alternative that I provided was to simply download a copy of the larger search results and spot check them to see if there are just a few files that account for the majority of the on-disk space. That's very easy with some common free software, but if you wish to do it manually, increasing the parameter to something like size:52430000..1074000000 should reduce the volume of files even further.\r\n\r\nI'd expect that using size:1048568..1074000000 might return several hundred files, and size:52430000..1074000000 might return a few dozen. If you run the 50 MB-1GB search and the size of the responsive records are like 10GB, that means we've found the culprit! And I can ask you to either review the number of pages in that files when estimating the voluminousness of the request as a whole. If it's just a few powerpoints, neither of us have to worry about days  spent redacting 16,000 pages, it may only be a hundred.",

        "communication": "Hello there, we are approaching three missed agency-proposed records production dates. Will the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date/deadline most recently proposed by the agency be met?\r\n\r\nI would like to assume the agency is being forthright with me about meeting a date they propose, and have no knowledge of anything that they might be able to reasonably foresee preventing them from producing the requested and agreed upon records. I struggle to fathom how a pre-existing and ongoing backlog could surprise anybody by causing delays in records production - some agencies have abused this with me in a downright rude manner to delay requests more than a dozen times. \r\n\r\nI have no personal animus with any individual employed by the department - in a likely understaffed role - who is following routine agency procedures, and I presume they have no issue with me. We're all working with unfair systems run by people we have no contact with! Indeed, the records access officer I dealt with earlier was exceptionally helpful and more technically competent than the majority of records access officers that I've interacted with.\r\n\r\nOver the years I have learned that such agency-proposed records production dates are more often missed than met, and it's no more likely the agency will meet the next date they propose than the one they've missed. On muckrock, this agency is a bit better than the average NYC agency, and returns records with an average of 113 days, so we're just on the edge of meeting this date! That's good news - I just want to rely on something better than crossed fingers.\r\n\r\nI am pre-emptively appealing on grounds of constructive denial of records. I am asking the agency to provide guarantees that the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date/deadline most recently proposed by the agency will be met, and if it cannot be met under current circumstances, that the agency shall either provide a date for which they will provide such records absent circumstances a reasonable person cannot reasonably forsee delaying production of records, or assign sufficient staff to meet the agency proposed records production date. \r\n\r\nI look forward to this appeal being moot upon production of records by the August 16, 2024 agency-proposed records production date.",

Inspector Tony Robles noted that on May 9, 2024, he went to the Baltimore and spoke with the complaining tenant, and took photos.  Please provide all of those notes, documents, photos or videos.\r\n3. All communications regarding the February 2022 inspection by Tony Robles of the Baltimore, during which he noted over 100 violations for lack of deadbolts, but James Heiberg said to delete those violations. \r\n4. All communications between anyone from Code Enforcement and anyone at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, regarding the deadbolts at the Baltimore.  This is including but not limited to the text messages and emails that Robert Gilardi kindly sends to Mark Dyer rather than issuing a Notice to Comply. This includes communications between Code Enforcement on the one hand, and on the other hand,  AHF's: Mark Dyer, Michael Weinstein, Jonathan Eisenberg, Tom Myers, Conrad Sison, Beatrice Di Marco, Dominique Eastman, Herbert Ellis,  Juan Larios.\r\n5. Any discussion (including emails, text messages, memos, notes) between any Code Enforcement employee, (including but not limited to James Heiberg, Robert Gilardi, Tony Robles, Ann Sewill, etc.), that includes any of the following terms: \"1941.3\" \"deadbolt\" \"dead bolt\" \"91.8607\" \"door lock\" \"91.8607\" and/or \"897099.\" \r\n6. Any discussion between any Code Enforcement employee, about why it decided to exclude the exact complaint language from the publicly accessible Property Activity Report on complaint #897099.\r\n7. Any emails with the subject line \"Complaint # 897099 / Baltimore Hotel / Carlos Brum/ Lack of Deadbolts\"\r\n\r\nThis public records act request is not limited to the custodian of records simply forwarding this request to the named individuals here. This request demands that the custodian of records actually contact its IT department and conduct a search with the specific parameters and search terms. This request demands electronic copies of these records in their native format, and not printed out and scanned.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAnnette Morasch",

None of the emails which show they have attachments were produced with the attachments. \r\nThese records also do not include any of the following requested documents:\r\n\r\n2. Inspector Tony Robles noted that on May 9, 2024, he went to the Baltimore and spoke with the complaining tenant, and took photos. Please provide all of those notes, documents, photos or videos.\r\n3. All communications regarding the February 2022 inspection by Tony Robles of the Baltimore, during which he noted over 100 violations for lack of deadbolts, but James Heiberg said to delete those violations.\r\n4. All communications between anyone from Code Enforcement and anyone at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, regarding the deadbolts at the Baltimore. This is including but not limited to the text messages and emails that Robert Gilardi kindly sends to Mark Dyer rather than issuing a Notice to Comply. This includes communications between Code Enforcement on the one hand, and on the other hand, AHF's: Mark Dyer, Michael Weinstein, Jonathan Eisenberg, Tom Myers, Conrad Sison, Beatrice Di Marco, Dominique Eastman, Herbert Ellis, Juan Larios.\r\n5. Any discussion (including emails, text messages, memos, notes) between any Code Enforcement employee, (including but not limited to James Heiberg, Robert Gilardi, Tony Robles, Ann Sewill, etc.), that includes any of the following terms: \"1941.3\" \"deadbolt\" \"dead bolt\" \"91.8607\" \"door lock\" \"91.8607\" and/or \"897099.\"\r\n\r\nDocuments have been redacted without reason. I understand why you woudl redact tenant contact information (which you did for some, but not others). But there are whole chunks of communications redacted without saying who was involved in the redacted communication. Thus the majority of my requests were ignored by the  City. \r\n\r\nConclusion. If I do not receive a fully compliant response to my PRA, we will file a writ of mandate and seek attorneys' fees on August 19, 2024.",

Provide records sufficient to show copies of 10 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not seeking any personally identifiable information or otherwise exempt information. As required by the statute, please ensure that the requested documents are redacted rather than exempting the entirety of the document. Additionally, for any and all exemptions used to redact exempt information, please provide clear and convincing evidence for each exemption used by your agency.\r\n\r\nBecause this request is in the public interest for Illinois nonprofit The FOIA Bakery\u2019s work to advocate for public education, please waive any fees in accordance with 5 ILCS \u00a7 140/6(c).

Your FOIA Center reference number for tracking purposes is: N015952-080424 \r\nYou have requested the following records: To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nPer the CPS Comprehensive Policy on Attendance (Section 703.1, Board Report 22-0622-PO1), Section II, paragraph B (a):\r\n\r\n\"Schools must send a letter notifying a student\u2019s family of 5 unexcused absences, and, subsequently, 10 unexcused absences. 10 day letters of unexcused absence notification are to be sent certified, return receipt requested.\"\r\n\r\nIn FOIA N014933-022924, the District indicates, \"Be advised that while there is a system in place that advises schools of students who have had 5-day and 10-day unexcused absences, the correspondence that is to be sent out to parents is the responsibility of individual schools.\"\r\n\r\n1. Provide a blank template letter for the 5 day unexcused absence letter;\r\n2. Provide a blank template letter for the 10 day unexcused absence letter;\r\n3. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 5 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024;\r\n4. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 10 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not seeking any personally identifiable information or otherwise exempt information. As required by the statute, please ensure that the requested documents are redacted rather than exempting the entirety of the document. Additionally, for any and all exemptions used to redact exempt information, please provide clear and convincing evidence for each exemption used by your agency.\r\n\r\nBecause this request is in the public interest for Illinois nonprofit The FOIA Bakery\u2019s work to advocate for public education, please waive any fees in accordance with 5 ILCS \u00a7 140/6(c). Feel free to contact me with any questions, or if clarification is needed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMiriam Bhimani\r\n\r\nUpload documents directly: https://accounts.muckrock.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.muckrock.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3D%252Faccounts%252Fagency_login%252Fchicago-public-schools-3121%252Ftruancy-letter-notices-170888%252F%253F&url_auth_token=AAATZ6_n4zL9LUQrOAhSu0BQ7O8%3A1sanBo%3AYCro7lg516eF4JArdx_Ih5r8tVrhL5dMIg75F67Q86I \r\n \r\nChicago Public Schools (CPS) responds to all public records requests in accordance with the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 ILCS 140/1 et seq. \r\nDue to the volume and complexity of requests received in the normal course of business, CPS is extending the time for its initial response to your request by an additional 5 business days (to 10 business days total beginning on the first business day following receipt of the request) pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(e)(v) which allows for the examination and evaluation of the requested records by personnel to determine if they are exempt from disclosure under Section 7 of Illinois FOIA or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions. \r\nUpon the completion of a response, CPS will provide the first 50 pages to you at no charge. \u00a0If a response is more than 50 pages, a fee of 15\u00a2 per page will be charged for each additional page. Copies of video recordings have a fee of $48. All applicable fees must be paid prior to the copying. CPS will inform you of any fees due if your paper response exceeds 50 pages.

Provide a blank template letter for the 5 day unexcused absence letter; \r\n2. Provide a blank template letter for the 10 day unexcused absence letter; RESPONSE: Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. \r\n3. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 5 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024; \r\n4. Provide records sufficient to show copies of 10 Days Unexcused Absence letters issued in SY 2023/2024. RESPONSE: The CPS FOIA Office has reviewed your request with the CPS Office of Student Support and Engagement and the CPS School Administration & Health Services Team and has been advised that the information you seek is not comprehensively tracked centrally in the regular course of business. Be advised that while there is a system in place that advises schools of students who have had 5-day and 10-day unexcused absences, the correspondence that is to be sent out to parents is the responsibility of individual schools. As such, this information is not centrally tracked or can be counted. In order to provide you with information responsive to your request, a FOIA Officer would have to go to each school to conduct a search and create a new record which is not required pursuant to the FOIA. Specifically, creating records and answering questions is not required according to guidance provided by 5 ILCS 140/2(c). 5 ILCS 140/1, Kenyon v. Garrels, 184 Ill. App. 3d 28, 32 (4 th Dist. 1989), and Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 678 F. 2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Additionally, under Illinois FOIA law, a request to inspect or copy a record must reasonably identify a public record, as opposed to general data, information or statistics to be gleaned from documents which have not otherwise been created by a public body. Accordingly, FOIA applies to the provision of existing public records; a public body is not required to answer questions or generate new records in response to a FOIA request. Further, section 1 of FOIA states in part: \u201cThis Act is not intended to create an obligation on the part of any public body to maintain or prepare any public record which was not maintained or prepared by such public body at the time when this Act becomes effective, except as otherwise required by applicable local, State or federal law.\u201d In accordance with Section 1 of the Illinois FOIA, the District is not required to conduct research to answer your questions or prepare researched records on your behalf in response to your request. To the extent you consider this a denial, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706.\u00a0 You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11. Thank you for your request. Sincerely, Ana Diaz Freedom of Information Act Officer Chicago Public Schools",
