I request any and all documents pertaining to National Guard involvement with \"Battle Los Angeles.\" Such documents may include but should not be limited to: script notes; production assistance agreements; and all records of communications between employees of the National Guard and the cast, crew, and production company of \"Battle Los Angeles,\" including memos, notes of meetings and conference calls, emails, and other forms of communication.\r\n\r\n\"Battle Los Angeles\" appears on a list of National Guard-supported film and TV productions (attached to this request) as \"Battle LA.\"\r\n\r\nI am the Director of Research Operations at a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization called The Decoding Culture Foundation. These documents will be used for public education and research purposes. I therefore request a waiver of all fees that may otherwise apply. Attached is a document with organization letterhead confirming my position, as well as the organization's 501(c)(3) application and approval form.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrett Carollo",
