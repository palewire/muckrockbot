        "communication": "Dear Esteemed Appeals Officer,\r\n\r\nI pen this missive with the earnest intent of appealing the lamentable withholding of the \"Amendment to DS Employment Contract\" and other germane materials mentioned in the agenda for the annual board meeting of March 29, 2023, at the Capital Region BOCES. As a steadfast pursuer of truth and justice, I have observed an unfortunate pattern of concealing essential information from the citizenry, both prior to, during, and after the board's meetings.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the New York Freedom of Information Law (FOIL), I submitted a request for all draft or final materials presented or discussed during the annual board meeting, which encompassed the amended agreement between the Albany-Schoharie-Schenectady-Saratoga BOCES and District Superintendent Anita M. Murphy. Despite receiving a response containing a presentation related to the budget, notice of meeting acknowledgment, and agenda, the document in question and other vital materials were not provided.\r\n\r\nThis practice of obscuring material information from the public is not only incompatible with the values of openness and accountability, but it also erodes the people's confidence in the board's decision-making process. The Open Meetings Law (OML) obliges public bodies to make available to the public all materials discussed or presented during a meeting. The non-disclosure of the \"Amendment to DS Employment Contract\" and other significant materials is a clear contravention of this imperative.\r\n\r\nIn light of these concerns, I humbly request that you reconsider the initial decision and furnish me with a copy of the \"Amendment to DS Employment Contract\" and all other pertinent materials mentioned in the agenda. Furthermore, I entreat the board to adopt appropriate measures ensuring that all relevant information and documents are made available to the public in a timely and transparent manner, consonant with the requirements of both the FOIL and OML.\r\n\r\nAs an additional observation, it has come to my attention that the following link on BoardDocs, which ought to provide details on the \"Amendment to DS Employment Contract,\" remains devoid of any information: http://go.boarddocs.com/ny/crboces/Board.nsf/goto?open&id=CQ7QCV67C36B. This absence of information serves to further underscore the necessity for prompt action in addressing the aforementioned concerns.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your attention to this matter of considerable import and eagerly anticipate your prompt response in accordance with the statute's requirement.",

Lists of Title IX complaints are publicly available on the Sexual Violence Prevention and Response - Policies and Reports<https://sexualviolence.ucdavis.edu/annual-reports> page. These annual reports go back to 2014-2015, and the 2022-2023 report is being compiled as we speak. It will be posted to the website in April 2024.\r\n\r\n     *   Internal communications within the University of California, Davis regarding Title IX complaints filed during the above academic years.\r\n\r\n                                                               i.      Internal communications regarding Title IX complaints are exempt from disclosure pursuant to Government Code \u00a7 7922.000, where \"...the public interest served by not disclosing the record[s] clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record[s].\" Particularly, \"[t]he disclosure of materials would expose an agency's decision-making process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency's ability to perform its functions, and \"frank discussion[s] of legal or policy matters might be inhibited if subjected to public scrutiny.\" (California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Ct. (1998) 67 Cal. App. 4th 159, 170. See also Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Ct. (1991) 53 Cal. 3d 1325.) Disclosure of such investigative records would impair the privacy of investigation participants, impair the integrity of the investigation and decision-making process, discourage reporting of employee misconduct, and discourage participation of complainants and witnesses.\r\n\r\n                                                             ii.      Additionally, these communications are exempt to protect individual privacy under the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\") (20 U.S.C. 1232g, student privacy), the California Information Practices Act (\"IPA\", Civil Code section 1798 et. seq., employee privacy), the California Constitutional right to privacy, and the common law right to privacy. Both the California Constitution and the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") expressly contemplate that under certain circumstances, the privacy rights of individuals supersede the right of public access to public records. The University is required to apply a \"balancing test\" in such cases to determine whether the individual's privacy interest outweighs the public right of access, given the specific facts at issue.\r\n\r\n     *   Any records relating to Title IX complaints filed from January 1, 2024 to February 14, 2024.\r\n\r\n                                                               i.      See attached\r\n\r\n\r\n     *   In addition to the above request, I would like the raw data for all reports made to the Title IX Compliance office for the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 academic years, omitting identifying information where necessary.\r\n\r\n                                                               i.      If the raw data you are looking for is not contained in these reports, let me know.\r\n\r\nWith the delivery of this email and the records herein we are considering your request closed.

Your request was received in the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) FOIA office on August 26, 2020 and assigned the FHFA FOIA request number 2020-FOIA-050.  Please refer to this number in any correspondence concerning your request.\r\nYou requested the following information:\r\n\"Any correspondence: text messages, emails, memos, etc. Describing how the 50 bps Adverse Market Reaction game to be, why the date September 1st was chosen, and how 50bps was determined to be fair.

FHFA will grant expedited processing pursuant to the FOIA and FHFA regulation, 12 CFR Part 1202.10, if the request demonstrates a compelling need by establishing one or more of the following:\r\n\r\n  1.  Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;\r\n  2.  An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks are NOT the \u201cfederal government\u201d) if you are a person primarily engaged in disseminating information;\r\n  3.  The loss of substantial due process or rights;\r\n  4.  A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the Federal Government\u2019s integrity, affecting public confidence; or\r\n  5.  Humanitarian need.\r\nMerely stating that \u201cI request\u2026expedited processing since this is of the utmost interest to the general public as this adverse market reaction fee could cost consumers billions.\u201d does not provide sufficient information to grant your request for expedited processing. Therefore, your request for expedited processing is denied and your FOIA request will be processed in the order it was received. You may appeal the FHFA\u2019s decision regarding your request for expedited processing pursuant to FHFA regulation, 12 CFR Part 1202.10(c).\r\nPlease note that the FHFA processes requests under a multi-track system (standard and complex).  After review of your request, it has been determined that your request will be placed in the complex track. FOIA requests are placed in this track based on the volume and/or complexity of records requested. Currently, your request is number 15 in the request queue.\r\nYour FOIA request is releasable to the public under subsequent FOIA requests. In responding to these requests, FHFA does not release personal information, such as home or email addresses and home or mobile telephone numbers, all of which are protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 6 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6)).\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the processing of your request, please contact me directly at stacy.easter@fhfa.gov<mailto:stacy.easter@fhfa.gov>.\r\n\u200b\r\nSincerely,\r\nStacy J.

Your request was received in the FOIA office on August 26, 2020 and assigned the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) FOIA request number 2020-FOIA-050.  Please refer to this number in any correspondence concerning your request. Your request was processed in accordance with the FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) and the FHFA's FOIA regulation (12 CFR Part 1202).\r\n\r\nYou requested the following\r\n\r\n\"Any correspondence: text messages, emails, memos, etc. Describing how the 50 bps Adverse Market Reaction [c]ame to be, why the date September 1st was chosen, and how 50bps was determined to be fair. Correspondence regarding how it was determined that this adverse market reaction fee would have no impact on the average consumer. Any research regarding this Adverse market reaction fee. Any correspondence: text messages, emails, memos, etc. Describing the reason for the delay to December 1st.\"\r\n\r\nA search of FHFA files and records did not locate any records responsive to your request. While Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (the Enterprises) and/or the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) may have responsive documents in their files, our search consisted of FHFA files only.\r\n\r\nUnlike FHFA, the Enterprises and the FHLBanks are private entities and are not obligated to comply with a request made under the FOIA. Under the FOIA, only \"agency records\" are subject to disclosure. The FOIA defines \"agency records\" as records that are (1) either created or obtained by an agency, and (2) under agency control at the time of the FOIA request. See U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 942 U.S. 136, 144 (1989). See also Wolfe v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 711 F.2d 1077, 1081-82 (D.C. Cir. 1983).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the purpose of the FOIA is to open the actions of government agencies to public scrutiny, not to reveal the inner workings of private entities. FHFA's regulation and conservator responsibilities does not transform the Enterprises and the FHLBanks records into \"agency records\" subject to the FOIA. Further, FHFA has no duty under the FOIA to search for or request production of documents in the Enterprises and the FHLBanks possession. Nor does the FOIA require the Enterprises' and the FHLBanks to search for responsive information. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Fed. Housing Fin. Agency, 744 F, Supp. 2d 228, 235 (D.D.C. 2010)(quoting Consumer Fed'n of America v. Dep't of Agric., 455 F.3d 283, 288 (D.C. Cir. 2006))(\"[U]se is the decisive factor here.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is FHFA's final decision on your FOIA request. If you wish to appeal any aspect of FHFA's decision, you must forward within 90 days:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  *   A copy of your initial request;\r\n  *   A copy of this letter; and\r\n  *   A statement of the circumstances, reasons, or arguments for seeking disclosure of the affected record(s).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be sent either electronically by 5pm to foia@fhfa.gov or postmarked within 90 days and mail to the \"FOIA Appeals Officer\" at 400 7th Street, SW, 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20219. The subject line, or the envelope and the letter of appeal, must be clearly marked \"FOIA Appeal.\" Please note that all mail sent to FHFA via the United States Postal Service is routed through a national irradiation facility, a process that may delay delivery by approximately two weeks. For any time-sensitive correspondence, please plan accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration. OGIS can be reached at 8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001; by email at ogis@nara.gov; by telephone at 202-741-5770 or toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or by facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nYour FOIA request is releasable to the public under subsequent FOIA requests. In responding to these requests, FHFA does not release personal information, such as home or email addresses, and home or mobile telephone numbers, which are protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 6 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6)).\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the processing of your request, please contact me directly at stacy.easter@fhfa.gov<mailto:stacy.easter@fhfa.gov>.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStacy J.

That would require a lot of man power that we do not have.  Only after an office informs me that they may have responsive documents can I identify individuals to search.

Your request was received in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's (FHFA) FOIA office on January 20, 2023, and assigned FHFA FOIA request number 2023-FOIA-017. Your request was processed in accordance with the FOIA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) and FHFA's FOIA regulation (12 CFR Part 1202).\r\n\r\nYou requested, the names (and descriptions if available) of datasets/databases containing home prices/values. Specifically, any database that identifies median home prices/values by MSA utilizing data from the Enterprises, preferably datasets which have been created for 20+ years.

I also request a detailed contemporaneous log to be provided for any document withheld or redacted.\r\n\r\nFor each responsive record the District contends is exempt from public disclosure, in whole or in part, please specifically identify the record by subject, title, author, custodian and date, and state how a specific statutory exemption applies to each record as required by RCW 42.56.210(3) and Rental Housing Ass'n v. Des Moines, 165 Wn.2d 525, 199 P.3d 393 (2009).\r\n\r\nI request electronic production of all electronic records in the original NATIVE electronic format for each record. \r\n\r\nI request for these public records to be produced by public (no password) e-mail attachment or link. If electronic attachment or link is not possible, an alternative would be to produce responsive records via USB DRIVE or DATA CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nTHIS REQUEST IS NOT BEING MADE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPRA Audit",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

The possible return date of 8/28/23 -- more than three months after the request was filed \u2013 is unreasonable, given the narrow scope of the request.\r\n\r\nBecause of this appeal, BKDA is required by law to provide specific reasons within 10 business days explaining why this request cannot be filled, or else, must provide the records sought.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Committee on Open Government, if a government entity acknowledges that a request has been received, but has failed to grant access by the specific date given beyond twenty business days, or if the specific date given is unreasonable, a request may be considered to have been constructively denied (see \u00a789[4][a]).  In such a circumstance, the denial may be appealed in accordance with \u00a789(4)(a), which states in relevant part that:\r\n\r\n\u201c...any person denied access to a record may within thirty days appeal in writing such denial to the head, chief executive or governing body of the entity, or the person therefore designated by such head, chief executive, or governing body, who shall within ten business days of the receipt of such appeal fully explain in writing to the person requesting the record the reasons for further denial, or provide access to the record sought.\u201d \r\n\r\nI, on behalf of New York Focus, am requesting either you fill this FOIL request, or else provide a full explanation as to the reason for the denial, as required by law, of this public record.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSam Mellins\r\nSenior Reporter, New York Focus",

If orientation materials are provided digitally to new employees, please provide digital copies of these materials.\r\n\r\nYou may limit this request to materials that are currently provided to new employees.\r\n\r\nIf there are ways to modify or change the scope of my request to reduce the burden on agency resources, please let me know. If over the past six months you\u2019ve responded to another requester with information that likely covers substantially similar material and re-releasing that same material instead of a new search reduces the burden on agency resources, please let me know and I\u2019m happy to consider accepting that instead of requiring a new search.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge and the request is made in the process of public policy research news gathering and not for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKiera Murray",

Requests for Records\r\nRecords Request No. 1: All Documents constituting, reflecting, relating to or that contain current use policies if any for each type of 1033-program controlled equipment, including situations or circumstances in which use is authorized or prohibited.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 2: Records that list the dates, locations, suspected offense(s) or rationale for operation, controlled equipment deployed, arrests, and uses of force for each deployment of 1033-program controlled equipment since July 1st, 2019, specifically: firearms, armored vehicles, and night vision equipment.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 3: All records of complaints regarding the use and impact of 1033-program controlled equipment, including correspondence, visual or audio-visual materials, and responses to complaints.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 4: Documents that constitute, reflect, relate to or that contain rationales or criteria for acquisition of 1033-program controlled equipment, prior to its acquisition.\r\n\r\nII. Response Time\r\nPlease provide requested documents as they become available.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten (10) days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6255. Pursuant to section 6253, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n\r\nThe American Friends Service Committee seeks this information as the requestor to promote and provide public access to these documents and increase civic engagement. Because this request is made on behalf of a nonprofit public interest organization, with the intent to make this material easily accessible to the public, we request that you waive any fees. In responding to this request, please keep in mind that Article 1, \u00a7 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution expressly requires you to broadly construe all provisions that further the public\u2019s right of access, and to apply any limitations on access as narrowly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the Healing Justice Program at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Lindsay-Poland",

Office of the Governor v. Engelkemier, 148 A.3d 522, 530 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016). A request must identify the subject matter, the scope, and the timeframe of the records sought.  You provided a time frame of the records you are seeking.  However, your request has no defined group of individuals whose records are to be searched nor does it identify any subject matter, but states that you are seeking \"[c]opies of all 'change requests' or reasonably similar correspondence\" which does not indicate some business of the agency and would likely lead to a broad universe of responsive records. Therefore, your request is insufficiently specific.\r\n\r\nIn order for the department to process your request, please identify a subject matter of the communications regarding \"change requests\" you are seeking.  The subject matter of the request must identify the 'transaction or activity' of the agency for which the record is sought.  Please also identify the specific people at the department (or a group, such as senior staff) that may have sent or received the communications you are seeking.\r\n\r\nYour prompt response will be appreciated so that the department can continue working on your request.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAndrea Bankes | Agency Open Records Officer\r\nOffice of Administration\r\nDepartment of Human Services\r\nRoom 234 Health & Welfare Building | Hbg PA 17120\r\nPhone: 717.787.3422 | Fax: 717.772.2490\r\nwww.dhs.pa.gov<http://www.dhs.pa.gov/>\r\n\r\nCreating partnerships to deliver quality services to customers through collaboration, consultation and supports.\n",

This record is a responsive record integral to my Request. Release of the Agency\u2019s copy is not optional.\r\n\r\nREQUESTED FORMAT. \r\n\r\nI am also seeking records in their native format (MS. Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, ADA accessible PDF files by return email with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records via email in PDF format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done. \r\n\r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel). Under the terms of the E-FOIA Amendments of 1996, Section 5, if a document exists in electronic format, it must be released in that format upon request.\r\n\r\nEach record must be provided as a distinct record in their native format.

Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n\r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number and cite records sought.\r\n\r\nProvide Records via Muckrock.com.\r\n\r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. Notwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest. \r\n\r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES. \r\n\r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee. The OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub.

My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOAI meeting. I have an active email distribution list of Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA professionals, FOIA advocacy groups media and interested parties. I also communicate regularly with members of Congress.\r\n\u2022\tSee examples below.\r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the Chief FOIA Officers Council https://www.archives.gov/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council  \r\n\r\n-\tPublic Comments Submitted to the FOIA Advisory Committee | National Archives https://www.archives.gov/ogis/foia-advisory-committee/public-comments \r\n\r\n-\tOGIS Annual Open Meeting Public comments  https://www.archives.gov/ogis/outreach-events/annual-open-meeting  \r\n\r\n-\tDocument Cloud.

This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n \r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office. There are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n\r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1.\tEnsure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2.\tAbsent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3.\tUse requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default. \r\n4.\tMemorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5.\tProvide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6.\tAdvise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7.\tPrior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8.\tIn the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n\r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. \r\n\r\nPlease search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later. \r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved. \r\n\r\nIn any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues. \r\n\r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n\r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action  I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter.  No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted or fragmented data.  Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).  \r\n\r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals and of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n\r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n\r\nAPPLICABLE RETENTION SCHEDULE, NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n\r\n020 \tAccess and disclosure request files.

I am also seeking a copy of this FOIA Request, which is an Agency record subject to FOIA that exists and is in the Agency\u2019s possession at the time of my FOIA request. This record is a responsive record integral to my Request. Release of the Agency\u2019s copy is not optional.\r\n \r\nREQUESTED FORMAT.\r\n \r\nI am also seeking records in their native format (MS. Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, ADA accessible PDF files by return email with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records via email in PDF format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done.\r\n \r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel).

Emails should be provided as MS Outlook files, if not encrypted or otherwise unable to be opened by me. Only if this is not possible, emails should be produced with their embedded hyperlinked attachments by using the \u201cFile => Save as Adobe PDF\u201d command within Outlook or by other software that produces the same result.\r\n \r\nThis request is distinctly separate from any other. Please do not combine this request with any other request in your reply. I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n \r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number and cite records sought.\r\n \r\nProvide Records via Muckrock.com.\r\n \r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. Notwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n \r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n \r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee. The OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat. 2477 .)\r\n \r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING.\r\nI certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that a compelling need exists for expedited processing as discussed below:\r\n1. Records are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\na. Potential bias in NARA\u2019s handling of unauthorized removal of official records by our current and prior president and other senior officials in those administrations is of great public interest, which relates to my underlying FOIA request.\r\nb. I may place this correspondence into the public domain to document NARA alleged misconduct.\r\n \r\n2. Additionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOAI meeting. I have an active email distribution list of Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA professionals, FOIA advocacy groups media and interested parties. I also communicate regularly with members of Congress.\r\n\u2022 See examples below.\r\n \r\n- Public Comments Submitted to the Chief FOIA Officers Council https://www.archives.gov/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council\r\n \r\n- Public Comments Submitted to the FOIA Advisory Committee | National Archives https://www.archives.gov/ogis/foia-advisory-committee/public-comments\r\n \r\n- OGIS Annual Open Meeting Public comments https://www.archives.gov/ogis/outreach-events/annual-open-meeting\r\n \r\n- Document Cloud.

I am seeking expedited processing due to eminent substantial loss of due process rights related to mu underlying FOIA request and appeal, which is now ripe for litigation.\r\n \r\nESTIMATED COMPLETION DATES\r\n \r\nProvide me with the initial estimated completion date (ESD) for this matter along with contemporaneous adjusted ESDs as they change. See Office of Government Information Services Advisory Opinion No. 2020-01: Agencies Must Provide Estimated Dates of Completion Upon Request https://www.archives.gov/ogis/advisory-opinions/2020-01-agencies-must-provide-edcs\r\n \r\nSTILL-INTERESTED PREEMPTIVE REPLY. This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n \r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office. There are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n \r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1. Ensure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2. Absent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3. Use requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default.\r\n4. Memorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5. Provide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6. Advise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7. Prior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8. In the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n \r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\r\n \r\nPlease search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later.\r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved.\r\n \r\nIn any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues.\r\n \r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n \r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n \r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter. No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted or fragmented data. Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).\r\n \r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals and of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n \r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n \r\nAPPLICABLE RETENTION SCHEDULE, NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n \r\n020 Access and disclosure request files.

The definition of \u201crecords\u201d includes:\r\n\u201c[A]ill books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of data in them.\u201d 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 (emphasis supplied).\r\n2. FOIA requires that \u201ceach agency, upon any request for records which (i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A).\r\n3. FOIA requires that \u201ceach agency shall establish a system to assign an individualized tracking number for each request received that will take longer than ten days to process and provide to each person making a request the tracking number assigned to the request\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)(7)(A).\r\n4. FOIA requires that each agency shall \u201cestablish a telephone line or Internet service that provides information about the status of a request to the person making the request using the assigned tracking number, including the date on which the agency originally received the request; and an estimated date on which the agency will complete action on the request. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)(7)(B).\r\n5. FOIA also requires federal agencies to make a final determination on FOIA administrative appeals that it receives within twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of such appeal, unless the agency expressly provides notice to the requester of \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d meriting additional time for responding to a FOIA request. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(ii).\r\n6. FOIA expressly provides that a person shall be deemed to have constructively exhausted their administrative remedies if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limitations provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(I) - (ii). See also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C).\r\n7. FOIA provides that any person who has not been provided the records requested pursuant to FOIA, after exhausting their administrative remedies, may seek legal redress from the Federal District Court to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant.\r\n8. Regarding the names of the FOIA requesters, the courts have held that under the FOIA requesters do not have an expectation of privacy. Stauss v. IRS, 516 F. Supp. 1218, 1223 (D.D.C. 1981),\r\n9. Under FOIA, the federal agency has the burden of sustaining its actions. 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\r\n10. Pursuant to FOIA, a Court may assess attorney fees and litigation costs against the United States if the Plaintiff prevails in an action thereunder. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E).\r\n11. Department of Justice (DOJ) has issued a handbook addressing FOIA Annual Reports. See DOJ, Handbook for Agency Annual Freedom of Information Act Reports, \u201cDisposition of FOIA Requests,\u201d (available at http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/pages/attachments/2014/11/04/department_of_justice_handbook_for_agency_annual_freedom_of_information_act_reports.pdf) (\u201cDOJ Handbook\u201d).\r\n12. Among other things, the DOJ Handbook states, \u201cAll requests (perfected and non-perfected), appeals, and consultations that were pending at any time during the relevant fiscal year [October 1st through September 30th] will be captured.\u201d\r\n13. The DOJ Handbook also states:\r\n\u201c[E]ach agency is ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of its Annual FOIA Report. It is therefore essential for agencies to take steps that will ensure that they are adequately tracking all of the information necessary to complete the Annual FOIA Report sections detailed below. Agencies that utilize a tracking or case management system for this purpose are responsible for ensuring that the system they are using can produce an accurate Annual FOIA Report that is in compliance with the law and Department of Justice guidance.\u201d DOJ Handbook, at 3.\r\n \r\nI believe that I have adequately described the records that I am seeking. If you believe that my request is unclear, if you have any questions, or if there is anything else that you need from me to complete this request in a timely manner, please contact me in writing, so that I may perfect my request.

I am also seeking a copy of this FOIA Request, which is an Agency record subject to FOIA that exists and is in the Agency\u2019s possession at the time of my FOIA request. This record is a responsive record integral to my Request. Release of the Agency\u2019s copy is not optional.\r\n \r\nREQUESTED FORMAT.\r\n \r\nI am also seeking records in their native format (MS. Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, ADA accessible PDF files by return email with: (1) a signed and dated cover letter (citing my personally assigned requester control number); (2) with record page count for all records released records (3) a copy of this request in your reply. I seek records via email in PDF format with an imbedded copy of my requests to (1) impede the agency from not addressing the FOIA Request; (2) impede the Agency from not providing the documents stated in the Agency\u2019s letter reply, and (3) make it obvious in any subsequent review what the Agency has or has not done.\r\n \r\nFurther, I request that these records be sent in any digital formats in which they exist (such as PDF and Excel).

Emails should be provided as MS Outlook files, if not encrypted or otherwise unable to be opened by me.

I am requesting that each element of the records sought be specifically addressed in the reply.\r\n \r\nIn all correspondence, return a copy of my FOIA request, cite my personal request number and cite records sought.\r\n \r\nProvide Records via Muckrock.com.\r\n \r\nFEE WAIVER/ PUBLIC INTEREST/PUBLIC RELEASE. Notwithstanding my agreement to pay fees below if my fee waiver is denied, I am seeking a fee waiver due to significant public interest in this information. The subject of the requested records concerns \"the operations or activities of the government.\u201d The disclosure is \"likely to contribute\" to an understanding of government operations or activities. There is no commercial interest. There is significant public interest.\r\n \r\nAGREEMENT TO PAY FEES.\r\n \r\nI agree to pay fees for searching or copying the records up to $25. If the fees exceed this amount, please advise me of the cost before proceeding. I do not believe that there should be any charge for providing these records, as there is public interest in government operations. I am a private individual not seeking documents for commercial use, such that the following applies: \u201cNo fees may be charged by any DoD Component if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, Components shall provide the first two hours of search time, and the first one hundred pages of duplication without charge.\u201d I would note that because I am requesting an electronic file, there should not be a per page copy fee. The OMB Guidelines direct that searches for responsive records should be done in the \"most efficient and least expensive manner.\" See OMB Fee Guidelines, 52 Fed. Reg. at 10,017. As an \u201call others\u201d requester, I may only be assessed search and duplication fees and not fees for review. See 32 CFR 286.12 - Schedule of fees. Also, please note that, should payment become necessary, the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled \"Legal tender,\" states: \" United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.\r\n( Pub. L. 97\u2013258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 980 ; Pub. L. 97\u2013452, \u00a71(19), Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat. 2477 .)\r\n \r\nEXPEDITED PROCESSING.\r\nI certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that a compelling need exists for expedited processing as discussed below:\r\n1. Records are the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\r\na. Potential bias in NARA\u2019s handling of unauthorized removal of official records by our current and prior president and other senior officials in those administrations is of great public interest, which relates to my underlying FOIA request.\r\nb. I may place this correspondence into the public domain to document NARA alleged misconduct.\r\n \r\n2. Additionally, (although a private requester) I am an individual/organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information who can prove the information is urgently needed to inform the public concerning some actual or alleged government activity. My primary activity is informing the public, which I do through a variety of means, such as open meeting public comments, blogs, etc., and I may from time to time collaborate on articles. There is extraordinary, off the charts interest in this matter and NARA\u2019s execution. I make oral public comments at every open FOAI meeting. I have an active email distribution list of Chief FOIA Officers, FOIA professionals, FOIA advocacy groups media and interested parties. I also communicate regularly with members of Congress.\r\n\u2022 See examples below.\r\n \r\n- Public Comments Submitted to the Chief FOIA Officers Council https://www.archives.gov/ogis/about-ogis/chief-foia-officers-council\r\n \r\n- Public Comments Submitted to the FOIA Advisory Committee | National Archives https://www.archives.gov/ogis/foia-advisory-committee/public-comments\r\n \r\n- OGIS Annual Open Meeting Public comments https://www.archives.gov/ogis/outreach-events/annual-open-meeting\r\n \r\n- Document Cloud.

I am seeking expedited processing due to eminent substantial loss of due process rights related to mu underlying FOIA request and appeal, which is now ripe for litigation.\r\n \r\nESTIMATED COMPLETION DATES\r\n \r\nProvide me with the initial estimated completion date (ESD) for this matter along with contemporaneous adjusted ESDs as they change. See Office of Government Information Services Advisory Opinion No. 2020-01: Agencies Must Provide Estimated Dates of Completion Upon Request https://www.archives.gov/ogis/advisory-opinions/2020-01-agencies-must-provide-edcs\r\n \r\nSTILL-INTERESTED PREEMPTIVE REPLY. This is a preemptive reply to the Justice Department guidelines the procedure known as a \u201cstill interested\u201d inquiry, through which a FOIA officer can confirm that the requester has not lost interest in obtaining the documents.\r\n \r\nMy interest in all FOIA requests and appeals submitted to your office is enduring, meaning that my interest in seeking replies to all past and future FOIA request remains in effect until each request has been answered fully and the time for judicial review has passed. Please do not initiate any \"still interested\" inquiries. This serves as my notice of enduring interest and automatic reply to any future questions of interest by your office. There are no reasonable grounds to ever conclude in the future that I am not interested in this request.\r\n \r\nImplementation Checklist for DOJ OIP Guidance on \u201cStill-Interested\u201d Inquiries\r\n1. Ensure there are reasonable grounds to make a \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry in first instance.\r\n2. Absent good cause, do not make multiple \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiries.\r\n3. Use requester\u2019s preferred method of communication and in the absence of a preference, communicate by telephone or email as the default.\r\n4. Memorialize any decision by a requester to withdraw a request that is conveyed by telephone by sending the requester a brief email or letter noting the withdrawal.\r\n5. Provide requesters no less than thirty (30) working days to respond to the \u201cstill-interested\u201d inquiry and ensure that there is a simple way to do so.\r\n6. Advise the requester that if they elect not to respond to the inquiry, the request will be administratively closed at the conclusion of the designated time period (which must be at least 30 working days).\r\n7. Prior to administratively closing a request based upon the lack of a response by the requester, make good faith efforts to reach out to the requester using multiple methods of communication.\r\n8. In the event a requester responds to the \u201cstill- interested\u201d inquiry within a reasonable time after the deadline has passed, reopen the request and place it back into the processing queue where it would have been.\r\n \r\nPRESERVE RECORDS AND SEARCHES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW.\r\n \r\nPlease search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of your searches in your FOIA case file until the statutory date for judicial review has passed (should that be necessary) or in accordance with a NARA approved records schedule, if longer. NARA GRS 4.2 requires that FOIA and Privacy Act case files be retained for 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later.\r\nRecords of responsive searches would include but not be limited to: searches conducted for each specific record sought and all other records known to the Agency, including dates, manner of searching, responsible agent or employee conducting each search and the results thereof. Such persons determining the locations of responsive records must be inclusive of persons who would know such locations and their identities and manner of determining search locations must be preserved.\r\n \r\nIn any subsequent proceedings, I may seek sworn declarations and a court order appointing a special counsel, as appropriate. Similarly, I may pursue additional venues.\r\n \r\nAny deletion of potentially responsive records by any party having knowledge of this Request may be a violation of law. In as much as applicable staff and leadership have knowledge of my subject request, the Agency must search for, locate and preserve all responsive or potentially responsive records and records of searches in their FOIA case file, and leadership must ensure that this is done. Failing to do so and allowing records to be deleted IAW any other records management schedule may be a violation of law.\r\n \r\nELECTRONIC RECORDS PRESERVATION.\r\n \r\nThe Agency must preserve all electronically stored information, copies and backup, as defined by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, along with any paper files which the Agency maintains, relevant to this action I am seeking electronic data in the Agency\u2019s custody and control that is relevant to this action, including without limitation emails, along with metadata, and other information contained on Agency computer systems and any electronic storage systems. I consider this electronic data and paper files to be valuable and irreplaceable sources of discoverable information in this matter. No procedures should have been implemented to alter any active, deleted or fragmented data. Moreover, no electronic data should have been disposed of or destroyed. (ETL Institute for Advancement of America\u2019s Legal System).\r\n \r\nFurther, to properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction, electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift or destruction of hardware. Notify all individuals and of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. (2008 Thomson Delmar Learning).\r\n \r\nThe Agency\u2019s Director of Information Operations or similar organization must initiate procedures to preserve electronic records.\r\n \r\nAPPLICABLE RETENTION SCHEDULE, NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n \r\n020 Access and disclosure request files. Case files created in response to requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) process, Privacy Act (PA), Classification Challenge, and similar access programs, and completed by: \u2022 granting the request in full \u2022 granting the request in part \u2022 denying the request for any reason including: o inability to fulfill request because records do not exist o inability to fulfill request because request inadequately describes records o inability to fulfill request because search or reproduction fees are not paid Temporary. Destroy 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later, but longer retention is authorized if required for business use.

FOIA requires that each agency shall \u201cestablish a telephone line or Internet service that provides information about the status of a request to the person making the request using the assigned tracking number, including the date on which the agency originally received the request; and an estimated date on which the agency will complete action on the request. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)(7)(B).\r\n5. FOIA also requires federal agencies to make a final determination on FOIA administrative appeals that it receives within twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of such appeal, unless the agency expressly provides notice to the requester of \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d meriting additional time for responding to a FOIA request. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(ii).\r\n6. FOIA expressly provides that a person shall be deemed to have constructively exhausted their administrative remedies if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limitations provided by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(I) - (ii). See also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(C).\r\n7. FOIA provides that any person who has not been provided the records requested pursuant to FOIA, after exhausting their administrative remedies, may seek legal redress from the Federal District Court to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant.\r\n8. Regarding the names of the FOIA requesters, the courts have held that under the FOIA requesters do not have an expectation of privacy. Stauss v. IRS, 516 F. Supp. 1218, 1223 (D.D.C. 1981),\r\n9. Under FOIA, the federal agency has the burden of sustaining its actions. 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).\r\n10. Pursuant to FOIA, a Court may assess attorney fees and litigation costs against the United States if the Plaintiff prevails in an action thereunder. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E).\r\n11. Department of Justice (DOJ) has issued a handbook addressing FOIA Annual Reports. See DOJ, Handbook for Agency Annual Freedom of Information Act Reports, \u201cDisposition of FOIA Requests,\u201d (available at http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/pages/attachments/2014/11/04/department_of_justice_handbook_for_agency_annual_freedom_of_information_act_reports.pdf) (\u201cDOJ Handbook\u201d).\r\n12. Among other things, the DOJ Handbook states, \u201cAll requests (perfected and non-perfected), appeals, and consultations that were pending at any time during the relevant fiscal year [October 1st through September 30th] will be captured.\u201d\r\n13. The DOJ Handbook also states:\r\n\u201c[E]ach agency is ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of its Annual FOIA Report. It is therefore essential for agencies to take steps that will ensure that they are adequately tracking all of the information necessary to complete the Annual FOIA Report sections detailed below. Agencies that utilize a tracking or case management system for this purpose are responsible for ensuring that the system they are using can produce an accurate Annual FOIA Report that is in compliance with the law and Department of Justice guidance.\u201d DOJ Handbook, at 3.\r\n \r\nI believe that I have adequately described the records that I am seeking. If you believe that my request is unclear, if you have any questions, or if there is anything else that you need from me to complete this request in a timely manner, please contact me in writing, so that I may perfect my request. If you deem that any portion of my request is unclear, answer the remaining portions and I will perfect a request for additional material as needed.\r\n \r\nThank you very much in advance.\r\n \r\nWith my respect,\r\n \r\n/s/\r\nRobert Hammond\r\nRequester\r\nWhistleblower\r\n \r\nReferences:\r\n(a) The Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq., as amended,\r\n(b) Joint publication of U.S. Department of Justice, Executive Office of the President and U.S. General Services Administration of July 2011, \u201cYour Right to Federal Records\u201d\r\n(c) The Privacy Act (\u201cPA\u201d) of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, et seq., as amended\r\n(d) DoD 5400.11-R, May 14, 2007, Department of Defense Privacy Program\r\n(e) DoD 5400.7-R, September 1998, DoD Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program\r\n(f) DoD 6025.18-R, Jan. 24, 2003, DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation\r\n(g) GAO Report GAO-12-828 of July 2012, subject Freedom of Information Act\r\n(h) Department of Justice Handbook for Agency Annual Freedom of Information Act Reports\r\n(i) (b) Administrative Instruction 106, \u201cAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program,\u201d January 30, 2014\r\n(j) DoD Directive 5145.01, \u201cGeneral Counsel of the Department of Defense (GC DoD),\u201d December 2, 2013, as amended\r\n(k) DoD Directive 5145.04, \u201cDefense Legal Services Agency (DLSA),\u201d April 16, 2012\r\n(l) (f) DoD Directive 5400.11, \u201cDoD Privacy Program,\u201d October 29, 2014\r\n(m) DoD Manual 8910.01, Volume 1, \u201cDoD Information Collections Manual: Procedures for DoD Internal Information Collections,\u201d June 30, 2014\r\n(n) Executive Order 12988, \u201cCivil Justice Reform,\u201d February 5, 1996\r\n(o) Public Law 101-552, \u201cAdministrative Dispute Resolution Act,\u201d November 15, 1990\r\n(p) Public Law 104\u2013320, \u201cAdministrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996,\u201d October 19, 1996\r\n(q) Presidential Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, \u201cDesignation of Interagency Committees to Facilitate and Encourage Agency Use of Alternate Means of Dispute Resolution and Negotiated Rulemaking,\u201d May 1, 1998\r\n(r) United States Code, Title 5\r\n(s) DoD Instruction 5145.05, \u201cAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and Conflict Management\u201d\r\n(t) Alternate Dispute Resolution Handbook (opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/employee-relations/employee-rights-appeals/alternative-dispute-resolution/handbook.pdf)\r\n(u) President Obama's FOIA Memorandum and Attorney General Holder's FOIA Guidelines (justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/legacy/2014/07/23/foia-memorandum.pdf)\r\n \r\n\u2003\r\n# Hammond Public Comments.

This includes \u201cMy new idea is to transfer the currently poorly-executed OGIS and DOJ OIP FOIA compliance and audit functions to GAO \u2013 which is a great fit for GAO \u2013 while OGIS and DOJ OIP retain their current funding.\u201d \r\n\r\nKirstin, Bobby, Alina, \r\n\r\nWhen I type in the chat to read a question or comment, I expect you to read it and not inaccurately paraphrase it and then dodge the question. \r\nThat was not wise.\r\n\r\nFor example, I typed into the chat: \u201cOGIS certified meeting minutes impermissibly excludes/redacts meeting participants, while Chief FOIA Officers Council participants are not.\u201d Kirsten did not read the question but preemptively stated:\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is Kirsten Mitchell, the designated federal officer. There was another comment regarding minutes of these meetings. And when I say \"these meetings,\" the FOIA Advisory Committee and the Chief FOIA Officer Council. Those are two separate bodies. I just want to put on the record that FOIA Advisory Committee minutes are governed by the federal advisory committee act. Chief FOIA officer council minutes are governed by the information act. It's required it contain a record of the person's presence. The federal advisory committee act does not have that requirement. Chief FOIA officer council minutes are governed by the information act. It's required it contain a record of the person's presence.

Bobby, if you state again that you are well supported, I may release my multiple emails between us where you claim severe resource deficiencies as a reason for not being able to handle compliance inquiries. \r\n\r\nThe FY 2022 NARA budget request for OGIS was \u201c$1,864 thousand for the Office of Government Information Services.\u201d  FY 2024 =  $1,963 thousand for the Office of Government Information Services; This is an increase of 5%, while inflation was 9.8%. No new request or \u201cjustification\u201d for increased personnel or resources. You people are struggling, agencies and requesters are adversely impacted. OGIS missions are statutory missions, which should go to the very top of NARA\u2019s priorities.

I may distribute the attachments as well.\r\n\r\n--/\r\nYou also dodged the question about why you disable the YouTube comments.

One question for agencies is for them to identify their processes for FOIA reporting and why every year they change their annual FOIA report data for the preceding year. DOJ OIP FOIA.gov quarterly and annual FOIA data is massively false and everyone knows it.

RE - NGC23-504_Final_Response\r\nImportance: High\r\n\r\nGreetings FOIA Advisory Committee members!\r\nPlease see attached and below.\r\nThe crux of this matter is that NARA\u2019s OGIS impermissibly altered the June 8, 2023 certified meeting transcripts to remove my questions about the needed level of funding for OGIS and DOJ OIP to execute their missions, which Ms. Semo refused to address. Then, Ms. Semo omitted that material question from the certified meeting minutes.\r\nNARA appears to have run afoul of multiple federal laws and DOJ OIP policy, which I am addressing aggressively \u2013 attempting to halt this abuse.\r\nAdditionally, NARA redacted the identities of those who registered for the meeting under exemption B6 (Privacy), while NARA/DOJ OIP provide complete listings for Chief FOIA Officer Council meetings.\r\nFinally, NARA claims that it cannot locate any records of the all-panelist chat comments, which they are required to preserve under FACA and the FOIA Advisory Committee Bylaws. I have recommended (among other changes) that the bylaws be changed to include the list of participants. \r\nI know that you are all extremely busy (as am I). I am sending you examples of [seemingly] gross malfeasance in FOIA processes for information, because I believe that the greatest benefit of this Committee\u2019s term is to address the day-to-day issues that FOIA requesters \u2013 particularly private requester without the benefit of extensive legal staffs- experience every day.\r\nYou are doing extraordinary work \u2013 particularly with the B5 model letter. Later, I will provide input for doing the same thing with Exemption B6, which is equally abused \u2013 often with B5 applied to the same redaction withholding. Clarity in the determination letters of what the standards are for each claimed exemption and how the agency purports to have met the standards \u2013 along with a clear articulation of exactly what the foreseeable harm is- are paramount in leveling the playing field and discouraging frivolous redaction/withholding.\r\n--/\r\nNew subject. \r\nAs you know I have been advocating for increased funding for OGIS and DOJ OIP for years, while NARA and DOJ refuse to seek such additional funding in their budgets.\r\nMy new idea is to remove FOIA compliance oversight and auditing from OGIS and DOJ OIP and transfer those functions to GAO (in coordination with Congress) with direct funding from Congress. Then, OGIS and DOJ OIP keep their same funding with reduces missions. OGIS mediation mission conflicts with FOIA compliance (and OGIS disclaims any responsibility for compliance), while DOJ OIP is the appellate authority for DOJ and defends federal agencies in FOIA litigation. OGIS would instantly double the staff available for mediation.\r\nOversight/audit of executive branch functions is an appropriate GAO mission and GAO is routinely asked to conduct FOIA audits. Perhaps, some OGIS and OIP personnel would transfer to GAO, but I think OGIS and OIP should keep their budgets intact. We may find support in Congress for this given the combative FOIA hearings every couple of years. \r\n--/\r\nWith my respect,\r\n\r\nRobert (Bob) Hammond\r\nPrivate Citizen FOIA Advocate\r\n\r\nFrom: [Hammond]\r\nSent: Tuesday, September 5, 2023 5:15 PM\r\nTo: 'OIP.ComplianceInquiry@usdoj.gov' <OIP.ComplianceInquiry@usdoj.gov>; 'bobak.Talebian@usdoj.gov' <bobak.Talebian@usdoj.gov>; 'lindsay.Steel@usdoj.gov' <lindsay.Steel@usdoj.gov>; 'unauthorizeddisposition@nara.gov' <unauthorizeddisposition@nara.gov>; 'archivistoftheunitedstates@nara.gov' <archivistoftheunitedstates@nara.gov>\r\nCc: 'NARA General Counsel FOIA Office' <foia@nara.gov>; 'ashley.bryan@nara.gov' <ashley.bryan@nara.gov>; 'Vanita.Gupta; 'bobak.Talebian@usdoj.gov' <bobak.Talebian@usdoj.gov>; 'sheena.burrell@nara.gov' <sheena.burrell@nara.gov>; 'alina.semo@nara.gov' <alina.semo@nara.gov>\r\nSubject: DOJ OIP, NARA FPL, and NARA Unauthorized Records Destruction (UD,) NARA OIG (Complaint).

Your duplicate requests, dated July 12, 2023 and July 13, 2023, were received by the Office of General Counsel (NGC) on the same dates, via foia@nara.gov. In your FOIA request you stated you are seeking:\r\n\r\n\u2026 I am respectfully seeking:\r\n1.\tRecords of all persons who registered via Eventbrite to attend the meeting.\r\n2.\tAll records of the June 8, 2023 Webex Chat comments which the Meeting Minutes certified by Alina states: Ms. Mitchell stated that Committee chat comments have been read into the record and reiterated the comment from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission FOIA professional about the Exemption 5 privilege issue that a global policy of citing the specific privilege would create efficiencies across government.\r\nMr. Levenson confirmed that there were no additional chat comments.\r\n3.\tRecords include but are not limited to \u201call panelist\u201d chat comments as well as any direct comments to any member participating in the meeting, including OGIS support personnel and the conference moderator. Ms. Semo\u2019s certified meeting minutes cite the following persons participating in the virtual meeting: ...\r\n\r\nYou also asked for a fee waiver and expedited processing.\r\n\r\nAfter conducting a search, we located one document responsive to part 1 of your request. We are releasing the document in part with redactions pursuant to Freedom of Information Act, 5\r\nU.S.C. \u00a7552(b)(6). Exemption (b)(6) protects the release of information the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe conducted a search for records responsive to part 2 of your request asking for the June 8, 2023 Webex Chat comments. However, we were unable to locate records responsive to your request. Your request for expedited processing was responded to on July 31, 2023. Your request for a fee waiver is considered non-billable.\r\n\r\nThis completes the processing of your FOIA request.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with our action on this request, you have the right to file an administrative appeal within ninety (90) calendar days from the date of this letter via regular U.S. mail or\r\nemail. By filing an appeal, you preserve your rights under FOIA and give the agency a chance to review and reconsider your request and the agency\u2019s decision. If you submit your appeal in writing, please address it to the Deputy Archivist of the United States (ND), National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740. Both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked \u201cFreedom of Information Act Appeal.\u201d If you submit your appeal by email, please send it to FOIA@nara.gov, also addressed to the Deputy Archivist of the United States. Please be sure to explain why you believe this response does not meet the requirements of the FOIA. All correspondence should reference your case tracking number NGC23-504.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss our response before filing an appeal to attempt to resolve your dispute without going through the appeals process, you may contact our FOIA Public Liaison Gary M. Stern for assistance at:\r\n\r\nNational Archives and Records Administration 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 3110\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001 301-837-1750\r\ngarym.stern@nara.gov\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to resolve your FOIA dispute through our FOIA Public Liaison, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), the Federal FOIA Ombudsman\u2019s office, offers mediation services to help resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies.

ALLEGATION.\r\n\r\n\u201cA member of the public (Robert Hammond) alleges that the Archivist of the United States and the NARA Director of Government Information Services may have destroyed FOIA Advisory Committee records of a June 8, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee meeting, which it is mandated to have preserved under the Federal Advisory Committee Act and other laws regulations and policies :\r\n\r\n \u201call panelist\u201d chat comments as well as any direct comments to any member participating in the meeting, including OGIS support personnel and the conference moderator. This includes Committee members present at the virtual meeting. Others present or participating in the virtual meeting, including all registered participants\u201d \r\n\r\nElse records are at risk of actual, impending, or threatened damage, alienation, or unauthorized destruction.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sought the above records via FOIA to NARA (NCG23- 504) on the third day following the meeting. In its FOIA response two months later, NARA admits that they destroyed the records:\r\n\r\n\t\u201cNo records were found responsive to part 1 of your request.\u201d\r\n\r\n See Attachment A and Attachment B\r\n\r\nII. ACTION SOUGHT. \r\n\r\n1.\tNotify NARA within 5 business days as required by 36 CFR 1230.16.a.\r\n2.\tProvide me with a point of contact by return email to discuss this matter.\r\n3.\tPermit me to discuss the Agency\u2019s reply prior to deciding on this complaint to preclude the likely provision of misinformation, as has been done in the past.\r\n4.\tIf the records have not been destroyed, seek that the Agency provide them to you as individual records.\r\n5.\tImmediately post this UD complaint to the NARA website. In violation of law NARA has refused to post UD complaints against NARA. See Attachment E.\r\n\r\nIII. UD COMPLAINT IN PUBLIC DOMAIN. \r\n\r\nIn violation of  36 CFR 1230 and the Administrative Procedures Act, NARA refuses to post and properly investigate prior complaints relating to NARA including an October 7, 2022 allegation that NARA destroyed records related to potential Hatch Act violations by the then Acting Archivist of the United States (Debra Wall) sought under FOIA (and others). NARA must demand the production to NARA of any records the agency claims it did not destroy.\r\n\r\nThis uneven application of law is particularly important given that NARA\u2019s Unauthorized Records Disposition Unit is at the center of two criminal investigations regarding unauthorized removal/retention of Presidential records by our current and former presidents.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I will be distributing this UD complaint widely. I may address past UD complaints where NARA has utterly failed in its responsibilities. NARA\u2019s unauthorized records dispositions are overseen by Chief Records Officer Laurence Brewer laurence.brewer@nara.gov\r\n\r\nIV.

        "communication": "Gary Stern, NARA FOIA Public Liaison,\r\nWhat is the status of my September 5, 2023 5:15 PM request for FPL assistance in this matter?\r\n\r\nFPL assistance is independent of the IDA letter.\r\n\r\nI am also seeking FPL dispute resolution regarding the matters in my attached Unauthorized Disposition complaint per below and attached.\r\n\r\nDecember 11, 2023\r\n\r\nSubject: NARA Unauthorized Disposition (UD) Complaint ICO June 8, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee Meeting\r\n\r\nI. ALLEGATION.\r\n\r\n\u201cA member of the public (Robert Hammond) alleges that the Archivist of the United States and the NARA Director of Government Information Services may have destroyed FOIA Advisory Committee records of a June 8, 2023 FOIA Advisory Committee meeting, which it is mandated to have preserved under the Federal Advisory Committee Act and other laws regulations and policies :\r\n\r\n\u201call panelist\u201d chat comments as well as any direct comments to any member participating in the meeting, including OGIS support personnel and the conference moderator. This includes Committee members present at the virtual meeting. Others present or participating in the virtual meeting, including all registered participants\u201d\r\n\r\nElse records are at risk of actual, impending, or threatened damage, alienation, or unauthorized destruction.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sought the above records via FOIA to NARA (NCG23- 504) on the third day following the meeting. In its FOIA response two months later, NARA admits that they destroyed the records:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo records were found responsive to part 1 of your request.\u201d\r\n\r\nSee Attachment A and Attachment B\r\n\r\nII. ACTION SOUGHT.\r\n\r\n1. Notify NARA within 5 business days as required by 36 CFR 1230.16.a.\r\n2. Provide me with a point of contact by return email to discuss this matter.\r\n3. Permit me to discuss the Agency\u2019s reply prior to deciding on this complaint to preclude the likely provision of misinformation, as has been done in the past.\r\n4. If the records have not been destroyed, seek that the Agency provide them to you as individual records.\r\n5. Immediately post this UD complaint to the NARA website. In violation of law NARA has refused to post UD complaints against NARA. See Attachment E.\r\n\r\nIII. UD COMPLAINT IN PUBLIC DOMAIN.\r\n\r\nIn violation of 36 CFR 1230 and the Administrative Procedures Act, NARA refuses to post and properly investigate prior complaints relating to NARA including an October 7, 2022 allegation that NARA destroyed records related to potential Hatch Act violations by the then Acting Archivist of the United States (Debra Wall) sought under FOIA (and others). NARA must demand the production to NARA of any records the agency claims it did not destroy.\r\n\r\nThis uneven application of law is particularly important given that NARA\u2019s Unauthorized Records Disposition Unit is at the center of two criminal investigations regarding unauthorized removal/retention of Presidential records by our current and former presidents.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I will be distributing this UD complaint widely. I may address past UD complaints where NARA has utterly failed in its responsibilities. NARA\u2019s unauthorized records dispositions are overseen by Chief Records Officer Laurence Brewer laurence.brewer@nara.gov\r\n\r\nIV. NARA GRS 4.2 Item 20\r\n\r\n020 Access and disclosure request files. Case files created in response to requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) process, Privacy Act (PA), Classification Challenge, and similar access programs, and completed by: \u2022 granting the request in full \u2022 granting the request in part \u2022 denying the request for any reason including: o inability to fulfill request because records do not exist o inability to fulfill request because request inadequately describes records o inability to fulfill request because search or reproduction fees are not paid Temporary. Destroy 6 years after final agency action or 3 years after final adjudication by the courts, whichever is later, but longer retention is authorized if required for business use.

In NARA\u2019s responsive record xxx NARA redacted the identities of those who registered for the meeting, including \u201cGretchen Gehrke, public commenter.\u201d\r\na.\tThere is no expectation of privacy for members of the public participating in an open FOIA meeting.\r\nb.\tThe FACA and FOIA Advisory Committee Bylaws require that such records be preserved and made available to the public. See paragraph 5 above.\r\nc.\tNARA/DOJ OIP publishes in the Chief FOIA Officers Council meeting minutes, \u201c Registered Attendees (This list consists of individuals who registered to attend the meeting).

NARA\u2019s response letter improperly truncates my FOIA request records sought early into the third paragraph (stating\u2026) and completely omitted material records of paragraphs four. See my attached : Expedited FOIA Request NARA 23-F. Muckrock. FOIA Advisory Committee June 8, 2023 Chat Comments. \r\na.\tPresumably, NARA did not like the content or intend to reply.\r\nb.\tParagraph three lists persons who participated in the meeting including redacting \u201cGretchen Gehrke, public commenter,\u201d which NARA redacted in its released June_8.2023_FAC_Meeting_Attendee_Summary_-_Redaction_Proposals records \r\nc.\tNARA\u2019s reply creates an official record for appeal and judicial review. In litigation, agencies refer to such agency created records rather than the original records, thereby misleading the courts.\r\nd.\tSee my public comments to the FOIA Advisory Committee, \u201cDraft Proposed Model Agency B5 Determination Letter - Comment #2\u201d at DocumentCloud  https://www.documentcloud.org/app?q=%2Buser%3Arobert-hammond-106693%20 \r\n\r\n10.\tUnlawful Withholding.  Without any basis for withholding (because there is none), NARA impermissibly withheld.\r\n\r\n11.\tSeemingly materially false official statement #2 \u2013 certified meeting minutes. \u201cMs. Mitchell stated that Committee chat comments have been read into the record and reiterated the comment from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission FOIA professional about the Exemption 5 privilege issue that a global policy of citing the specific privilege would create efficiencies across government. Mr. Levenson confirmed that there were no additional chat comments.\u201d\r\n\r\na.\tClearly, the statement, \u201cCommittee chat comments have been read into the record\u201d is materially false. \r\nb.\tClearly, the statement, \u201cMr. Levenson confirmed that there were no additional chat comments.\u201d is materially false.\r\n\r\nWith my respect,\r\n\r\nRobert Hammond\r\n\r\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nA copy of any FBI files on Daniel Ellsberg. Born April 7, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois, Daniel Ellsberg died June 16, 2023 in Kensington, California. He was America's most famous whistleblower. His death at age 92 was widely reported in the media in June, 2023. He was the husband of the American journalist Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He is also known by the name Dan Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nRecords relating to or mentioning Daniel Ellsberg. Major media outlets across America as of June 16th, 2023 have reported his death including: https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/06/16/daniel-ellsberg-pentagon-papers-dead/ https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/16/us/daniel-ellsberg-dead.html\r\n\r\nPlease conduct searches of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the SENTINEL system, FBI email system, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Records System, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, Counter-drug Information Indices System (CIIS), Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) including but not limited to Investigative Data Warehouse - Secret, IDW-S Core, SPT, and DOCLAB-S, FBI Automated Case Support system (ACS), subset of the Electronic Case File (ECF) system, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), Interstate Photo System (IPS) and/or Facial Recognition Databases such as those used by FACE (Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation) specialists, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications and/or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) record filings, for both main-file records and cross-reference records for all relevant names, individuals, agencies and companies. Please further consult all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other data sources containing potentially-responsive materials related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, investigations, inquiries, audio files, photographs or image files, video files, memos, email systems, directives, network packet captures, meeting minute notes, calendar entries, and any other data or data format that is used by the FBI. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, code names, nicknames, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency or any other agency that is known to the FBI. Please additionally include searches for inter-agency or non-agency communications accessible by the FBI about Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the Bureau has no other copies of said records. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, which remain technically under your agency\u2019s control (see 36 CFR 1250.8). Please also conduct a search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for records related to Daniel Ellsberg.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I request the FOIA log and copies of all other requests for information on Daniel Ellsberg including the responsive documents.\r\n\r\nDaniel Ellsberg was a public figure. This request is a critical part of a journalistic research project which requires the responsive documents for informing the public.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJacob Appelbaum",

I see that in the reply that contains these previously released documents, additional records that are responsive to my request exist. I am writing to confirm within the allotted thirty day window that this material does not satisfy my request as most of the documents are more than forty years old, and many are much older. I understand that Dr. Daniel Ellsberg continued to be of interest to the FBI long after the early 1980s. I request that the additional records about my requested subject be processed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance in this matter.",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\n1 - I have never requested a record from your agency before. Thank you for your consideration to others in previous requests submitted via the MuckRock platform, but I was not involved. I have no expectation that requests will always be free. On the contrary, I am very familiar with the search/retrieval/redaction fees permitted by statute and expect they will be assessed. That is not the case here.\r\n\r\n2 - Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 30-4-30(B), regarding copy fees, they \"may not apply to records that are transmitted in an electronic format\". Attempting to charge paper copy fees for an electronic record is clearly prohibited, whether or not they are \"agency copy\" fees or copies provided to the requester.\r\n\r\n3 - Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 30-4-30(B), fees may be assessed for \"search, retrieval, or redaction of records\". Certainly redacting electronic records electronically is more efficient and cost-effective. Fees must be \"reasonable\" and \"the records must be furnished at the lowest possible cost to the person requesting the records\". The statute does not permit the assessment of fees to satisfy an internal mandate of filing all records related to FOIA requests on paper. \r\n\r\n4 - Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 30-4-50(A)(2), \"administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public\" are inherently public record. I am unclear as to what information would even be subject to redaction in the requested records. If any redaction is required, the charge would be for the staff time to perform the redactions, not for paper copies of the record or for time spent researching what content is exempt.\r\n\r\n5 - I will go ahead and request a full waiver of all fees now. The policies and procedures of a law enforcement agency are of paramount public interest and these records will be made available to the public. As previously noted, the three other large law enforcement agencies in the county already publish their policies on their respective web sites at no charge. I am not aware of any redactions any of these agencies have made. Perhaps the Sheriff would be interested in bringing CCSO's level of transparency up to the level of neighboring departments? She stated in a press conference less than a week ago \"...we care about policing, transparency, and the safety of this community\".\r\n\r\nMount Pleasant Police Department's Policies/Procedures are 740 pages and 20.5MB. A reasonable estimate of the size of CCSO's policies based on the quoted 1683 pages is 46.62MB, but let's just say it's 100MB for simplicity. A 128GB USB drive is $12 on Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-Flair-128GB-Flash/dp/B015CH1PJU?th=1). Instead of printing the 1683 pages and producing a paper file for ~$336, you can use this USB drive for $12, use it to file all records related to this request, and still have room on the USB drive for 4.7 million more pages! Imagine how many trees (and FOIA requesters' and taxpayers' money) you can save! Demonstrating my commitment to a practical solution, I offer to cover the cost of the USB drive's storage space for the portion utilized for this request - 9/10ths of one cent (I'll round it up).\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response and an amicable resolution. Thanks,\r\n\r\nPatrick Wells",

Many times, there is someone within a department pulling files, making copies, and putting them on my desk. That may not always be the case, this is why there is an estimate and only 25% is charged up front.\r\nI will speak to our general counsel about this as she is the one that has made it clear to our office that some redactions are required. It has not been made clear to me exactly what they wish to redact and from which policies, so I am uncertain of the amount of time that may be required to redact the roughly 180 policies.\r\n\r\nKarli Maratea\n",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",
