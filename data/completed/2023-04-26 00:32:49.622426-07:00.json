Organizations wishing to participate in the mobility program must first submit request for certification packets to the agency with which they seek to partner. Detailed descriptions of the IPA Mobility Program, its rules and regulations, and the documentation participating agencies must maintain can be found here: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/#url=Provisions.\r\n\r\n2) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the organizations currently approved by your agency to participate in the IPA mobility program. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide your agency's approval letter for each organization.\r\n\r\n 3) A list, roster, database, or comparable record documenting all of the IPA mobility program assignments approved by your agency since Jan. 1, 2020. If a list, roster, database, or similar record containing responsive information is not available, I ask that you provide assignment agreement documents for each assignment. Please note: I understand and accept that some information\u2014namely, SSN, address, DOB\u2014would have to be redacted from the assignment agreements. It is for this reason that I've requested the records in formats that are easy to filter or redact. \r\n\r\nI request expedited processing of this request under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II). I am a working journalist and I intend to use the requested records to \"[engage] in disseminating information ... to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.\"\r\n\r\nI also ask that all fees be waived as I intend to use the requested records to publish articles in the public interest and not for any commercial purpose. In the event you choose to impose fees, I request a detailed breakdown of the fees, including the hourly wage of each employee involved and an explanation justifying the employee hours required to fulfill the request.\r\n\r\nShould you choose to reject this request or redact portions of it, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation and citations to the statutory exemptions and associated case law underlying your decision to withhold each/any portions from public review.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

We appreciate OIG FOIA being in communication about it. \r\n\r\nAs a show of amicability, why doesn\u2019t the agency start by stating how many responsive records it estimates would be generated by running searches for all responsive records. Then we can speak about narrowing based on facts, rather than speculation. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the simplest way to do this would be to arrive at a universe of records that might be responsive. To do that, printouts (without identifying information) of number the closed substantiated and closed unsubstantiated cases responsive to the request would be really helpful. \r\n\r\nIs that possible?\r\n\r\nThank you again for reaching out. \r\n\r\nAndrew Free\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative\r\nAl Otro Lado ",

Therefore we're seek your amicability\r\n\r\nItems #4 and #5 -\r\n\r\nPlease note, the program office conducting search for responsive records doesn't track cases as \"substantiated\" or \"un-substantiated\".\r\n\r\nWe are consequently asking for:\r\n\r\n  *   A combining of both items#4 and #5,\r\n  *   Modification of request to all responsive Reports of Investigation and supporting documents for the last 3 months of Fiscal Year (FY) 21 (July, August, September 2021),\r\n  *   An indication of a particular topic/subject of interest to you such as particular incidents at a detention facility.\r\n\r\nItem #8 -\r\nThere are 856 cases.  A minimum estimate of 25 pages or more per case.  The results of 856 cases is over 21,000 pages.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nOverview\r\nThis seeks DHS-OIG agency records regarding Contractor Notifications to the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General that are required by 48 C.F.R. 52.222-50(d)(1) and (2), as incorporated by contract, regarding allegations of forced labor at civil immigration detention facilities operated by contractors of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These Contractor Notifications are required by federal law when the contractor receives credible information regarding violations of the forced labor provisions of the TVPA, 18 U.S.C. 1589, including those arising from alleged forced labor. See 48 C.F.R. 52.222-50(b)(3). The Contractor Notification requirement is incorporated into every federal detention contract at issue in this request as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nSince the Contractor Notification regulations took effect, ICE's two largest federal government detention contractors - CoreCivic, Inc. and The GEO Group, Inc. - have been found by federal courts to have plausibly engaged in forced labor violations at nearly all of their facilities nationwide. See Owino v. CoreCivic, Inc., No. 17-cv-1112, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58268 (S.D. Cal. 2020) (certifying a nationwide forced labor class for CoreCivic's civil immigration detention facilities), Novoa v. The GEO Group, Inc., No. 5:17-cv-2514-JGB-SHK, Dkt. No. 223 (C.D. Cal. 2019) (certifying a nationwide forced labor class for most of GEO's civil immigration detention facilities) available at https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-CA-0142-0006.pdf. In addition, federal judges in five separate U.S. district courts have denied efforts by these contractors to dismiss TVPA forced labor claims raised by current or former ICE detainees. See Owino v. CoreCivic, Inc., 2018 WL 2193644 (S.D. Cal. May 14, 2018); Gonzalez v. CoreCivic, Inc., No. 1:18-cv-169 (W.D. Tex. Feb. 22, 2018), ECF No. 29 (Order Denying Motion to Dismiss), at 4-5; Novoa v. GEO Grp., Inc., EDCV 17-2514 (SHKx), 2018 WL 3343494 (C.D. Cal. June 21, 2018) (same); Menocal v. Geo Grp., Inc., 113 F. Supp. 3d 1125, 1131-33 (D. Colo. 2015) (same). \r\n\r\nTogether, CoreCivic and GEO house up to 60% of the civilly detained immigrants held by ICE on any given day, and receive the majority of federal immigration detention contract funds appropriated by Congress. Their market share in these contracts, and ICE's Congressionally-appropriate total number of detention beds more broadly, has grown approximately 50% in the past 3 1/2 years. Yet neither ICE's Contracting Officers nor DHS-OIG appear to have taken any of the actions required by law. See 48 C.F.R. 52.222-50(g). \r\n\r\nIn 2019, the Solicitor General of the United States informed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Barrientos v. CoreCivic, Inc., No. 18-15081. 951 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2020), that ICE and the DOJ consider the forced labor provisions to apply to private detention contractors' work programs, and opined that where those contractors violate ICE's contractually binding Performance-Based National Detention StandardsPreviously (PBNDS). The Solicitor General's Amicus Brief in support of neither party specifically referenced the Executive Order which gave rise to the insertion of the Contractor Notification requirement into the Federal Acquisition Regulations for all domestic federal contracts. See Strengthening Protections Against Trafficking in Persons in Federal Contracts, 77 Fed. Reg. 600029, 60030 (\"Sec. 2. Anti-Trafficking Provisions. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Administrator for the United States Agency for International Development, and the heads of such other executive departments and agencies (agencies) as the FAR Council determines to be appropriate, shall take steps necessary to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to:\r\n(1) strengthen the efficacy of the Government\u2019s zero-tolerance policy on trafficking in persons by Federal contractors and subcontractors in solicitations, contracts, and subcontracts for supplies or services (including construction and commercial items), by: . . . (C) requiring contracting officers to notify, in accordance with agency procedures, the agency\u2019s Inspector General, the agency official responsible for initiating suspension or debarment actions, and law enforcement, if appropriate, if they become aware of any activities that would justify termination under section 106(g) of the TVPA, 22 U.S.C. 7104(g), or are inconsistent with the requirements of this order or any other applicable law or regulation establishing restrictions on trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor, and further requiring that the agency official responsible for initiating suspension and debarment actions consider whether suspension or debarment is necessary in order to protect the Government\u2019s interest[.])\" I\r\n\r\nPreviously, the Office of Inspector General faulted ICE for failing to adequately oversee some DHS contracts: https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2019-07/OIG-19-50-Jul19.pdf, and for failing to use available contracting tools to achieve compliance with the PBNDS: https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2019-02/OIG-19-18-Jan19.pdf. \r\n\r\nIn 2017, DHS-OIG specifically notified ICE that the policies of requiring immigrant detainees to clean common living areas for no remuneration, as opposed to their immediate living areas, violates the PBNDS: https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2017/OIG-17-43-MA-030617.pdf at p. 6 (\" Additionally, requiring detainees to clean common areas used by all detainees is in violation of ICE standards, as detainees are only required to clean their immediate living area.\"). ICE concurred with all three OIG recommendations in that report, and committed to resolving them.\r\n\r\nDescription of Records Requested\r\n1. All Contractor Notifications to DHS-OIG from any ICE contractor, including, but not limited to, The GEO Group, Inc. and CoreCivic, Inc., regarding credible information that its agents have engaged in forced labor violations. \r\n2. All DHS-OIG agency records received pursuant to 48 C.F.R. 52-222-50(g).\r\n3. All DHS-OIG agency records pertaining to any actions taken upon receiving such Contractor Notifications. \r\n\r\nPursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.4(b), we request records that should have been received by DHS-OIG from GEO at the time the Menocal v. The GEO Group, Inc. litigation was filed in the District of Colorado on October 22, 2014, or, at the very least after the District of Colorado ruled the allegations in Menocal of forced labor violations were plausible in 2015. The same dates of receipt corresponding to the filing and district court decision dates of the Owino, Gonzalez, and Novoa class actions should be used to formulate the search. It is believed that OIG _MAY_ have been forwarded these notifications by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Office of Acquisition Management (OAQ) Contracting Officer for each relevant contract. However, because the binding regulation requires direct notification to DHS-OIG, we believe there should be records received by OIG directly from the contractors themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nPursuant to 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e)(1)(iv), I request expedited processing of this request. The issue of DHS contractors' alleged use of forced labor in ICE's civil immigration detention facilities has been the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest, and there are significant questions regarding ICE and OIG's responses to those allegations which affect public confidence. \r\n\r\n A representative sampling of the media stories we rely upon for the proposition that these allegations have been the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest follows: \r\n1. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/05/thousands-of-ice-detainees-claim-they-were-forced-into-labor-a-violation-of-anti-slavery-laws/\r\n2. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/opinion/forced-labor-immigrants.html\r\n3. https://www.westword.com/news/geo-lawsuit-alleging-forced-labor-of-immigrant-detainees-moves-forward-6886851\r\n4. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/25/private-prison-companies-served-with-lawsuits-over-usng-detainee-labor\r\n5. https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/emails-in-lawsuit-suggest-geo-group-forces-ice-detainees-to-work-11310005\r\n6. https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/09/584722399/appeals-court-broadens-immigrant-detainee-case-alleging-forced-labor\r\n7. https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-immigrant-workers-20170305-story.html\r\n8. https://www.wsj.com/articles/detention-operators-face-suits-over-1-a-day-work-programs-for-migrants-1532170801\r\n9. https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/lawsuit-accuses-private-prison-contractor-of-forced-labor-in-immigrant-detention/\r\n10. https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2020/03/02/11th-circuit-keeps-alive-claims-of-forced-labor-at-private-south-georgia-detention-center/\r\n11. https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2020/01/30/lawyers-trade-appellate-arguments-over-forced-labor-at-immigrant-detention-site/\r\n12. https://onlabor.org/the-use-of-forced-labor-in-private-immigration-detention-centers/\r\n13. https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2019/12/immigration-detainee-geo-forced-labor-lawsuit/\r\n14. https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/ice_detainees_may_proceed_as_a_class_in_forced_labor_lawsuit_appeals_court\r\n15. https://lawprofessors.typepad.com/immigration/2020/05/ending-forced-labor-in-ice-detention-centers-a-new-approach-georgetown-immigration-law-journal-for.html\r\n16. http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/laborimmigrationdetention.pdf\r\n17. http://inthesetimes.com/features/ice_immigrant_detention_centers_forced_prison_labor_investigation.html\r\n18. https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/immigrant-detention-contractors-can-be-liable-for-forced-labor\r\n19. https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/sd-me-detention-lawsuit-20180516-story.html\r\n20. https://www.usccr.gov/press/2018/01-02.pdf\r\n21. https://www.axios.com/private-prisons-immigrant-detention-8e5b3317-8ecf-476c-b915-25330852e66f.html\r\n22. https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/us/using-jailed-migrants-as-a-pool-of-cheap-labor.html\r\n22. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-detention/11-toothpaste-immigrants-pay-big-for-basics-at-private-ice-lock-ups-idUSKCN1PC0DJ\r\n23. https://www.thedailybeast.com/republicans-say-forced-labor-is-good-for-detained-immigrants-in-letter-defending-private-prison\r\n24. https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/13/us/senators-letter-dhs-ice-detention-work-program-invs/index.html\r\n25. https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/11/us/northwest-immigrant-detention-center-geo-group-invs/index.html\r\n\r\nIn addition to this representative sampling, the exceptional media interest in these claims has prompted the following action at the Congressional level: \r\n\r\n1. Letter from lawmakers to three Executive Branch agencies (in body of story: https://www.thedailybeast.com/republicans-say-forced-labor-is-good-for-detained-immigrants-in-letter-defending-private-prison)\r\n2. Letter from Sen. Warren: https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/senator-warren-investigates-allegations-that-private-prison-contractors-withhold-basic-necessities-use-threat-of-solitary-confinement-to-coerce-detainees-into-voluntary-work-programs\r\n3.Letter from 5 U.S. Senators: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4755454-8-13-18-Letter-to-Nielsen-Re-Conditions-and.html\r\n4.Letter from Rep. Pressley and Sen. Warren https://pressley.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-pressley-senator-warren-colleagues-investigate-revolving-door-between\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Public Confidence prong of DHS's expedited processing regulations, in addition to the sources provided above, your office should consider the following information in making its expedited processing determination: \r\n1. https://www.thedailybeast.com/private-prison-executive-at-geo-group-pursues-federal-funds-spends-at-trump-hotel\r\n2. https://www.thedailybeast.com/private-prison-bosses-beg-taxpayers-to-pay-human-trafficking-lawsuit-bills\r\n3. https://www.thedailybeast.com/ex-ice-official-paid-to-defend-dollar1-a-day-wages-for-immigrants\r\n4. https://www.thedailybeast.com/did-private-prison-contractor-illegally-boost-trump\r\n5. https://www.newsweek.com/geo-group-private-prisons-immigration-detention-trump-596505\r\n\r\nIf, as it appears from DHS-OIG's actions over the past several years, no Contractor Notifications have been received by the Department, in direct contravention of the Federal Acquisition Regulations and these private detention contracts, which amount to billions of dollars of federal tax dollars committed over a period as long as 15 years to contractors who have manifestly failed to comply with their contracts and the certification provisions of the FAR and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations relating to contractors' obligations upon receiving credible allegations of forced labor, this fact would significantly undermine the public confidence in the agency's ability to oversee these federal funds and the contractors who profit from receiving them. \r\n\r\nI therefore respectfully request Expedited Processing of this request, including a determination within 10 working days as to whether DHS-OIG will grant it.\r\n\r\nIf you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

Based on this information, I ask that you reconsider my client's expedited processing request and make a de novo determination on it within ten business days. I have also appealed today's determination administratively, which would become moot if you were to grant based on this request. See \r\n\r\nAn urgent need to inform the public exists because Congress is currently debating the FY21 Appropriations Bill, which will determine levels of future funding for contracts and contractors, as well as ICE and OIG, for civil immigration detention. \r\n\r\nA record from OIG confirming that the contractors, ICE, and OIG have violated the FAR and HSAR provisions cited is a material and directly relevant matter of consideration for House appropriators, because the ultimate penalty for violating these provisions can include voiding the contracts and permanently disbarring the contractors involved. \r\n\r\nCongress and the public have a right to know, in a time that allows for prompt and effective action, whether OIG, ICE's Contracting Officer, and these contractors have violated the terms of the contracts on which their appropriated funds are based. \r\n\r\nSeparately, the confirmation that contractors have failed to fulfill their contractual obligations with respect to the cited FAR and HSAR provisions has a direct and immediate impact on the individuals currently in ICE custody who are currently being subjected to these alleged practices by ICE's two largest detention contractors. \r\n\r\nIn sum, waiting until after Congress makes funding decisions to release this information now, when it matters, will render this information far less useful, and violate the letter and purpose of the FOIA. \r\n\r\nMany thanks, \r\n\r\nR.

According to a study by Casetext and Stanford CodeX, GPT-4 scored approximately 297 points on the UBE, which is higher than the passing threshold for all UBE jurisdictions. This score places GPT-4 in the 90th percentile of test-takers.\r\n \r\nI am a pro se litigant who is interested in using Casetext's CoCounsel to prepare and file legal documents for my case. I understand that Casetext's CoCounsel does not provide legal advice or representation, and that I am solely responsible for the accuracy and legality of my documents.\r\n \r\nHowever, I am concerned that using Casetext's CoCounsel may be considered the unlicensed practice of law under Rule 10-2.1 of the Rules Regulating The Florida Bar, which defines the practice of law as \"the giving of legal advice or legal assistance to another person\". I am also aware that Rule 10-9.1 allows the Standing Committee on Unlicensed Practice of Law to issue proposed formal advisory opinions concerning activities which may constitute the unlicensed practice of law.\r\n \r\nTherefore, I respectfully request that the Standing Committee on Unlicensed Practice of Law issue a formal advisory opinion on whether pro se use of Casetext's CoCounsel would constitute the unlicensed practice of law in Florida.\r\n \r\nThank you for your time and attention.\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nMichael Locke\r\n127 Delvalle St. \r\nMelbourne Beach, FL 32951 \r\nMbl22885@msn.com\r\n(321)506-9557\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Locke",

        "communication": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out. This email acknowledges receipt of your attached request under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140/1 et seq. (FOIA), by the Illinois Secretary of State's Office (ILSOS) on April 18, 2023.\r\n\r\nPer your request, we conducted a review of Illinois Secretary of State records for documents responsive to your request and determined there are responsive records that may be released.\r\n\r\nFirst, regarding ILSOS procedures on handling banned words, symbols, or ideals for custom license plates, the ILSOS has statutory authority to refuse the issuance of or revoke any plate configuration that may be questionable in nature as to its intent, pursuant to the below statute:\r\n\r\n(625 ILCS 5/3-405.2) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 3-405.2)\r\nSec. 3-405.2. Improper plates. The Secretary of State shall refuse to issue any license plates bearing a combination of letters or numbers, or both, which creates a potential duplication or, in the opinion of the Secretary, (1) would substantially interfere with plate identification for law enforcement purposes, (2) is misleading, or (3) creates a connotation that is offensive to good taste and decency.\r\nThe Secretary may revoke any such plates issued previously. Any person who has his or her plates revoked under this Section may acquire at no charge new plates and any required stickers of the same category and for the same period of registration.\r\n(Source: P.A. 83-449.)\r\n\r\nCitizens can submit potential offensive license plates to ILSOS for investigation via the following form found on the ILSOS website: Offensive License Plate Contact Form (ilsos.gov)<https://apps.ilsos.gov/ContactFormsWeb/offensive_plate_contact.jsp>. Following an investigation, if ILSOS finds that an issued special plate is indeed offensive, a standard letter is sent to the owner of the plate to have the plate pulled. Once the plate is pulled, ILSOS adds the offensive special plate to the ILSOS inhibit list. Attached is an example of the ILSOS letter revoking a custom plate. Please note the record contains information subject to redaction under FOIA pursuant to the following exemption:\r\n\r\nSection 7(1)(b) Private information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of the Act, a State or federal law or a court order.\r\n\r\nAlso attached is the ILSOS list of banned special license plates, known as the ILSOS inhibit list, as of 3/31/2023.\r\n\r\nFinally, please find a press release published on the ILSOS website, accessible via the following link: Secretary of State Giannoulias reveals rejected vanity plates in 2022 (ilsos.gov)<https://www.ilsos.gov/news/2023/january/230123d1.pdf>.\r\n\r\nYou have the right to have any denial of your request reviewed by the Public Access Counselor, Office of the Illinois Attorney General, 500 S. 2nd St. Springfield, Illinois, 62701, (877) 299-3642, Public.Access@ilag.gov<mailto:Public.Access@ilag.gov> (5 ILCS 140/9.5(a)). You also have the right to seek judicial review under Section 11 of the Act (5 ILCS 140/11).\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJanna Spriester | Assistant General Counsel & FOIA Officer\r\nIllinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias\r\n100 W.

Please be advised that pursuant to Section VI.C of New York City Department of Education (\u201cDOE\u201d) Chancellor\u2019s Regulation D-110 (\u201cCR D-110\u201d), additional time is needed to respond to your request. Factors to be considered under CR D-110 in determining whether there exist circumstances necessitating more time to respond to a request may include, but are not limited to, \u201c[1] the volume of a request, [2] the ease or difficulty in locating, retrieving or generating records, [3] the complexity of the request, [4] the need to review records to determine the extent to which they must be disclosed, and [5] the number of requests received by the agency.\u201d1 \r\nWith respect to factor 2, your request requires searching multiple DOE offices. With respect to factor 4, responsive records will undergo review to ensure any records or portions thereof are exempt from disclosure. With respect to factor 5, at the time you made your request several other FOIL requests were already pending, many of which involved multiple factors or all of the factors cited above. \r\nPlease note that the list of factors is not exhaustive, and that additional extenuating circumstances apply here. Currently, additional time is also needed to process your request because offices tasked with locating, retrieving and reviewing responsive records are prioritizing matters relating to COVID-19 and are therefore experiencing increased workloads. \r\nGiven the circumstances applicable to your request, a response is expected by February 28, 2022. \r\n\r\nPlease visit FOIL-2021-040-00341 to view additional information and take any necessary action.

We are writing regarding your Freedom of Information Act Request for the following records: To Whom It May Concern: \r\n\r\nPursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act., I hereby request the following records: \r\n\r\nIn the CPS Procedural Manual, it states, \"The IEP team then submits a school assignment request to ODLSS to provide the appropriate school closest to the student\u2019s residence that can implement the IEP.\" \r\n\r\nProvide records sufficient to show the following: \r\n\r\n1. A blank form/submission for the school assignment request; \r\n2. Anonymized data of all school assignment requests made on behalf of CPS students with IEPs requiring placement for the 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 (to date) school years. These records should include a unique non-identifiable code for the student, the date their IEP was finalized, the date the school assignment request was made, the date the school assignment letter was issued, and the date the student enrolled. \r\n\r\nBecause this request is in the public interest for Illinois nonprofit The FOIA Bakery\u2019s work to advocate for public education, please waive any fees in accordance with 5 ILCS \u00a7 140/6(c). Feel free to contact me with any questions, or if clarification is needed. \r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

A blank form/submission for the school assignment request; RESPONSE : Documents responsive to your request are available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. 2. Anonymized data of all school assignment requests made on behalf of CPS students with IEPs requiring placement for the 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 (to date) school years. These records should include a unique non-identifiable code for the student, the date their IEP was finalized, the date the school assignment request was made, the date the school assignment letter was issued, and the date the student enrolled. RESPONSE: Data reflecting some, but not all, of the information sought in this part of your request is available to download via the CPS FOIA Center at www.cps.edu/FOIARequests . Please log in with your username and password to access the records. The FOIA office has been advised by the CPS Office of Diverse Learners Supports and Services that it does not maintain any single system or database that comprehensively tracks each datapoint listed in this portion of your request. The raw data being provided reflects the date of assignment requests made and the date of assignments being finalized. Please note that these are original requests for the applicable school year only and do not reflect revisions nor requests made for the next school year. In order to respond to this portion of your request fully, the District would be required to first analyze individual IEP and assignment records and then cross-reference them with enrollment records in order to create a brand-new dataset. That new dataset would then have to be anonymized. Please note that the Illinois Freedom of Information Act applies only to existing records that a public body has chosen to create and maintain in the normal course of its business. It does not require the District to prepare or create records that did not exist at the time the request was made. [5 ILCS 140/1] Accordingly, the District has no further records responsive to this portion of your request. To the extent you consider this a denial of your request, pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/9.5(a) you may file a Request for Review with the Public Access Counselor (PAC) at: Public Access Counselor; Office of the Attorney General; 500 South 2nd Street; Springfield, IL 62706 . You also have the right to seek judicial review of your denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court; 5 ILCS 140/11.  Thank you for your request.

This policy is available online. Under this policy, the names of senior leaders, spokespersons, and political appointees are generally releasable. With respect to this FOIA request, DHS may have applied FOIA Exemption 6 to protect PII of DHS employees, including names and contact information. To the extent that has DHS withheld employee PII within these records, it has been determined that the employee(s) has/have substantial and legitimate privacy interests and that these interests are not outweighed by any public interest in the operations of the Department.For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).  This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.You may notice a recent date on the attached records. This is the date our processor queried the record in response to your FOIA request. For clarity, it is not the date the agency first created the record.The following item(s) also apply to your request:       \u2022\tApproximately [0] pages were withheld in their entirety.       \u2022\tFees: In the processing of this FOIA request, no fees are being assessed.       \u2022\tOther:This completes the CBP response to your request.  You may contact CBP's FOIA Public Liaison, Charlyse Hoskins, by sending an email via your SecureRelease account, mailing a letter to 90 K St, NE MS 1181, Washington DC, 20229 or by calling 202-325-0150. (If you need telecommunication relay service (TRS) assistance to communicate with the CBP FOIA Office and you are in the United States, please dial 711 to obtain TRS assistance and notify the Communications Assistant that you want to contact the CBP FOIA Office at the telephone number (202) 325-0150). The FOIA Public Liaison is able to assist in advising on the requirements for submitting a request, assist with narrowing the scope of a request, assist in reducing delays by advising the requester on the type of records to request, suggesting agency offices that may have responsive records and receive questions or concerns about the agency\u2019s FOIA process.

If you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you have a right to appeal the final disposition.

I have previously written about the government and its activities, with some reaching over 100,000 readers in outlets such as Gizmodo, MuckRock, Motherboard, Property of the People, Unicorn Riot, and The Outline, among others. As such, as I have a reasonable expectation of publication and my editorial and writing skills are well established. In addition, I discuss and comment on the files online and make them available through non-profits such as the library Internet Archive and the journalist non-profit MuckRock, disseminating them to a large audience.

Metro Police Second District (2D) created from the beginning of May 31st, 2020 to end of June 1st, 2020.\r\n\r\nAfter due consideration, your request has been granted in part and denied in part.  The names and Computer Assisted Dispatch (CAD) numbers of all involved officers and officials below the rank of Inspector, the Central Complaint Number (CCN), and other identifying information have been redacted from the two attached PD Forms 901-m under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-534(a)(2) and (a)(3)(C) to prevent the unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of these officers and officials.\r\n\r\nPlease know that under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR \u00a7 412, you have the right to appeal this response to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.  If you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal\" or \"FOIA Appeal\" in the subject line of the letter as well on the outside of the envelope.  The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request; (2) a copy of any written denial; (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and/or arguments advanced in support of disclosure; and (4) a daytime telephone number, an e-mail and/or U.S. mailing address at which you can be reached.\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be mailed to: The Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel, FOIA Appeal, 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 407, Washington, D.C.  20004.  Electronic versions of the same information can instead be e-mailed to The Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel at foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov> .Further, a copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to the Freedom of Information Officer of the involved agency, or to the agency head of that agency, if there is no designated Freedom of Information Officer there.  Failure to follow these administrative steps will result in delay in the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal to the Mayor.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience in this matter.\r\n\r\nTeresa Quon Hyden\r\nAssistant General Counsel\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nMetropolitan Police Department\r\n441 Fourth Street, NW\r\n11th Floor South\r\nWashington, DC 20001",

A copy of the 2017 Inaugural Munitions Summary and a summary of the munitions deployed on January 6, 2021 are attached.  You will note from the two documents provided that the record-keeping process has changed since the 2017 Inauguration.  Loadout and loadins are no longer conducted.  Instead, an inventory of munitions deployed are now typically conducted on a monthly basis.  Therefore, no responsive records have been located with regard to your request for a December 12, 2020 munitions loadout and loadin.\r\n\r\nPlease know that under D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-537 and 1 DCMR \u00a7 412, you have the right to appeal this response to the Mayor or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.  If you elect to appeal to the Mayor, your appeal must be in writing and contain \"Freedom of Information Act Appeal\" or \"FOIA Appeal\" in the subject line of the letter as well on the outside of the envelope.  The appeal must include (1) a copy of the original request; (2) a copy of any written denial; (3) a statement of the circumstances, reasons, and/or arguments advanced in support of disclosure; and (4) a daytime telephone number, an e-mail and/or U.S. mailing address at which you can be reached.\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be mailed to: The Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel, FOIA Appeal, 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 407, Washington, D.C.  20004.  Electronic versions of the same information can instead be e-mailed to The Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel at foia.appeals@dc.gov<mailto:foia.appeals@dc.gov> .Further, a copy of all appeal materials must be forwarded to the Freedom of Information Officer of the involved agency, or to the agency head of that agency, if there is no designated Freedom of Information Officer there.  Failure to follow these administrative steps will result in delay in the processing and commencement of a response to your appeal to the Mayor.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience in this matter.\r\n\r\nTeresa Quon Hyden\r\nAssistant General Counsel\r\nOffice of the General Counsel\r\nMetropolitan Police Department\r\n441 Fourth Street, NW\r\n11th Floor South\r\nWashington, DC 20001",

See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39.  If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected.

        "communication": "Dear Ms. McClurkin,\r\n\r\nThank you for the note. As a reporter who plans to use the public records I have requested to publish newsworthy articles of interest to the American public, I request a fee waiver for this FOIA request. Specifically, the records that I am requesting from your agency will significantly contribute to the American public's understanding of whether and how the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is protecting the endangered Florida panther's habitat in southern Florida, including its approach to private landowners who are seeking an incident take permit in Collier County, Florida. It will also shed light on which business interests and lobbyists are influencing the agency's decision making, including the agency's administration of FOIA. The Florida panther's survival, and the general implementation of the ESA, is an issue of the utmost importance, as it pertains directly to the U.S. government's commitment to mitigating the extinction crisis that threatens wildlife around the country. As such, I request all fees in this matter be waived.\r\n\r\nI have a long track record of publishing important stories of public interests on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and intend to continue doing this work with the help of the documents your agency provides. You can find an example of my work here: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/18/trump-administration-us-endangered-species-discussions-secret\r\n\r\nIf the agency denies me a fee waiver, I am willing to pay up to $50 in fees.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions, please contact me at 248-763-0088.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJimmy Tobias\r\n",

        "communication": "Good Afternoon Mr. Tobias,\r\n\r\nThanks for your response.\r\n\r\nYou have asked us to waive the fees for processing your request.  Our FOIA regulations state that bureaus will waive, or partially waive, fees if disclosure of all or part of the information is (1) In the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities, and (2) Not primarily in your commercial interest. See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7\u202f2.45(a).  Our FOIA regulations also provide four specific criteria that are used to determine whether these two requirements are met.  See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7\u202f2.48(a).  Your request meets the requirements and your fee waiver has been granted.\r\n\r\nWe use Multitrack Processing to process FOIA requests.  The Simple track is for requests that would generally take one to five workdays to process.  The Normal track is for requests that would generally take six to twenty workdays to process.  The Complex track is for requests that would generally take twenty-one to sixty workdays to process.  The Extraordinary track is for requests that would generally take more than sixty workdays to process.  The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing, which are processed as soon as practicable.  Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\r\n\r\nYour request falls into the Complex processing track.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about our response to your request, you may contact Tiffany McClurkin by email at foiar4@fws.gov<mailto:foiar4@fws.gov> or by phone at (404) 679-4104.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\nTiffany McClurkin\r\nU.S. Fish & Wildlife Service\r\nHeadquarters Information Resources & Technology Management\r\nAtlanta Regional Office\r\nFOIA Coordinator",

Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\n RCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n \r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)).

CORRECTED REQUEST IS AS FOLLOWS:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKENT SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 (2021) Request for a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the District including the District Responses for the year 2021\r\n\r\nVia email: PublicRecords@Kent.k12.wa.us\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Washington Public Records Act [RCW 42.56] I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\n1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2021 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2021.\r\n\r\nNote: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2021 can be excluded from this request.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe use of 3rd party \u201cportals\u201d (Such as GOVQA or NEXTREQUEST) for communication and production of records in response to a public records request is optional for the requestor in the State of Washington. Respectfully we decline to use any 3rd party \"portal\" system, specifically GOVQA and NEXTREQUEST. Please provide all records electronically via direct email attachment, or via no password, no registration internet cloud-based download link.\r\n\r\nPlease do not direct or invite us to use, register for, or communicate with your agency via any 3rd party portal including but not limited to FOIAOnline, GovQA, NextRequest, FOIAExpress, JustFOIA FOIADirect, WebForm, or any other commercial 3rd party records portal service.\r\n\r\nRCW 42.56.080 - Identifiable records\u2014Facilities for copying\u2014Availability of public records.\r\n\r\n\"...Agencies shall honor requests received in person during an agency's normal office hours, or by mail or email, for identifiable public records unless exempted by provisions of this chapter. No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format. Unless the records exist IN PAPER FORM ONLY, DO NOT instead create new records by printing native stored electronic files, then scanning and re-printing these newly scanned prints only to reproduce them in again in electronic production.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, please inform us of the total charges in advance of fulfilling the request in strict compliance with all provisions of the Washington State Public Records Act.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION - FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\r\n\r\nTake caution with the broad application of redaction and withholding of identified public records claiming \"global FERPA\" exemptions. When an agency claims an exemption for an entire record or portion of one, it must inform the requestor of the statutory exemption and provide a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record or portion withheld. RCW 42.17.310(4)/42.56.210(3). The brief explanation should cite the statute the agency claims grant an exemption from disclosure. The brief explanation should provide enough information for a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the claimed exemption is proper. Global, nonspecific claims of exemption such as \"FERPA\" are insufficient. One way to properly provide a brief explanation of the withheld record or redaction is for the agency to provide a withholding index. It identifies the type of record, its date and number of pages, and the author or recipient of the record (unless their identity is exempt). The withholding index should allow a requestor to make a threshold determination of whether the agency has properly invoked the exemption. There are several exceptions to the FERPA exemption and any agency silently withholding large swaths of public records citing \"FERPA!\" without providing the original identified record, properly redacted, or if withheld in its entirety, providing a record description and page count or record length, will be challenged in accordance with RCW 42.56.550 if a reasonably detailed withholding index or exemption log is not included.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION LOGS\r\n\r\nPlease ensure all redactions or exemptions claimed by your agency in the production of responsive records are accompanied by a complete and detailed exemption log noting the valid legal reason for each exemption at each redaction location in the record produced, as well as the specific number of pages if any that your agency redacts or withholds in their entirety. Each redaction should be noted by footnote or by a clear reference to the specific justification for that redaction, and only the minimal exempt portion of any record may be withheld.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PURPOSE DECLARATION\r\n\r\nThe Washington State Public Records Act prohibits the disclosure of \u201clists of individuals\u201d for a commercial purpose (RCW 42.56.070(8)). I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. We look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n",

CORRECTED REQUEST IS AS FOLLOWS:\r\n\r\nKENT SCHOOL DISTRICT \u2013 (2021) Request for a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by the District including the District Responses for the year 2021.\r\n\r\nThe district responded January 3, 2023 once we reopened after the holiday the break. However, the email sent to another mail box within your agency as we have multiple requests for the same thing just different schools years.\r\n\r\nBased on the information provided, the estimated preliminary cost is $87.50 with a 10% deposit of $8.75.\r\n\r\nThe attached form will direct you to Kent School District's online payment account system. Once you make your deposit, you will receive a receipt for the payment and the district will begin processing request. Your Public Records number is 22-23-63\r\n\r\nPer District Procedure 4040P and RCW 42.56.120, the District charges the following fees for electronic copies of records:\r\n\r\n1. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of district equipment to scan the records;\r\n\r\n2. Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;\r\n\r\n3.

Each responsive pdf, photo, spreadsheet is considered an electronic document per RCW 42.56.120.\"\r\n\r\nIndividual emails downloaded from your server are not an individual \"electronic file.\" When calculating fees your should take into account standard bundling and compression. Emails are also not downloaded per email but in batches and in other bundled formats. Your agency should not be applying fees until the individual files are prepared for transmission to the cloud.\r\n\r\nPlease provide an updated fee estimate AFTER applying fees and standard electronic file compression such as .zip or .rar (Also in regular use by your agency in the course of normal day to day operations as covers by statute).\r\n\r\nA detailed invoice would be appreciated.

Requests for Records\r\nRecords Request No. 1: All Documents constituting, reflecting, relating to or that contain current use policies if any for each type of 1033-program controlled equipment, including situations or circumstances in which use is authorized or prohibited.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 2: Records that list the dates, locations, suspected offense(s) or rationale for operation, controlled equipment deployed, arrests, and uses of force for each deployment of 1033-program controlled equipment since July 1st, 2019, specifically: firearms, armored vehicles, and night vision equipment.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 3: All records of complaints regarding the use and impact of 1033-program controlled equipment, including correspondence, visual or audio-visual materials, and responses to complaints.\r\n\r\nRecords Request No. 4: Documents that constitute, reflect, relate to or that contain rationales or criteria for acquisition of 1033-program controlled equipment, prior to its acquisition.\r\n\r\nII. Response Time\r\nPlease provide requested documents as they become available.\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this request in ten (10) days, either by providing the requested information or providing a written response setting forth the specific legal authority on which you rely in failing to disclose each requested record, or by specifying a date in the near future to respond to the request. See Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 6255. Pursuant to section 6253, please disclose all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from any portions of records you claim are exempt from disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo assist with the prompt release of responsive material, we ask that you make records available to us as you locate them, rather than waiting until all responsive records have been collected and copied.\r\n\r\nThe American Friends Service Committee seeks this information as the requestor to promote and provide public access to these documents and increase civic engagement. Because this request is made on behalf of a nonprofit public interest organization, with the intent to make this material easily accessible to the public, we request that you waive any fees. In responding to this request, please keep in mind that Article 1, \u00a7 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution expressly requires you to broadly construe all provisions that further the public\u2019s right of access, and to apply any limitations on access as narrowly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss these requests, please feel free to reach out to me, John Lindsay-Poland, co-director of the Healing Justice Program at 510-282-8983.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

The Sherriff\u2019s Office provided me with the incident number 2107220284/case number 21015344 and incident number 2301220136/case number 23001556. If you have any additional case numbers or information, let me know.\r\n\r\nFirst we have to see from the law enforcement agency if we are authorized to release the audio. If we are authorized to release it, we will have your request done as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWe are bound by Florida State Statute Section 365.171(12)(a) and 401.30 to redact certain information from 911 calls. Section 365.171(12)(a), F.S., provides that any record, recording, or information, or portions thereof, obtained by a public agency for the purpose of providing services in an emergency which reveals the name, address, or telephone number or personal information about, or information which may identify any person requesting emergency service or reporting an emergency by accessing an emergency communications E911 system is confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1), F.S.  Additionally, under 401.30, records of emergency calls which contain patient examination or treatment information are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) and may not be disclosed without the consent of the person to whom they pertain, but appropriate limited disclosure may be made without such consent to the person\u2019s guardian, to the next of kin if the person is deceased, or to a parent if the person is a minor.\r\n\r\nOnce your request is complete, we could email over an invoice. You could be charged for labor at a rate of $29.94 an hour if the request takes longer than 30 minutes to pull the audio. We will let you know if it reaches that point. As long as the audio is redacted, the audio file is small enough to be attached to an email and there isn't a labor charge we must receive payment for first, we can send it over email as soon as your request is complete, free of charge. If you prefer the audio be burnt onto a CD, the cost will be $0.30 for the CD and $1.76 for postage if mailed. We accept cash and checks.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMarisa\n",
