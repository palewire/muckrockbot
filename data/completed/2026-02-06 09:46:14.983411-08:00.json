Specifically, there is no date range provided in this request. Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency. For this reason, 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS FOIA regulations require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the DHS component or office you believe created and/or controls the record. The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.\r\n\r\nA list of DHS Component and Offices is located online to aid in providing more information: https://www.dhs.gov/operational-and-support-components. Additionally, your identified DHS Components or Offices may have their own FOIA office for FOIA request submissions. A list of DHS FOIA Offices is located online: https://www.dhs.gov/foia-contact-information. If your identified DHS Component or Office has a FOIA office, please submit directly to that office. Otherwise, respond back with your additional information.\r\n\r\nPlease resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking. This is not a denial of your request. Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request. If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.\r\n\r\nYou have a right to appeal the above determination. Should you wish to do so, you must send your appeal and a copy of this letter, within 90 days of the date of this letter, to: Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, Mail Stop 0655, Washington, D.C. 20528-0655, following the procedures outlined in the DHS FOIA regulations at 6 C.F.R. Part 5 \u00a7 5.5(e)(2). Your envelope and letter should be marked \u201cFOIA Appeal.\u201d Copies of the FOIA and DHS FOIA regulations are available at www.dhs.gov/foia.\r\n\r\nYou may contact the DHS FOIA Public Liaison at 202-343-1743 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request. You may also contact OGIS at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road-OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001, e-mail at ogis@nara.gov; telephone at 202-741-5770; toll free at 1-877-684-6448; or facsimile at 202-741-5769.\r\n\r\nYour request has been assigned reference number 2024-HQFO-01341. Please refer to this identifier in any future correspondence. If you have any questions, or would like to discuss this matter, please feel free to contact this office at 1-866-431-0486 or at 202-343-1743.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDHS FOIA, Privacy Office\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security\r\n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE\r\nMail Stop 0655\r\nWashington, DC 20528-0655\r\nE-mail: foia@hq.dhs.gov\r\nVisit our FOIA website https://www.dhs.gov/foia\"",

The supervisor is responsible for determining whether the requested assistance\r\nwould be permitted under the California Values Act (Government Code \u00a7 7284.2 et seq.).\"\r\n\r\nSpecifically,  I am requesting any document, email, or notification, in possession by the San Luis Obispo Police Department (SLOPD) received from either the US Department of Homeland Security or US Immigration and Customs Enforcement pertaining to their (ICE/DHS) activity in San Luis Obispo city and county on 12/29/2025.\r\n\r\nFurther, I am requesting any document or email from SLOPD responding to or acknowledging the aforementioned document, email, or notification from DHS/ICE  to SLOPD regarding their activity (DHS/ICE) on 12/29/2025.\r\n \r\nLastly, I am requesting the actual FEDERAL REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE to the SLOPD from DHS or any agency thereunder related to their (DHS/ICE) activity in San Luis Obispo city and county on 12/29/2025. \r\n\r\nHaving been surrounded by and detained (in the vernacular, \"jumped\") in the dark on 12/29/2025 in San Luis Obispo at 6:15am for no other reason than being impoverished and living in a rundown apartment complex with a large Hispanic population (also impoverished), by unknown masked individuals, including one one wearing a tactical vest (instead of a red coat) with a \"police\" patch on it without a badge (similar to another era's Gestapo or Stasi) and having not identified which agency's authority they were working under, I, as well as many of my entire state's impoverished Mexican-AMERICAN camarada, find these documents and their ability to turn our local, supine, prostrate, and compliant police departments, into nothing more than an extension of a hostile and insulated federal government located thousands of miles away (similar to England's relationship with America in its colonial past), to be of particular interest.

The document titled \"12.29.25 Summary Reports\" contains three Summary Reports that were created in response to DHS notifying SLOPD via phone call that DHS would be in the identified areas. These Summary Reports were created for the purpose of department awareness; SLOPD personnel did not respond to those locations or otherwise assist with DHS operations.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that every effort has been made to search for all records which may fall within the scope of your records request, and, as such, we believe our search is quite thorough.

The Department is cognizant of its responsibilities under the CPRA. It recognizes the statutory scheme was enacted to maximize citizen access to the workings of government. The CPRA does not mandate disclosure of all documents within the government\u2019s possession. Rather, by specific exemption and reference to other statutes, the CPRA recognizes that there are boundaries where the public\u2019s right to access must be balanced against such weighty considerations as the right of privacy, a right of constitutional dimension under California Constitution, Article 1, Section 1. The law also exempts from disclosure records that are privileged or confidential or otherwise exempt under either express provisions of the CPRA or pursuant to applicable federal or state law, per California Government Code Sections 7927.200; 7927.700; 7923.600-7923.625; 7927.705; and 7922.000.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Department has completed its review and is providing you with records responsive to your request.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPlease note that under Section 7920.530 of the CPRA, \u201cpublic records\u201d includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public\u2019s business and excludes writings containing or consisting of personal information unrelated to governmental activities. Similarly, Sections 7927.700 and 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest. Therefore, responsive records containing personal information are being provided to you with redactions.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please respond to this email.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLAPD Public Records &amp; Subpoena Response Section, CPRA Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************************                          \r\n<em>Questions about your request?</em> Reply to this email or sign in to contact staff at City of Los Angeles.<br><br><em>Technical support:</em> See our <a href=\"https://www.civicplus.help/nextrequest/docs/requesters\">help page</a>",

        "communication": "Dear Ms. Deborah Levi:\r\n\r\nThis is an acknowledgement of your request for public information submitted to the Document Compliance Unit (\u201cDCU\u201d) of the Baltimore Police Department (\u201cBPD\u201d). Your request is governed by the Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cPIA\u201d), Maryland Code, General Provisions Article (\u201cGP\u201d), Sections 4-101 et seq. DCU will attempt to process your request promptly. However, our response may take longer than ten (10) working days, the reasons for which may include the scope of your request, the type and volume of potentially responsive records, and the nature of the search, review, and preparation that is required. DCU will contact you with the availability of records and the possible costs associated with this request, as soon as the information is made available by the Custodian of Records. Likewise, if the DCU and/or the Custodian of Records need you to clarify your request, DCU will than contact.\r\nYour request seeks Public Integrity Bureau\u2019s (PIB) administrative disciplinary records recently made disclosable pursuant to Anton\u2019s Law, S.B. 178 (2021 Session). Although we have not yet investigated the scope of your particular request, production of these records often involves expenditure of substantial resources in the search for, preparation of, and reproduction of responsive materials.\r\nBPD will offer requestors of such records the option to receive the disciplinary history summary for each BPD member identified in the request in lieu of a comprehensive response to the request. These summaries provide an overview of all disciplinary investigations against the subject officer including the disposition of each, can be prepared more quickly than a full disciplinary file, and can be produced at little or no cost to the requestor. The summary may provide all of the information you seek, or may enable you to resubmit a more tailored request, thereby reducing the fee BPD charges to recover its costs in producing the materials you require.\r\nPlease respond to this email within 10 business days indicating whether you wish to receive disciplinary history summaries in lieu of your request as originally stated. This information is required for DCU to move forward with either 1) preparing an estimate of the cost associated with the production of the disciplinary history summary or 2) preparing an estimate of the costs associated with the production of records responsive to the full scope of your request. No further action will be taken by DCU until we receive your response. Please refer to tracking # MPIA 25-1346 in any subsequent correspondence pertaining to this matter. All follow up correspondence should be made in writing and submitted to the DCU\u2019s e-mail: DCU@baltimorepolice.org<mailto:DCU@baltimorepolice.org>.\r\n\r\n\r\nP/O Rico Calcitrai\r\nBaltimore Police Department\r\nDocument Compliance Unit\r\nLegal Affairs Division\r\n242 W. 29th Street\r\nBaltimore Maryland, 21211\r\nDCU@baltimorepolice.org<mailto:DCU@baltimorepolice.org>\r\nMPIA request forms\r\nhttp://law.baltimorecity.gov/office-legal-affairs-baltimore-police-department\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The information contained in or attached to this e-mail message may be a privileged and confidential attorney/client communication, or otherwise confidential, and is intended only for the use of the individual or entity to whom it is addressed.

Which we would not have access to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClarification is required pursuant to RCW42.56.080(1):\r\n\r\nA public records request must be for identifiable records. A request for all or substantially all records prepared, owned, used, or retained by an agency is not a valid request for identifiable records under this chapter, provided that a request for all records regarding a particular topic or containing a particular keyword or name shall not be considered a request for all of an agency's records.\r\n\r\nPlease provide the information required to identify clearly the public records that you are requesting.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the public records department requires a response within 30 days of clarification request to avoid closure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nViolet Blevins| Public Records Officer\r\n\r\nStevens County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office\r\n\r\n215 S.

Except as expressly noted below, it is the City\u2019s intent to cooperate with you in identifying any records that would be responsive to your request, and to expeditiously provide you with those records. \r\n\r\nHowever, as you may be aware, under California Law, a request for documents must reasonably describe an identifiable record, and must be focused and specific. (See Cal. Govt. Code \u00a7 7922.530(a); Rogers v. Superior Court, 19 Cal.App.4th 469, 481.) Likewise, cities are not required to create a new record in response to a request. (See Haynie v. Superior Court, 26 Cal.4th 1061, 1075.) Nevertheless, the City will use its best efforts to identify all records that may be responsive to your requests. \r\n\r\nDue to the time required to search, compile, and review potentially responsive documents, I am requesting an additional 14 days from the date of this response to complete the process. If further time is needed, I will notify you accordingly. As of now, the anticipated response date is October 13, 2025. For\u00a0questions or additional information, please reply to this email.

The three most recent communications (e.g., emails, text messages, call logs or transcripts, or otherwise) between a departmental officer or employee and a federal DHS or ICE employee. In addition, I request all records related to these communications, including, but not limited to, any records indicating that the department was made aware of the communications, discussions of their content or implications, evaluations them for compliance with departmental or other city policies, identification or acknowledgement of any potential policy violations, and any internal responses, disciplinary actions, or follow-up measures resulting from these communications. \r\n\r\n3. All records relating to incidents, if any, from January 20, 2025, to the day this request is responded to, in which an individual was taken from the department\u2019s custody directly into ICE custody. For each incident, the records request includes, but is not limited to, booking and transfer records, communications with ICE or other federal agencies, internal documentation or discussion of the transfer, and internal notes, memos, or documentation referencing communication with DHS or ICE.\r\n\r\nFor each request, I am not seeking identifying information, and I will accept anonymized or redacted data as necessary to protect identities. \r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest. I expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. \r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJoshua Dankoff \r\n\r\nJoshuadankoff@cfjj.org  \r\n\r\nDirector of Strategic Initiatives \r\n\r\nCitizens for Juvenile Justice  \r\n\r\n(submitted via MuckRock platform)",
