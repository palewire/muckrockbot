        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nThe transcript of oral briefing given to Miami-based Special Agent Thomas Errion on November 26, 1963 concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The transcript, typed by Dorothy Brooks, is referenced in the attached FBI document, which was released on March 18, 2025, pursuant to Executive Order 14176 issued by President Trump on January 23, 2025.\r\n\r\nThe form states that \"the file where the original\" is located is 134-379-Sub-A.\r\n\r\nAs the EO 14176 calls for \"full and complete\" disclosure of JFK records, I request a complete and unredacted copy of file identified as 134-379-Sub-A-113 and any other documents in the 134-379 Sub-A file that relate to JFK's assassination, including but not limited to information about Herminio Diaz, Lee Harvey Oswald, Cuban Student Directorate (DRE) and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC).\r\n\r\nHerminio Diaz Garcia died on May 29, 1966, according to the attached FBI report, so there is no grounds for withholding information about him.\r\n\r\nGiven strong public, congressional, and news media interest in the President Trump's order and the subsequent release of JFK, RFK, and MLK files, I ask for expedited treatment of this request.  As the editor of JFK Facts (jfkfacts.substack.com), an online newsletter with 20,000 subscribers, I will disseminate the results of this request immediately.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJefferson Morley",
