The program is described at https://www.regulations.doe.gov/certification-data/#q=Product_Group_s%3A*. Please release all historical records containing Brand Name, Product Group Code Description, Basic Model Number, and Individual Model Number Covered by the Basic Model produced since this program's inception.\r\n\r\n2) IDEA Project Data: Additionally, I am requesting any and all records related to the International Data Exchange on Appliance Efficiency (IDEA) project. This project, initially associated with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under the EnergyGuide labeling program, was reportedly integrated into the Department of Energy and may contain valuable historical model number data and other efficiency-related information. If possible, please provide records from both the FTC's and DOE's involvement with this project.\r\nThe program is described at the following URL: https://eta-publications.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/lbnl-184403.pdf\r\n\r\nAs the FOIA requires, please release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents. If you withhold information or records then please identify the exemption through which you do so and advise me of my options for appeal under the law.\r\n\r\nFEES AND FEE STATUS\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as I believe this request is in the public interest. As a board member at The Repair Association, a nonprofit organization, I am engaged in academic and public education efforts through my Appliance Repair Accessibility project. The information requested will significantly contribute to the public's understanding of appliance repairability and access to repair content, topics of increasing relevance in our consumer and environmentally-conscious society. This aligns with the FOIA's objectives of promoting transparency and accountability in governmental practices related to appliance standards and regulations.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, by analyzing and disseminating the findings through our website, social media, and industry news partners, we aim to educate the public about the importance of repairability and sustainability in the appliance industry. This endeavor is not for commercial use but for the broader purpose of public education and advocacy in the field of repair rights and environmental sustainability.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as per Sack v. DOD (2016), I qualify for educational institution fee status and ask that you process my request accordingly. In your response, please confirm that you will be processing my request under the educational institution fee status.\r\n\r\nIf fees are assessed then I agree to pay fees up to $30 without additional notice. In the event that there are fees exceeding $30 then please inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMatthew Zieminski",
