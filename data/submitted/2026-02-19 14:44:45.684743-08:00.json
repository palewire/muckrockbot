Records Requested\r\n\r\nI request all records, including cables, meeting logs, attendee rosters, security manifests, photographic evidence, open-source video collection or dissemination or internal briefing summaries, that discuss or list the following individuals as participants, attendees, or delegates at SPIEF 2015:\r\n\r\nJoseph Mifsud (linked to the Russian International Affairs Council).\r\n\r\nJeffrey Epstein (specifically seeking verification of his travel to St. Petersburg during the forum window).\r\n\r\nAnton Andreyev (representing Vdolg.ru or the Roscongress Foundation).\r\n\r\nDaria Timoshenkova (aka Daria Aslanova, representing Vdolg.ru or Roscongress).\r\n\r\nII. Specific Inquiry\r\n\r\nI am seeking to determine if these four individuals were present at the same forum events, specifically within the \"Young Leaders Forum,\" the \"Fintech/IT Innovation\" pavilions, or the plenary sessions organized by the Roscongress Foundation.\r\n\r\nIII. Keyword Search Parameters\r\n\r\nTo facilitate a comprehensive search of electronic records, cables, photo archives and internal databases, I request that the following keywords be used:\r\n\r\nEntities: \"Vdolg.ru\", \"Vdolg\", \"\u0412\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\", \"Roscongress\", \"SPIEF 2015\", \"Young Leaders Forum\", \"P2P lending Russia\".\r\n\r\nIndividuals (Phonetic/Aliases): \"Mifsud\", \"Jeffrey Epstein\", \"Andreyev, Anton\", \"Andreev, Anton\", \"Timoshenkova, Darya\", \"Timoshenkova, Daria\", \"Aslanova, Daria\", \"Aslanova, Darya\", \"\u0414\u0430\u0440\u044c\u044f \u0410\u0441\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430.\"\r\n\r\nTechnical/Operational: \"INN 7714808861\", \"Project Lakhta\", \"Information Operations St. Petersburg\", \"Identity Harvesting\", \"Digital Sovereignty Forum\".\r\n\r\nIII. Targeted Offices\r\n\r\nPlease search the records of the National Security Council (NSC), the Office of the National Security Advisor, and any \"Spot Reports\" or cables shared by the U.S. Embassy in Moscow (specifically the Political-Economic and Regional Security sections).\r\n\r\nNote: Of special interest is the possible convergence of Epstein, Mifsud, Andreyev and Timoshenkova in one event. \r\n\r\nAndreyev and Timoshenkova were pioneers in Russian FinTech and used their expertise to create the financial infrastructure that assisted the Kremlin's 2016 election interference efforts. The Epstein files includes several documents which detail Epstein's interest in attending the networking event and hobnobbing with young Russians in the financial sector. Here is an example: https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01191262.pdf\r\n\r\nPlain language: If Epstein was at this event, documentation of it by the U.S. government would have likely been generated. \r\n\r\nThank you to the Obama Presidential Library and for the library's commitment to transparency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Delaware",

I've attached a copy of the documents sent to our team to provide context on the fields and abbreviations in question. \n\nDocumentation explaining, for each field included in the prior production: \n\nThe full field name and plain-language definition \n\nAll possible values and their meanings \n\nCoding schemas (including numeric, alphanumeric, or system-generated codes) \n\nOffense codes and any statutory crosswalks used \n\nFacility type classifications and related codes \n\nCustody status classifications \n\nSentence type classifications \n\nParole eligibility and release date fields \n\nDemographic coding conventions (including race, ethnicity, gender, age-related fields, etc.) \n\nAny internal terminology, shorthand, abbreviations, or system labels appearing in the records \n\nAny record layout guides, database schema descriptions, report-generation manuals, internal guidance documents, or technical documentation used by staff to generate or interpret the responsive reports. \n\nThis request is limited to documentation explaining the structure, fields, and codes used in the previously produced records. I am not requesting additional individual-level case data beyond what has already been provided. \n\nIf any portion of this request is maintained by another division, unit, contractor, or agency, please forward the request as appropriate or advise me of the correct custodian. \n\nIf there are fees associated with fulfilling this request, please notify me in advance if the total cost will exceed $100. I respectfully request a waiver of fees, as this request is made on behalf of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, the information is sought in the public interest, and it is not being requested for commercial purposes. \n\nI request that the records be provided electronically in their native format (such as PDF, Excel, CSV, or other standard electronic format). If this is not feasible, please advise of the available formats. \n\nIf any portion of this request is denied, please cite the specific statutory exemption(s) relied upon and provide information regarding the applicable appeal procedures. \n\nIf clarification would assist in processing this request, I welcome the opportunity to discuss it. Thank you for your time and anticipated cooperation. \n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. \n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. \n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 7 business days, as the statute requires. \n\nSincerely, \n\nKent Hoover, a citizen of Tennessee, in coordination with Angel Carter. \n \nYour request will be forwarded to the appropriate TN DOC division(s) to locate the information you seek and to determine the volume and any costs associated with satisfying your request.

The Patrol is required to notify you that additional research time will be required to fulfill the request. This correspondence satisfies the Sunshine Law's notice requirement within the required three business day period. Section 610.023.3, RSMo. \r\n Additional Research Time is Required: \r\nThe Patrol receives thousands of open records requests each month. Our Patrol Records Division personnel are dedicated to meeting the intent of Missouri's Sunshine Law and strive to respond to each request in a timely manner. The Patrol operates in all 114 Missouri counties and the independent city of St. Louis. Accordingly, many records maintained by the agency are not centrally located within, or immediately accessible to, the Patrol's Custodian of Records in Jefferson City. Our staff must research your request and ensure that we have captured all responsive records\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 regardless of their location within the agency. The research process is time-consuming, but we will make every effort to expedite your request. Estimated Time for Completion: \r\nThe majority of our requests are fulfilled within thirty business days. Some requests require additional research time due to their scope or complexity. Our team will conduct an initial review of your request. If we estimate that the request will be fulfilled within thirty business days, we will not send an updated time estimate. However, if we estimate that the request will take longer than thirty business days, we will provide an updated time estimate that provides a detailed justification for the additional research time. Billing: \r\nAs it relates to billing, Missouri law allows the Patrol to charge fees for copies and research time. Specifically, \"[r]esearch time required for fulfilling records requests may be charged at the actual cost of research time.\" Section 610.026, RSMo. The Missouri Supreme Court recently determined that \"staff time is the time required to provide access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items\". Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884-89 (Mo. 2021) (internal quotations omitted). \r\nThe Patrol will never bill you for redaction time or any research time conducted by our legal staff. You will only be charged for copies and staff research time as permitted by Missouri law. Please let us know if you have questions related to the billing estimate. \r\nOur team will forward a bill estimate to your attention once we have calculated the permissible costs and fees. The Patrol will not provide the responsive records until receipt of payment. Section 610.026.2, RSMo. \r\nWe appreciate your patience as we review, research, and fulfill your open records request. You can monitor the progress of your request at the link below and you will receive an email when your request has been completed. If you wish to withdraw or clarify your request, or if you have questions, please call our office at (573) 526-6146, or (573) 526-6167. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nGerard G. Callahan \r\nCustodian of Records \r\n \r\nLogin Link: https://mshp.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/Login.aspx",

Since they claim ot have recently reviewed the report and associated documents, those records should be immediately available without any search.\r\n\r\nI am therefore requesting a copy of the 1996 study on VMI going private and all related records supporting it to include, without limitation, any resolutions or actions provided to the BOV with the associated actions, votes, etc. taken.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
