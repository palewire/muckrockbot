        "communication": "Dear Sai:\r\n\r\nThis email acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Your request was received on October 22, 2024, and was assigned tracking number 25-OESPIM-0148-F. You requested the following:\r\n\r\nInformation on job listings on the USAJOBS.gov website.\r\n\r\nThe FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i), requires OPM to make a determination in response to a FOIA request within 20 business days from its date of receipt. In unusual circumstances, the federal agency time limit may be extended by 10 business days as stated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B). If your request seeks numerous documents that will necessitate a wide-ranging search, including searches of multiple program offices and possible consultations with agencies that have a substantial interest in the determination of this request, OPM will invoke a 10 business-day extension for determination of your request. You have the option to narrow the scope of your request to limit the number of potentially responsive documents.\r\n\r\nProvisions of the FOIA allow OPM to recover part of the cost of complying with your request. For purposes of fee assessment, you have been categorized as a \"all other\" requester. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.103(d). In this fee category, you are responsible for search costs incurred after the first 2 free hours and for duplication costs after the first 100 pages of records are copied free. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.109(b) and (c). No fee will be assessed if the total charge for fulfilling the request will be less than $25. 5 C.F.R \u00a7 294.109(d)(1).\r\n\r\nA search will be initiated by OPM for records responsive to your request. If any responsive records are located, they will be reviewed for determination of releasability. Please be assured that a FOIA Analyst in this office will respond to your request as expeditiously as possible. We appreciate your patience as we proceed with your request.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding your request, please contact Jonathan Griffie at jonathan.griffie@opm.gov<mailto:jonathan.griffie@opm.gov>.\r\n\r\nFor additional information regarding OPM's FOIA program, please refer to the information available on our website at https://www.opm.gov/information-management/freedom-of-information-act/.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the opportunity to assist you with this matter.\r\nSincerely,\r\nFreedom of Information Act Requester Service Center\r\nOffice of the Executive Secretariat, Privacy, and Information Management\r\nU.S. Office of Personnel Management\r\nTelephone: (202) 606-3642\r\nE-mail: FOIA@opm.gov<mailto:FOIA@opm.gov>\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DB2563.4A88F040]\r\n\r\nFollow us on LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/company/opm> | Twitter<https://twitter.com/usopm> | YouTube<https://www.youtube.com/usopm>\n",
