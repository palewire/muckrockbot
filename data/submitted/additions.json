Because of this, I am ONLY requesting records that are releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Please process my request for this servicemember's OMPF and other records under the relevant provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. I am not seeking any records that would be releasable under the Privacy Act.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
