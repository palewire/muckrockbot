Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. PDF is not preferred, and seems to have issues displaying the entire fields.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly.\r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the enclosed and publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Specifically, this request aims to obtain records pertaining to activities that could be colloquially referred to as \"Cointelpro 2.0\" or any other covert programs undertaken by the agency involving surveillance, infiltration, disruption, or manipulation of individuals or groups within the United States.\r\n\r\nDocuments of interest include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Internal memoranda, directives, and communications discussing the planning, execution, and objectives of such covert operations, including any references to MK Ultra or similar programs.\r\n2. Operational plans, strategies, and guidelines governing the conduct of surveillance and intelligence-gathering activities, including any involvement or coordination with community policing initiatives.\r\n3. Records of surveillance operations, including logs, reports, and warrants obtained for monitoring targeted individuals or groups, including any watch lists or databases used for tracking.\r\n4. Intelligence reports, assessments, and analyses generated as a result of surveillance and infiltration efforts, including any assessments related to private contractors involved in intelligence activities.\r\n5. Training materials, manuals, and protocols used to educate personnel involved in covert operations, including any materials related to community alerts or coordination with neighborhood watch groups.\r\n6. Budgetary documents related to the funding and allocation of resources for covert surveillance and intelligence activities.\r\n7. Legal opinions, guidance, and interpretations concerning the legality and oversight of covert programs.\r\n8. After-action reports, evaluations, and assessments conducted to review the effectiveness and impact of covert operations.\r\n\r\nThis request also encompasses documents related to activities synonymous with or related to \"Cointelpro 2.0,\" including but not limited to covert surveillance programs, counterintelligence operations, undercover investigations, disruption programs, counterterrorism measures, covert infiltration tactics, political surveillance programs, coercive intelligence operations, and national security investigations.\r\n\r\nPlease process this request specifically for Evan L Rees, as the documents sought are requested in relation to myself.\r\n\r\nI am specifically requesting expedited processing of this request, as the information sought is of timely and significant public interest.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nEvan L Rees\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

We will keep you informed of our progress. We expect to complete processing your request on or before 40 days from the date of this acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Labor has transitioned to a new data platform and the interface of the FOIA Portal has changed.
