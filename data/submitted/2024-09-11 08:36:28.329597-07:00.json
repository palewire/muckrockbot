        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nSubject: Public Records Request for Closed Investigative and Incident Reports\r\n\r\nDear Public Records Officer,\r\n\r\nPursuant to the California Public Records Act (Government Code Section 6250 et seq.), I am requesting the following records:\r\n\r\nInvestigative and incident reports related to a 2016 burglary case involving a man named Gary Baston, whose home in Rancho Cucamonga was burglarized. The case involved the use of license plate readers (LPRs) and security camera footage to help identify and apprehend the suspects. The vehicle was identified by a round bumper sticker, and the suspects were later caught, leading to the recovery of many of Mr. Baston\u2019s stolen items.\r\n\r\nAll closed investigative reports from 2020 to the present that mention the use of LPRs in conjunction with bumper stickers. Specifically, I am requesting records that include the keywords \"bumper sticker\" and \"LPR\" or \"License Plate Reader\". I also encourage the department to consider any additional search terms that may yield responsive records based on these parameters.\r\n\r\nUnder Government Code Section 6253(b), a request is considered valid if it provides \"a reasonably focused and effective description\" of the records sought. I believe that the keywords I have suggested are sufficiently specific to allow the department to identify responsive records, as they pertain to the use of LPR technology in identifying vehicles by their bumper stickers.\r\n\r\nSince these records pertain to closed investigations, they should be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act. The California Supreme Court has consistently upheld the presumption of disclosure for records related to closed cases, except under specific, limited exemptions, none of which apply here. Additionally, as the Sheriff\u2019s Department has previously spoken publicly about the use of LPRs, the records are not protected under confidentiality for investigative techniques.\r\n\r\nPlease provide these records in electronic format if possible. If any portions of the records are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide the non-exempt portions and specify the legal basis for any redactions or withholdings.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this request. I look forward to your response within the legally mandated timeframe. If you need any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",

Metadata includes, but is not limited to: the type of alert, any rules set for the alert, the date and time of the alert, who received the alert, locations associated with the alert, and algorithmic confidence scores associated with the alert. This metadata is stored in a database so I ask that you provide it to me as a .csv, .xls, or other database filetype.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, please do not hesitate to ask. If you would like to set up a time to discuss this request over the phone, please email me at tfeathers@gizmodo.com.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you determine certain records or portions of records are exempt from disclosure, I ask that you provide a detailed explanation of the records or portions of records being withheld and the statutory exemptions under which they are being withheld.\r\n\r\nI am requesting these records as a journalist in order to write articles in the public interest about the operations of a government agency.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Kirkpatrick, Inspector General. I request the report in its entirety, considering that it was only partially declassified in 2004. The partially declassified report can be found on the CIA CREST Database: https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/cia-rdp62-01094r000400020007-6.

The Justice Department's May 2004 Guide states that an agency \"cannot limit its search to only one record system if there are others that are likely to turn up the information requested.\"\r\n\r\nI am a university professor, an archival researcher, and a published author in intelligence history and this request is made for academic research purposes.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

        "communication": "Dear FOIA Officer:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nCopies of all Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records, documents, and communications responsive to William Douglas Pawley (September 7, 1896 \u2014 January 7, 1977).  During World War II, Mr. Pawley assisted Claire Lee Chennault in founding the First American Volunteer Group, aka the Flying Tigers, an all-volunteer air force made up of former Army Air Corps, Navy, and Marine pilots. The Flying Tigers provided air support for Chinese nationalist forces in the Pacific Theater. Later, Mr. Pawley served as the United States' ambassador to Peru (July 20, 1945 - April 27, 1946) and Brazil (June 13, 1946 - March 28, 1948).\r\n\r\nMr. Pawley was the subject of FBI investigations in 1953 and 1963, the latter of which was connected to the FBI's CONBRIBE (58-5205) probe, and as such, any investigations into a former U.S. ambassador would be the subject of public interest.\r\n\r\nPrior requests have been made for these records: on January 08, 2007, the FBI opened FOIPA request number 1066475-000, for \"PAWLEY, WILLIAM D.\" Subsequently, the FBI granted a partial release of records (54 of 59 pages) in 2011, under 1066475-002. I am requesting all records previously released and any that have yet to be released.\r\n\r\nProof of death is not required as Mr. Pawley's date of birth was over 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media. My bylines, which include Unicorn Riot, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications, and I am sending this request in coordination with Muckrock, an award-winning and nationally-recognized news organization. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). As noted above, Mr. Pawley was a former U.S. ambassador, and was investigated by the FBI on at least one occasion for public corruption, during a CONBRIBE investigation. This would be considered a matter of public interest.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $100. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",

I am looking for this same data with an updated timeframe - from 03/01/24 until the date this request is processed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDhruv Mehrotra",
