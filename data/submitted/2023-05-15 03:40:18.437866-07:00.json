Pursuant to the New York State Freedom of Information Law (Public Officers Law, Article 6, Sections 84-90), it is my esteemed honor to request access to and copies of any and all documents providing aggregated reports at a school district level concerning the information requested in the Online School Assessment Survey (OSAS) for the 2018-19 academic year, as referenced in the correspondence sent by Dr. Elizabeth Rausch-Phung in September 2018.\r\n\r\nThe materials I kindly request should include, but not be limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Aggregated immunization data for all students in grades pre-kindergarten through 12 at the school district level.\r\n2. Compliance rates for each school district.\r\n3. Any available documentation or correspondence related to schools that failed to complete and submit the survey by the December 15, 2018 deadline.\r\n\r\nIn the event that any portion of this request is denied, I respectfully request an explanation for the denial, including the specific exemption(s) under the Freedom of Information Law that you believe warrant refusal. If certain records are exempt from disclosure, kindly provide access to any reasonably segregable portion of the record.\r\n\r\nShould you determine that some portions of the requested records are exempt from disclosure, I would be most grateful if you could provide me with the remainder of the records.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJackson Parker",

See https://twitter.com/aurabogado/status/1657018774791520258?s=61&t=8Zqgr1Sh-7zb12EH9VIRJQ. Hours later, the public learned of another children\u2019s death in March 2023. See https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unaccompanied-migrant-child-died-angel-eduardo-maradiaga-espinoza-us-custody-florida/. HHS referred the public to its standards in a statement aimed at explaining the services children receive. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe ORR Unaccompanied Children Program Policy Guide is a summary of ORR policies for the placement, release and care of unaccompanied children in ORR custody. The guide is for members of the public and other stakeholders[.]\u201d See https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-introduction. Section 3.3.16 of the ORR Program Policy Guide sets forth a set of mandatory actions when a child in ORR custody. See https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-3. \r\n\r\nThis policy requires the up to 12 separate notifications in the event of a child\u2019s death: \r\n\r\nA. Reporting to Local Authorities and ORR - The care provider must immediately report the death to:\r\n(1) Local law enforcement, as appropriate;\r\n(2) The care provider\u2019s State or local licensing authority;\r\n(3) Child Protective Services, as applicable; and\r\n(4) ORR via a Significant Incident Report.\r\n\r\nB. Notification and Reporting within the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\r\n(5) ORR must immediately notify the appropriate staff in ORR, ACF and HHS.\r\n\r\nC. Notifications to External Parties \r\nORR must notify the following parties within 24 hours of a child\u2019s death: \r\n(6) The unaccompanied alien child\u2019s parent, legal guardian, or next-of-kin;\r\n(7) The unaccompanied alien child\u2019s attorney of record or the care provider\u2019s local legal service provider;\r\n(8) The applicable consulate;\r\n(9) The child advocate, if applicable;\r\n(10) Congressional officials\r\n(11) The local U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Field Office Juvenile Coordinator (FOJC); and\r\n(12) The Department of Homeland Security, ICE, Enforcement and Removal Operations, Juvenile and Family Residential Management Unit (ERO/JFRMU).\r\n\r\nDescription of Records Requested\r\nRequested Records Set #1. \r\nPlease provide any of the 12 notifications itemized above based on ORR policy that occurred in each of the two publicly reported deaths of children in ORR custody during 2023. \r\nRequested Records Set #2. \r\nPlease provide any other notifications of deaths in ORR custody that were made after the current ORR Policy 3.3.16 went into effect on July 22, 2019. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

S1 Deaths In ICE Custody Emails Meta-Data (or, alternatively, the Emails themselves)\r\nA metadata list of all emails sent or received by DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas since February 2021, containing one or more of the following words or phrases: \r\n(1) \u201cDeath in custody\u201d; (2) \u201cIn-Custody Death\u201d; (3) \u201cDetainee Death\u201d; (4) \u201cInmate Death\u201d; (5) \u201cprisoner death\u201d or (6) \u201cICE Directive 11003.5\u201d. \r\nPlease provide metadata showing: date sent, sender, attachments, file size, recipients (CC & BCC), and subject line.\r\nIf the agency\u2019s position is that the existing meta-data necessary to provide this list is not a pre-existing agency record, we will instead accept each and every non-duplicative responsive email.\r\n\r\nPart B. S1 ICE Custody Death Calendar Entries \r\nA list of all calendar entries for Sec. Mayorkas since February 2022 reflecting any meeting  the Secretary or a DHS designee was invited to or attended about ICE in-custody deaths, as reflected by the time of the meeting or any text accompanying the calendar invite. \r\n\r\nPart C. S1 Names of the 9 In-Custody Deaths on His Watch Meta-Data (or, alternatively, the Emails themselves)\r\nAll emails sent or received by DHS Secretary Mayorkas since February 2, 2021, referencing any of the following 9 individuals who have passed away in or shortly after being released from ICE custody since the Secretary\u2019s confirmation: \r\n\r\n(1) Jesse Jermone Dean Jr.\tThe Bahamas\t3/21/1962\t2/5/2021\t58\tCalhoun County Jail\r\nBattle Creek, Michigan (Calhoun Co. Michigan) \r\n\r\n(2) Diego Fernando Gallego-Agudelo\tColombia\t\t3/15/2021\t45\tPort Isabel Detention Center, Los Fresnos, TX (Ahtna)\r\n\r\n(3) Elba Maria Centeno Briones\tNicaragua\t3/23/84\t8/3/2021\t37\tEl Valle Valley Detention Facility, Harlingen, TX (MTC) \r\n\r\n(4) Pablo Sanchez-Gotopo\tVenezuela \t6/3/1981\t10/1/2021\t40\tAdams County Detention Center, Natchez, Mississippi (CoreCivic) \r\n\r\n(5) Benjamin Gonzalez-Soto\tMexico\t11/24/1985\t7/8/2022\t36\tFlorence SPC, & Central AZ Correctional Complex, Florence, Arizona (CoreCivic) \r\n\r\n(6) Kesley Vial\tBrazil\t8/29/98\t8/24/2022\t23\tTorrance County Detention Center, Estancia, New Mexico (CoreCivic) \r\n\r\n(7) Melvin Calero\tNicaragua\t9/29/83\t10/13/2022\t39\tAurora ICE Processing Center, Denver, Colorado (GEO) \r\n\r\n(8) Cristian Dimitriscu\tRomania\t\t3/7/2023\t\t\tOtay Mesa Detention Center, Otay Mesa, California (CoreCivic) \r\n\r\n(9) Salvador Vargas\tMexico\t\t4/4/2023\t61 Stewart Detention Center, Lumpkin, Georgia (CoreCivic) \r\n\r\nThere appear to be no meaningful consequences for a federal contractor that allows a preventable death in ICE custody. Retraining, a contract penalty amounting to just 20% of a single month\u2019s invoice, or multiple contract penalties amounting to only $700k for two deaths, are the only measurable penalties ICE has publicly admitted to levying against contractors whose violation of their contracts take lives. ICE does not announce these penalties, or the findings supporting them, publicly. Perhaps they do not even share them with the Secretary of Homeland Security. We\u2019d like to know if he\u2019s asked. \r\n\r\nSecretary Mayorkas committed on camera to operating ICE detention facilities in a safe and humane manner. To this end, he has also committed to reviewing performance of facilities and cancelling contracts that fail to ensure humans are safe and cared for in accordance with federal requirements. Yet the facilities listed above, which are sites of repeat findings of violations, and repeat deaths, are all\r\n\r\n\r\nExpedited Processing Request\r\nPursuant to 6 CFR 5.5(e), we hereby request expedited processing of this request, and certify under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct to the best of our knowledge and understanding: \r\nDeaths in ICE custody have been the subject of widespread and exceptional media interest both historically and today. The very first in-custody ICE death listed above was found by DHS-OIG to have been preventable, and the result of medical neglect by ICE-contracted facility staff. See, https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2023-02/OIG-23-12-Feb23.pdf (\u201cOur contracted medical team reviewed the other four deaths in ICE detention in FY 2021 and found one individual was not provided timely or appropriate care by medical staff at the Calhoun County Jail in Battle Creek, Michigan.\u201d). Despite the OIG\u2019s findings that Calhoun County and its medical contractor, the now-bankrupt Corizon (see https://www.alreporter.com/2023/02/17/corizon-prison-healthcare-provider-declares-bankruptcy-yescare-apparently-replaces-ceo/), failed to render timely or appropriate medical care to Jessie Dean before his death, ICE continues to contract with the County for the imprisonment of non-citizens, further endangering the lives of people locked inside. \r\n\r\nAs ICE is about to rapidly expand its average daily population with the end of Title 42, our community is deeply concerned that DHS is unprepared to care for those it locks up. Expedited access to these records will help dispel or confirm these concerns, and position our network to take the appropriate actions necessary to prevent preventable deaths where the government refuses to do so. \r\n\r\n#DetentionKills Transparency Initiative \r\nAl Otro Lado\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAndrew Free",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information Act Officer\r\nTransportation Security Administration\r\n601 South 12th Street\r\nArlington, VA 20598\r\n\r\nDear FOIA Officer,\r\n\r\nI am writing to submit a limited Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking records related to two areas of interest within the Transportation Security Administration (TSA): personnel records of TSA employees and records related to the TSA's use of body scanners and other advanced imaging technologies for the period of the last two years (2021-2023).\r\n\r\nFirstly, I request any and all training programs and materials provided to TSA agents in the last two years, including any materials related to cultural competency or implicit bias training. Additionally, I would like to obtain any disciplinary actions taken against TSA agents, including any records related to employee misconduct, violations of TSA policies and procedures, or complaints filed against TSA agents. Lastly, I request internal investigations of TSA employees in the last two years, including any records related to allegations of abuse, harassment, or discrimination by TSA agents.\r\n\r\nThese records will help to provide transparency and accountability for the TSA's actions in maintaining high standards of conduct among its personnel. In support of this request, I would like to cite several court cases, including EPIC v. DHS, 615 F.3d 519 (D.C. Cir. 2010), where the court held that the TSA must release documents related to the effectiveness and privacy impact of body scanners used at airports. The court found that the public interest in transparency and accountability outweighed any privacy concerns related to the release of these records. Additionally, in NARA v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), the Supreme Court held that FOIA requires the disclosure of records that could reasonably be interpreted as indicating an agency's ability or willingness to protect the privacy of individuals.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I request any training materials and manuals provided to TSA agents on the use of body scanners and other advanced imaging technologies in the last two years. Furthermore, I request technical specifications for the scanners and technologies used by TSA agents. Additionally, I would like to obtain any reports or studies conducted by the TSA or other organizations related to the effectiveness and safety of these technologies in the last two years. Lastly, I request any records related to complaints or incidents related to the use of these technologies in the last two years, including any reports of malfunctions, false positives, or privacy concerns.\r\n\r\nThese records will help to ensure the effective and safe use of advanced imaging technologies and provide insights into any privacy concerns associated with their use. In support of this request, I would like to cite the case of Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), where the court held that the Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures and that a warrant is required to conduct a search, absent some exception.\r\n\r\nFOIA requires agencies to disclose records unless they are exempt from disclosure under one of nine exemptions listed in the statute. If you determine that any of the requested records are exempt from disclosure, I request that you provide a written explanation of the exemption and the specific reasons why it applies.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJordan Lassiter",

        "communication": "Good day,TSA cannot process a request for \u201call records\u201d on an individual or for \u201call communications\u201d between TSA and a third party. You should include a date limitation, a particular topic, and if asking for correspondence, the relevant parties\u2019 names and offices or airports, if known. You can contact the TSA FOIA Branch for assistance in writing a FOIA request. This will ensure we understand which materials you are seeking and help us respond to your request quickly. Given the variety of programs at TSA and the multiple ways you might have a connection with TSA, we require this additional information about records you are seeking. As TSA operates at over 450 airports and screens on average more than 1.9 million passengers a day, it would be unduly burdensome to conduct a search at over 450 airports and TSA program offices using limited information. Please narrow or otherwise clarify your request by providing specific criteria regarding the records that you are seeking (e.g., time period, airport or other association with TSA, including employment) so that TSA can conduct a reasonable search.Please see attached.Sincerely,TSA FOIA Branch \nThis message (including any attachments) contains confidential information intended for a specific individual and purpose, and is protected by law.

My request can be divided into two distinct sections: TSA personnel records and records related to the use of body scanners and other advanced imaging technologies. Additionally, I request information pertaining to TSA activities at airports in the state of New York, including John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), Albany International Airport (ALB), White Plains Westchester County Airport (HPN), and Stewart International Airport (SWF).\r\n\r\nSection 1: TSA Personnel Records\r\nI request the following personnel records related to TSA employees:\r\n\r\nEmployment contracts, including terms and conditions of employment.\r\nPerformance evaluations and appraisals.\r\nDisciplinary actions, including warnings, suspensions, and terminations.\r\nPromotion and demotion records.\r\nRecords related to employee grievances or complaints.\r\nFurthermore, I request the following training-related records:\r\n\r\nTraining materials, manuals, and guidelines provided to TSA agents, specifically focusing on topics such as cultural competency, implicit bias, and customer service training.\r\nSection 2: Use of Body Scanners and Advanced Imaging Technologies\r\nI request the following records related to the use of body scanners and other advanced imaging technologies:\r\n\r\nTraining materials and manuals provided to TSA agents regarding the use of body scanners and advanced imaging technologies.\r\nTechnical specifications for the scanners and technologies used by TSA agents.\r\nReports or studies conducted by the TSA or other organizations concerning the effectiveness and safety of these technologies.\r\nRecords related to complaints or incidents associated with the use of these technologies, including reports of malfunctions, false positives, privacy concerns, or other relevant issues.\r\nTo ensure the accuracy and relevance of the records requested, I would like to emphasize my interest in records specifically related to TSA activities at the following airports in the state of New York: John F.
