Mr. Park was a leftist academic. He was involved in the founding of RADACADS (short for \"RADical ACADemics\") at Harvard University and in the Maoist International Movement. He co-edited the opinion page of the Michigan Daily while earning his doctorate at the University of Michigan. He sometimes used the pseudonyms \u201cMC3\u201d or \u201cMIM3\u201d. He was born in October 1962, although I am not sure of the date or place of his birth. He died on 17 May 2011. At the time of his death, he lived in Somerville, Massachusetts. He had previously lived in Hopewell Junction, New York. Proof of Mr. Park's death is attached.\r\n\r\nCROSS-REFERENCE SEARCH\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a cross-reference search of your files on the following people and organizations to see if they contain additional records related to Mr. Gray:\r\n\r\n(1) RADACADS (the \"RADical ACADemics\" group at Harvard)\r\n(2) Maoist International Movement",

Information in regards to the former testing times and usage circumstances would be much appreciated as well.\r\n\r\nI also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, and is not made for commercial usage.\r\n\r\nI expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoseph Pasteris",

I request that these records be provided in a machine-readable format, such as an Excel spreadsheet or CSV file, wherever possible.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this request, the records I seek include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n1. Official notices of banishment or barring orders.\r\n2. Internal documentation or correspondences related to these individuals and their prohibited status.\r\n3. Any lists, databases, or compilations that maintain records of these individuals.\r\n\r\nShould any portion of the requested records be deemed exempt from disclosure, I request the release of any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). If an entire document is exempt, I request a justification, citing specific FOIA exemptions, and provision of an exemption log as per Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\r\n\r\nPlease note your obligation under the law not to destroy any records potentially responsive to this request. Any withholding, redaction, or destruction of responsive records without proper justification constitutes a violation of the FOIA and is subject to litigation, as confirmed in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 (1980).\r\n\r\nEnclosed is a letter requesting a fee waiver for the processing of this request. As an independent investigative journalist associated with TransparencyReport.pw, I believe that the information I seek is in the public interest and its disclosure contributes significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.\r\n\r\nIf the enclosed waiver is not accepted and there are any potential charges in excess of $200 associated with fulfilling my request, please inform me in advance.\r\n\r\nAs stipulated by the FOIA, I look forward to your response within twenty business days (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i)).\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\nIndependent Investigative Journalist\r\nTransparencyReport.pw\r\nEmail: Jordan@Lassiter.eu\r\nPhone: +1 845-218-0299\r\n\r\nEnclosure: Fee Waiver Request Letter\r\n\r\nPlease be aware: All communications related to this request, including incoming and outgoing communications, will be publicly available on MuckRock.com.

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this correspondence as a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. subsection 552. I am requesting the following:\r\n\r\nAll publicly releasable military and civilian records for Louis Jolyon West (October 6, 1924 \u2013 January 2, 1999). Mr. West's social security number was  395-16-2395. He served in the United States Air Force (USAF) between approximately 1948 and 1956, and worked as a civilian contractor at the 3700th USAF Hospital at the Lackland Air Force Base after that. Therefore, I am requesting the following information from Mr. West's Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) and his Official Personnel Folder (OPF). This information includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Name\r\n\r\n\u2022 Service Number\r\n\r\n\u2022 Certificate of Release/Discharge Papers, aka DD form 214\r\n\r\n\u2022 Dates of Service\r\n\r\n\u2022 Branch of Service\r\n\r\n\u2022 Final Duty Status\r\n\r\n\u2022 Final Rank\r\n\r\n\u2022 Salary\r\n\r\n\u2022 Assignments and Geographical Locations\r\n\r\n\u2022 Source of Commission\r\n\r\n\u2022 Military Education Level\r\n\r\n\u2022 Awards and decorations\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian positions\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian titles\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian salaries\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian grades\r\n\r\n\u2022 Civilian job locations\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed and/or transferred, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating to, mentioning or describing said transfer or destruction, to include but not be limited to confirmation that the National Personnel Records Center has no other copies of said records.\r\n\r\nYou will find as an attachment a copy of Mr. West's obituary from the The New York Times, published on January 9, 1999.\r\n\r\nI am asking you waive any fees associated with this request. I am a member of the news media and request classification as such. My bylines, which include Creem Magazine, Covert Action Magazine, and the Geopolitical Economy Report, can be found in both print and electronic publications. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.\r\n\r\nA fee waiver is appropriate in situations where \"disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(iii). Mr. West, per the attached obituary, was a figure of considerable public interest. He worked for the government, both during his time in the USAF and as a civilian contractor, during the Korean War, on research related to the alleged brainwashing of American prisoners-of-war, by Korean, Soviet, and Chinese officials. Mr. West's OMPF and OPF would help provide the public with a better understanding of military and civilian-guided research on this subject during the Korean War.\r\n\r\nThis request is not being made for commercial purposes. All documents will be provided to the general public without charge.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I am willing to pay up to $250. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 20 working days, as the statute requires. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.\r\n\r\nIf you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nRobert Skvarla, Jr.",
