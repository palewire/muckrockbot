All application materials submitted by Immigration Judge Abby Meyer in connection with her appointment as a U.S. immigration judge, including cover letters, resumes, and any documents addressing quality ranking factors.\r\n\r\n2. A redacted copy of all remands for Immigration Judge Abby Meyer ordered by the Board of Immigration Appeals\r\n\r\n3. Copies of all judicial complaints filed with Office of IJ Conduct and Professionalism of the Executive Office for Immigration Review concerning Immigration Judge Abby Meyer.\r\n\r\nPlease search all locations and systems likely to have responsive records, regardless of format, medium, or physical characteristics.\r\nOur request for records includes any attachments to those records or other materials enclosed with those records when they were previously transmitted. To the extent that an email is responsive to our request, our request includes all prior messages sent or received in that email chain, as well as any attachments to the email. \r\n\r\nPlease search all relevant records or systems containing records regarding agency business. Do not exclude records regarding agency business contained in files, email accounts, or devices in the personal custody of your officials, such as personal email accounts or text messages. Records of official business conducted using unofficial systems or stored outside of official files are subject to the Federal Records Act and FOIA.\r\n\r\n It is not adequate to rely on policies and procedures that require officials to move such information to official systems within a certain period of time; I retain my right to records contained in those files even if the material has not yet been moved to official systems or if officials have, by intent or through negligence, failed to meet their obligations.\r\n\r\nPlease use all tools available to your agency to conduct a complete and efficient search for potentially responsive records. Agencies are subject to governmentwide requirements to manage agency information electronically,1and many agencies have adopted the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Capstone program, or similar policies. These systems provide options for searching emails and other electronic records in a manner that is reasonably likely to be more complete than just searching individual custodian files. For example, a custodian may have deleted a responsive email from his or her email program, but your agency\u2019s archiving tools may capture that email under Capstone. At the same time, custodian searches are still necessary; agencies may not have direct access to files stored in .PST files, outside of network drives, in paper format, or in personal email accounts.\r\n\r\nIn the event some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions of the requested records. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically why it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHassan Ahmad",
