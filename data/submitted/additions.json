Alejandro Luis once served as the Chief of Staff to General Artemio Palomino Toledo as noted in a declassified Military Intelligence Summary (Volume VIII, Latin America) published by the DIA in 1986. In April 1992, Alejandro Luis's son, Alejandro Antunez de Mayolo, was assassinated by the shining path in an attempt to assassinate Alejandro: https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-04-10-mn-194-story.html. Given that Alejandro Luis Antunez de Mayolo passed away on January 9, 2024 (attached is a photo of the announcement that was printed in El Comercio), releasing this information should not have any personal impact on Alejandro Luis or Alejandro.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlonso ADM",
