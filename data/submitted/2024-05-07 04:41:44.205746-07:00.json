The article also notes that Army Reserve's 1st Mission Support Command supported training and that Col. Carlos Caceres, commander of the 1st Mission Support Command, \"brought in all his local contacts with the state police, Army Reserve, National Guard, FBI. He invited whoever was out there to come meet with us to discuss our event.\u201d The article says \"approximately 200 personnel participated.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request the following records:\r\n\r\n1) All instructional materials, presentations and presentation materials related to and used during Vigilant Defender 23. This includes A) any notes taken during meetings that discussed Vigilant Defender 23, B) any notes taken during meetings that took place during Vigilant Defender 23 training, and C) any other documents related to Vigilant Defender 23, including internal documentation, public relations materials, and executive summaries.\r\n\r\n2) Any messages, emails, and associated attachments shared with local, state, and federal agencies to promote \"situational awareness\" of the Vigilant Defender 23 military training and the presence of counterintelligence agents in Puerto Rico.

From address\r\n2. To address\r\n3. bcc addresses\r\n4. cc addresses\r\n5. Time\r\n6. Date\r\n7. Subject\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. This is intended to lessen the burden as expressed by your city attorney. I am more than happy to provide documentation or tips for extracting this information from your mail server if needed. Google's Vault tooling should make this request straightforward to complete. E-mail metadata is trivially exportable from the IT infrastructure of any modern e-mail archiving or data retention system - such as Microsoft Outlook 365, Google, Datacove, etc. - and should be deliverable in a .CSV, .XLS, or other machine readable format. \r\n\r\nPlease save yourself the step of transforming the CSV into a PDF for submittal. It will save effort and ultimately save taxpayer funds.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I am not requesting the contents of each email. E-mail metadata does not include the contents of the specified e-mails, thus do not need individual review for redaction.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. If possible, I would request a waiver of all fees for searching or copying these records in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public\u2019s understanding.\r\n\r\n1. When filing this, please note which documents have already been paid for by another FOIA request, and I request that if those documents have already been screened, that they not be duplicated in cost.\r\n2. When estimating cost of per page, please use the discretion allowed by the CORA statute to interpret the pages to be 11x17, multiple columns, and 4 point font. Since this is an electronic request, the print version should not be provided, but for purposes of cost estimation, please take into consideration that Cortez population is underprivileged, and extend the courtesy of pricing accordingly. Saving the step of transforming the CSV to PDF saves the City of Cortez time, saving the taxpayers of Cortez money. \r\n2a. The economic information for this judgment comes from the submission done by myself of Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship for Montezuma County in comparison to many surrounding counties in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado. As seen in page 8 of the publicly presented documents August 22, 2023, Montezuma County has compensation ranking at 39.27% within the Kaufmann Entrepreneurial Jobs Indicators, meaning that the policy taken by Cortez brings it into direct conflict with the interests of the people they impact should they price these or other electronic documents at a punitive rate.\r\n2b. Because these documents are of the public interest, and the population is demonstrably disadvantaged, the policies of Cortez which require hundreds or thousands of dollars to achieve transparency could be construed poorly in civil proceedings, meaning that legal fees could ensue which would further penalize City of Cortez budgets. This is not my intent, therefore I state it up front that the best course of action would be to ensure that FOIA costs are not borne as specified.\r\n3. Staff time to review these documents should reflect the actual costs, not the maximum costs allowed by CORA law, please recalculate these costs taking into consideration both the public interest as well as eliminating from your cost estimate any documents previously screened by staff.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCharles Jeter\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Please do not reply to this e-mail. ***\r\nThank you for submitting your open records request under the Public Information Act (PIA) to the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC). Your request has been forwarded to the PUC\u2019s Public Information Coordinator. The Public Information Coordinator will address PIA requests in the order they are received, but in all cases within the time prescribed by law.\r\nTime To Respond\r\nWe will promptly respond to your request by providing the requested information, informing you there is no responsive information, or notifying you all or a portion of the requested information falls under an exception to public disclosure and requires a ruling from the Office of the Attorney General (OAG). If the requested information does not fall under an exception to public disclosure but will take longer than 10 business days to produce, we will notify you of the date and time the information will be provided.\r\nRequest for Clarification\r\nYou can help us respond more quickly to your request by ensuring that your request is clear, specific, and requests only the information you wish to receive. We do our best to relate requests to the information we have and do not require records to be requested by their specific names, but if you know the specific name of the record you are requesting, it will help us respond more efficiently.\r\nIf your request is vague or overly broad, we may, in compliance with Texas Government Code \u00a7 552.222, request clarification in order to ensure we understand what information you are requesting.  Also, please keep in mind that we are not required under the PIA to create new information, do legal research, or answer questions.  See Open Records Decision Nos. 555 and 563 at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/open-government/open-records-decisions.\r\nWithholding Information\r\nAlthough the PIA makes most government information available to the public, some exceptions exist. If we believe an exception applies, we will notify you that the information cannot be released and request a ruling from the OAG.\r\nCosts\r\nYou may be charged for costs associated with responding to your request.  Personnel time is charged at $15 per hour, plus 20% of the personnel charge for overhead. There is also a charge of $0.10 per page, plus personnel time, if the request exceeds fifty pages, plus postage. These rates are set by the OAG.  You can find more information regarding costs associated with PIA requests here: https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=4&ti=1&pt=3&ch=70&rl=Y.\r\nFor more information regarding access to public information held by the PUC, please visit our website at https://www.puc.texas.gov/agency/about/contact/PIA.aspx.\r\n\r\nYou may also find more detailed information regarding the PIA in Texas Government Code Chapter 552 or on the OAG\u2019s website at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/open-government/members-public.\n",

        "communication": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nAll Bureau records that might exist that mention or pertain to my grandfather Jack Hoover Aldrich (born 8-17-1920 - died 4-1-2014). Attached is his obituary. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/127474305/jack-hoover-aldrich\r\n\r\nMy grandfather worked for American Car and Foundry (ACF Industries) in the state of New Mexico in the 1950s. According to my mother's recollection, my grandfather had to undergo a federal background check as his employment involved the transport of nuclear weapon materials by train car by the ACF corporation. My mother recalls federal law enforcement interviewing neighbors and friends in 1956, and then periodic checks afterwards. My grandfather also made repeated trips to the Philippines, where he met Imelda Marcos and other officials in the Philippine government. I am curious as to whether the bureau maintained a file on my grandfather. \r\n\r\nThis request is for any and all records about my grandfather Jack Hoover Aldrich from any and all FBI offices, including HQ, field offices, legal attaches, and facilities that maintain records under the FBI\u2019s control. Please conduct a search for any records on Aldrich held by the Albuquerque Field Office. According to a blog post I just read, it is important that I state the following: \"As you know, your agency is required to search the records stored at NARA\u2019s Washington Records Center in Suitland, MD, but still technically under your agency\u2019s control. For more information see 36 CFR 1250.8\" Please also conduct a physical search of records at NARA's Washington Records Center in Suitland, for any records or documents related to Aldrich.\r\n\r\nPlease include all potentially responsive materials, including but not limited to all communications, reports, inquiries, investigations, photographs, audio files, video files, memos, directives, etc. Please include all materials found in other subject files and all materials associated with any potentially-related names and any other known aliases, nicknames, code names, or any other identifying pseudonyms or references utilized by this agency. Please consult the Central Records System and records, the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Data Management System and records, Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) records, Physical Surveillance (FISUR) records, Technical Surveillance (TESUR) records, and all available cross-reference indices, databases, and records, in addition to any other locations containing potentially-responsive materials related to Jack Hoover Aldrich.\r\n\r\nPlease include a search of any records or documents understood to be, or colloquially referred to as \"COINTELPRO records\" under the bureau's custody that could be construed as responsive to a request for records related to Jack Hoover Aldrich.\r\n\r\nIf the bureau cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or if certain portions must be redacted, please provide any reasonable segregable portion of a requested record after removing or redacting those portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exemption(s) claimed.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.
