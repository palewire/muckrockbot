However, Florida appears to be leading the way with cases continuing to pour in. Florida's family court judges across the entire state have been ordering the physical and sexual abuse of hundreds of children by way of \"show trials\" with the assistance of other state funded actors such as law enforcement, state attorneys, DCF caseworkers, child therapists, Guardian Ad Litems, and children's advocacy centers cohesively working together to silence abused victims for profit. \r\n\r\nWe have discovered government entities committing perjury and falsifying documents to intentionally conceal records of child abuse. Collectively, all are committing treason and thereby silencing abused children and victims of domestic violence. \"Me Too Moms\" has identified a very clear pattern within the family courts targeting victims of domestic violence (primarily mothers, since Domestic Violence is largely a gendered crime) and their children. \r\n\r\nVictims of domestic violence are already at a massive financial disadvantage in the Florida courts as legal aid is almost non-existent and most mothers are forced to proceed pro se against their abuser's counsel. Family court judges, which already operate under a veil of secrecy without a jury, cameras, or the general public holding them accountable, are depriving victims the right to free speech, due process, ability to present evidence and/or witnesses, verbally attacking DV victims relentlessly without evidence to do so, violating judicial canons, their oaths, and dismissing child abuse evidence. Judges are also allowing \"parental alienation\"- dubbed as \"junk science\",  coined by a known pedophile, Richard Gardner, to be used as a pedophile's defense in the courtrooms allowing more children to be sexually abused and injunctions to be wrongly dismissed.\r\n\r\nMothers across the state that are victims of domestic violence have been plunged into economic poverty and homelessness trying to save the life of their child because the state of Florida chooses to protect child abusers and pedophiles...over victims. Our children are self-harming, suicidal, unregulated from living in an abused environment, struggling with behavior issues, being strangled, drowned, choked, sexually molested, neglected, and ultimately being called liars by Florida's DCF caseworkers-even despite audio/video evidence of abuse!\r\n\r\nWe are requesting a meeting with the governor as to why he is \u201ctoo busy\u201d to meet with hundreds of mothers across the state whose children have had incidents of attempted homicide per FL Statute 784.041 & experienced Child Abuse per FL statute 39-and are ignored by all levels of government.\r\n\r\nWe are demanding answers, accountability, and an EMERGENCY order to protect abused children and victims of domestic violence immediately. We will continue to publicly point out the abuse of power occurring within every state entity until our children receive justice and freedom from CHILD PHYSICAL & SEXUAL ABUSE!\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nMe Too Moms Florida\r\nMeTooMomsFlorida22@proton.me \r\nwww.metoomoms.org\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear Mr. Welsh: \r\nOn November 29, 2022 , the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) office received your FOIA request dated November 29, 2022, and assigned it control number DOI-USGS-2023-001105 . \u00a0Please cite this number in any future communications with our office regarding your request. \u00a0You request the following information: \r\nAll aerial photographs taken during flights to monitor the November 2022 Mauna Loa eruption.\u00a0 All photos from all flights to Mauna Loa since the first mission to monitor the eruption. \r\nThe agency posted this Tweet showing it had conducted such flights: https://twitter.com/USGSVolcanoes/status/1597469642880172032?t=CfeLArczyIaPuZT46x-j4A&s=19 (https://twitter.com/USGSVolcanoes/status/1597469642880172032?t=CfeLArczyIaPuZT46x-j4A&s=19) \r\nWe have classified you as a representative of the \u201cnews media\u201d requester.\u00a0 As such, we may charge you for some of our duplication costs, but we will not charge you for our search or review costs; you also are entitled to up to 100 pages of photocopies (or an equivalent volume) for free. See .\u00a0 If, after taking into consideration your fee category entitlements, our processing costs are less than $50.00, we will not bill you because the cost of collection would be greater than the fee collected. (http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=0fc3ab3499768eebc2e3691c8cf88dec&rgn=div5&view=text&node=43:1.1.1.1.2&idno=43#43:1.1.1.1.2.7.5.3) 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.39 See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.49(a)(1) .\u00a0 You can expect to hear from us promptly regarding the outcome of this search. \r\nYou have agreed to pay up to $200.00 for the processing of your request. \u00a0If we find that this will not cover the cost of processing your request, we will stop processing your request at the point this amount has been reached and will let you know before we incur additional charges. \u00a0You can then either agree to pay the additional amount needed or narrow the scope of your request. \r\nWe use Multitrack Processing to process FOIA requests. \u00a0The Simple track is for requests that would generally take one to five workdays to process. \u00a0The Normal track is for requests that would generally take six to twenty workdays to process. \u00a0The Complex track is for requests that would generally take twenty-one to sixty workdays to process. \u00a0The Extraordinary track is for requests that would generally take more than sixty workdays to process. \u00a0The Expedited track is for requests that have been granted expedited processing, which are processed as soon as practicable. \u00a0Within each track, requests are usually processed on a first-in, first-out basis. \r\nYour request falls into the Normal processing track. \u00a0There are 9 requests pending ahead of yours in our overall processing queue. \u00a0Presuming that our current FOIA capacity and burden remain constant, we expect that we will dispatch a determination to you by December 30, 2022. \r\nYou may narrow the scope of your request to obtain quicker processing in your currently-assigned track or move the request into a different track, which may enable us to process it more quickly by communicating with us at foia@usgs.gov . \r\nThe 2007 FOIA amendments created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. \u00a0Using OGIS services does not affect your right to pursue litigation. \u00a0You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways: \r\nOffice of Government Information Services \r\nNational Archives and Records Administration \r\n8601 Adelphi Road - OGIS \r\nCollege Park, MD\u00a0 20740-6001 \r\nTelephone: \u00a0(202) 741-5770 \r\nFax: \u00a0(202) 741-5769 \r\nToll-free: \u00a01 (877) 684-6448 \r\nE-mail:\u00a0 ogis@nara.gov \r\nWeb: https://www.archives.gov/ogis (https://www.archives.gov/ogis) \r\nPlease note that using OGIS services does not affect the timing of an appeal with the Department\u2019s FOIA & Privacy Act Appeals Officer. Contact information for the Department\u2019s FOIA Public Liaison, who you may also seek dispute resolution services from, is available at https://www.doi.gov/foia/foiacenters. \r\nIf you have any questions about your request, you may contact me by email at foia@usgs.gov. \r\nSincerely, \r\nEric J.
