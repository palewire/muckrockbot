Please include both full-time and part-time officers. Please provide records sufficient to show the following information for each officer:\r\n\r\n- Name\r\n- Age or year of birth\r\n- Gender\r\n- Race or ethnicity\r\n-Rank\r\n- Job title\r\n- Callsign or other identifying number\r\n- Barracks\r\n- Unit or team assignments), if applicable\r\n- Start date\r\n- FY2022 salary\r\n- FY2022 overtime pay\r\n\r\nPlease find attached records responsive to this request. Please be aware that salary and overtime information are available at State of Vermont Employee Salaries | Open Data | State of Vermont<https://data.vermont.gov/Government/State-of-Vermont-Employee-Salaries/jgqy-2smf>; Total Compensation and Expenses FY2020 - 2023 | Open Data | State of Vermont<https://data.vermont.gov/Government/Total-Compensation-and-Expenses-FY2020-2023/2is8-zt8g/data_preview>. You may search for any Vermont state employee by both name and job title/rank.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the records supplied here are redacted in accordance with the Vermont Public Records Act exemptions found at 1 V.S.A. \u00a7 317(c)(1), related to \"[r]ecords that by law are designated confidential or by a similar term\"; 1 V.S.A. \u00a7 317(c)(7), related to \"[p]ersonal documents relating to an individual.\"\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the Department of Public Safety (\"DPS\") redacted the record to remove information exempt from public inspection and copying under the following exemptions:\r\n\r\n1 V.S.A. \u00a7 317(c)(1) (Records that by law are designated confidential or by a similar term), this includes information related to individual officer's age, race/ethnicity, and gender;\r\n\r\n1 V.S.A. \u00a7 317(c)(7) (personally identifying information, including date of birth, address, telephone number, Social Security number, name of employer, and information which could \"reveal intimate details of a person's life, including any information that might subject the person to embarrassment, harassment, disgrace, or loss of employment or friends.\"  See Rutland Herald v. City of Rutland, 2012 VT 26, \u00b6 39, 191 Vt. 387, 404, 48 A.3d 568, 579 (quoting Kade v. Smith, 2006 VT 44, \u00b6 8, 180 Vt. 554, 557, 904 A.2d 1080, 1084)), this includes information related to car numbers assigned to specific officers, as such information could allow a person to determine an officer's personal address.\r\n\r\nFurther, DPS has removed information related to the Trooper's employee and position numbers as these the portions of the record are beyond the scope of your request.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, please be aware that the records showing special teams assignments are the most current records available for those assignments. The membership composition of some teams may be different than portrayed in these records.\r\n\r\nFinally, please be aware that the record labeled \"Master List\" reflects those Troopers currently employed by the Vermont State Department of Public Safety. You may cross-reference this list with the other materials to determine the current employment status of any listed Trooper.\r\n\r\nIf you believe that a portion of the attached record has been withheld in error, or if you would like to discuss the redactions in the released record, please feel free to contact me at this email address.  Please be advised that you may also file an appeal.  If you choose to file an appeal we request that you do so in writing to:\r\n\nCommissioner Jennifer Morrison\r\nDepartment of Public Safety\r\n45 State Drive\r\nWaterbury, VT 05671\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n\r\nSam Weaver\r\nPublic Records Act Specialist\r\nVermont Department of Public Safety",

Code Ann. * 149.43)\r\nDear Butler County Records Center,\r\nI am writing to appeal the response to my public records request dated\r\nJanuary 10th, 2024, concerning the property located at 9172 W Meadow Dr,\r\nWest Chester, OH 45069. While I appreciate the documents provided so\r\nfar, it has come to my attention that the response is incomplete as it\r\nlacks the detailed tax assessment records requested.\r\nAs stated in my original request, the tax assessment records for the\r\npast five years are crucial for understanding the valuation and taxation\r\nprocesses applied to this property. This information is not only of\r\npublic interest but also necessary for ensuring transparency and\r\naccountability in property ownership and management.\r\nPer Ohio Rev. Code Ann. * 149.43, public agencies are obligated to\r\nprovide all existing public records in response to a request. In light\r\nof this, I kindly ask for a reevaluation of my request and the provision\r\nof the following missing records:\r\nTax Assessment Records: Detailed property tax assessments for the last\r\nfive years, including assessed values, valuation methods, and records of\r\nany appeals or adjustments.\r\nI understand that the County Recorder's Office may not directly handle\r\nthese records. However, I expect guidance or a referral to the\r\nappropriate department or official who can provide these records. As per\r\nmy original request, any denial or inability to provide these records\r\nshould be accompanied by a legal justification, in line with State ex\r\nrel. Glasgow v. Jones.\r\nI anticipate a prompt response to this appeal, ideally within the\r\nstatutory timeframe. Non-compliance may necessitate further legal action\r\nto ensure adherence to Ohio's Public Records Act. I trust that the\r\nButler County Records Center will take this appeal seriously and respond\r\naccordingly.\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\r\nSincerely,\r\nJordan Lassiter\r\n---\r\nOn Jan. 12, 2024:\r\nSubject: Re: Fwd: Ohio Open Records Law Request: Comprehensive Request\r\nfor Records Related to Property at 9172 W Meadow Dr, West Chester, OH\r\n45069\r\nMr. Lassiter,\r\nThe public records request for the property at 9172 West Meadow Drive,\r\nWest Chester, Ohio 45069, has been brought to my attention.\r\nI appreciate your inquiry regarding the information you are seeking.\r\nUnfortunately, the scope of duties assigned to the county recorder, as\r\noutlined in the Ohio Revised Code 317, is limited to recording\r\ndocuments\r\nand making them publicly available for constructive notice. The county\r\nrecorder is not authorized to determine the legal sufficiency of\r\ndocuments or conduct a title search. Attached to this communication\r\nare\r\nthe recorded documents on file for the property since its platting in\r\n2019. \r\nFor a comprehensive title search, I recommend engaging the services of\r\na reputable title company. They possess the expertise needed to assess\r\nlegal sufficiency and provide a thorough title search for the property\r\nin question.\r\nAdditionally, if you are seeking information related to property tax\r\nassessments, values, and valuation methods, I suggest contacting the\r\ncounty auditor. The Chief Deputy, Lori Sullivan, can assist you with\r\nthis specific inquiry. She is reachable at\r\nsullivanl@butlercountyohio.org.\r\nFor details regarding building permits and zoning requests, please\r\nreach out to the Butler County Building & Zoning Department. The\r\ndirector, David Fehr is available at David.fehr@bcohio.us and will be\r\nable to provide information and assistance in these areas.\r\nI hope this guidance leads you to the information you are seeking.

(Please let us know if you have trouble using this link). Because the Office\u2019s Dropbox does not have unlimited storage, these documents and recordings will be removed after 30 days. Please download these documents and recordings to your own device before then.\r\n\r\nPlease note that certain personal information has been redacted from these records based on KRS 61.878(1)(a), which exempts from open records disclosure \u201cinformation of a personal nature where disclosure thereof would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Such information includes, but is not limited to, social security numbers, birthdates, addresses, telephone numbers, and financial information, the disclosure of which may leave persons at risk for identity theft. See Zink v. Commonwealth, 902 S.W.2d 825, 828-29 (Ky. App. 1994). Here, the redactions include personal email addresses, cell phone numbers, residential addresses, Zoom meeting passcodes and links, security codes, and similar personal information.\r\n\r\nPlease further note that the Office has withheld the following records, as they are exempt under the Act as further explained by category below:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Eighty-eight (91) emails between Bryan Hubbard and staff and attorneys in the Office discussing scheduling of meetings and appointments, which are exempt as they are interoffice, preliminary notes between staff and attorneys. See KRS 61.878(1)(i) and (j). Specifically, KRS 61.878(i) and (j) exempts from disclosure \u201c[p]reliminary drafts . . . notes . . . [p]reliminary recommendations, and preliminary memoranda in which opinions are expressed or policies formulated or recommended.\u201d Following the Kentucky Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning in Courier-Journal v. Jones, 895 S.W.2d 6 (Ky. App. 1995), this Office has routinely found that public officials\u2019 calendars, schedules, and itineraries are exempt from disclosure, see 05-ORD-018, and that \u201cpreliminary records that form the basis of those documents can be withheld.\u201d 08-ORD-217, p. 6. In Jones, the Court held that then-Governor Brereton Jones' appointment schedule was \u201cnothing more than a draft of what may or may never take place; a notation for inter or intra office use, so the daily affairs of the chief executive can be conducted with some semblance of orderliness; and all of which should be free from media interference.\u201d 895 S.W.2d at 10; See 08-ORD-217; 16-ORD-039. In adopting the logic of Times Mirror Co. v. Superior Court, 53 Cal. 3d 1325 (1991), the Jones Court made no distinction as to past schedules: Moreover, the risks of disclosure outline [sic] above apply in many cases regardless of whether the meetings are past or future. Participants may be chilled and discouraged by the knowledge that a meeting will routinely be disclosed, and executive judgments in ongoing policy matters may be prematurely revealed. 895 S.W.2d at 9. (quoting Times Mirror Co., 53 Cal. 3d at 1344).\r\n  2.  Five (5) emails between Bryan Hubbard and other attorneys and staff within the Office relating to the Office\u2019s biennial budget. These records are exempt as they are interoffice, preliminary notes, drafts, notes and/or preliminary content between staff and attorneys in which opinions are expressed. See KRS 61.878(1)(i) and (j). These emails are further exempt under KRS 61.878(1)(l) because they constitute confidential attorney-client communications between attorneys and staff in the Office related to the Office\u2019s discussions surrounding the biennial budget. KRE 503; Hahn v. Univ. of Louisville, 80 S.W.3d 771, 774 (Ky. App. 2001).\r\n  3.  Two-hundred seventy-eight (278) Outlook calendar appointments and invitations from Bryan Hubbard\u2019s calendar have also been withheld, which are exempt from disclosure under KRS 61.878(i) and (j). Specifically, KRS 61.878(i) and (j) exempts from disclosure \u201c[p]reliminary drafts . . . notes . . . [p]reliminary recommendations, and preliminary memoranda in which opinions are expressed or policies formulated or recommended.\u201d Following the Kentucky Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning in Courier-Journal v.

App. 1995), this Office has routinely found that public officials\u2019 calendars, schedules, and itineraries are exempt from disclosure, see 05-ORD-018, and that \u201cpreliminary records that form the basis of those documents can be withheld.\u201d 08-ORD-217, p. 6. In Jones, the Court held that then-Governor Brereton Jones' appointment schedule was \u201cnothing more than a draft of what may or may never take place; a notation for inter or intra office use, so the daily affairs of the chief executive can be conducted with some semblance of orderliness; and all of which should be free from media interference.\u201d 895 S.W.2d at 10; See 08-ORD-217; 16-ORD-039.

See 39 State Amicus Curiae Br. 2\u20133 in EPA v. Ellison, No. A20-1344 (Minn. 2021) (\u201cthe common-interest doctrine has become a nearly ubiquitous feature of American jurisprudence. At least 20 states have codified the doctrine in their statutory codes or rules of evidence, while over a dozen more have recognized the doctrine as a common-law feature of the attorney-client privilege.\u201d (citations omitted).\r\n  6.

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

        "communication": "To whoever it may concern: \r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request pursuant to the Public Records Act, G.L. c.66, \u00a710, for public records in the custody of your school district. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k). The purpose of this request is to determine whether your school district and police department are complying with their reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice Reform Act.  \u201cThe public has an interest in knowing whether public servants are carrying out their duties in an efficient and law-abiding manner.\u201d    \r\n\r\nIt would be ill-advised to impose a fee for data that your school district may have failed to report in violation of statutory and regulatory duty.  Moreover, as you know, municipalities with a population of over 20,000 may not assess a fee for the first 2 hours of time spent searching for, compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. Finally, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(i), a records access officer shall assess no fee greater than the lowest hourly rate of a person capable of compiling, segregating, redacting and reproducing a requested record. In the event that a charge is incurred for this request which you will not waive, please so indicate and include an itemization of estimated good faith costs.\r\n \r\nPlease provide public records to a requestor in an electronic format unless the record is not available in an electronic format. G.L.c. 66, \u00a7 6A(d). \r\n\r\nThe Public Records Act requires that you comply with this request within ten (10) business days following receipt. If you believe that documents or data responsive to any request herein is not public record and thus not subject to disclosure, please set forth in writing the specific reasons for such assertion, including the specific exemption or exemptions that you believe apply.  To the extent that you determine that records need to be redacted in order to be produced under any law protecting the privacy of named individuals, please do so rather than withholding them in their entirety.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this request, or need additional time to respond, please contact me by phone at (617)-373-5862 or by email at k.stathulis@northeastern.edu. Thank you in advance for your prompt response to this request.\r\n\t\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Stathulis, Esq.\r\nCenter for Public Interest, Advocacy, and Collaboration\r\nNortheastern University School of Law",

I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 5 business days, as the statute requires. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nRose Terse \r\n\r\nYour request has been forwarded to Internal Affairs Staff in the Spokane Police Department for review and compiling of any responsive records. \r\nThe records you seek include a list of individuals. An appellate court decision, SEIU Healthcare 775 NW v. DSHS, 193 Wn. App. 377 (2016) holds that when a city receives a request for documents that includes a list of individuals, the City is required to determine whether the list will be used for \u201ccommercial purposes.\u201d The case concluded that a requestor has a commercial purpose if the requestor intends to use the list for direct or indirect profit-making activity, regardless of whether the requestor intends to contact the individuals on the list or even if the individuals are personally affected by the release of the list or not. If the City has some indication that a requester intends to use a list of individuals for a commercial purpose, we are required to \u201cinvestigate further\u201d before we disclose that list. \r\n\r\nFurther, the SEIU case held that even an affirmation stating that any responsive records received for a request which include lists of individuals will not be used for commercial purposes, is not sufficient.\u00a0 Instead, before we can release the records containing the requested information, we are required to obtain from you sufficient details as to what you intend to use the list for so that we can make an independent evaluation as to whether or not your purpose is commercial or not. \r\n\r\nPlease fill out and return the attached Commercial Purpose Declaration. A determination will then be made as to whether your stated purpose regarding the use of the list(s) of individuals contained in any compiled responsive records is sufficient to allow for the release of this information. To avoid unnecessary delay in obtaining these specific responsive records for your request, please return the completed declaration at your earliest opportunity. We will follow up with you within five business days as to the validity of the stated purpose relating to your request. \r\nPlease provide the completed affidavit as soon as possible, but within 30 days of today\u2019s date, or by November 29, 2023. If a completed declaration determined to be valid is not received in the City Clerk's Office by that date, your request will be considered concluded and closed, and a new request will be required in this matter after November 29. \r\nContingent upon receiving a completed declaration determined to be valid, we anticipate responsive records will be available in approximately 30 days, or on or about November 29.\u00a0 If responsive records become available in advance of that date, we will let you know.\u00a0 Likewise, if more time is required, we will advise as such. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nLaurie Farnsworth \r\nSpokane Deputy City Clerk",

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act,  school districts and law enforcement agencies must \u201cspecify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u201d (DESE).   DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement.  DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection.  \r\n\r\nA school-related arrest \u201c[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d  \r\n\r\nA referral to law enforcement \u201c[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.\u201d   \r\n\r\n\r\nI request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7 (twenty-sixth): \r\n\r\n1.\tAn extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns:\r\na.\tDate of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nb.\tTime of arrest or referral to law enforcement\r\nc.\tCharge (or charges)\r\nd.\tWhether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ne.\tSex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nf.\tAge of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ng.\tRace of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nh.\tEthnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\ni.\tDisability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement\r\nj.\tWhether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school.\r\nk.\tName of arresting officer, if applicable, and \r\nl.\tBadge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable.\r\n\r\n2.\tIf such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). \r\n\r\n3.\tA copy of any active standard operating procedures developed with the police department and/or other law enforcement agencies regarding police placement or activity in your corresponding school;  and,\r\n\r\n4.\tAny records instructing or informing police personnel of, or otherwise describing data reporting requirements and procedures for complying with G.L. c. 71 \u00a7 37P(b).\r\n\r\n5.\tThe cost to the school district of assigning a school resource officer to each school; and, \r\n\r\n6.\tThe total number of school resource officers and total number of guidance counselors for each school in your district for school years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and,\r\n\r\n7.\tThe total number and a brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022, and, \r\n\r\n8.\tA description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support personnel for the school district.\r\n\r\nAs this request involves a matter of public interest and will not be used for any commercial purpose, we ask that all fees associated with this request be waived pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07(2)(k).

I hereby request the following records:\r\n\r\nJames Earl Ray (March 10, 1928 \u2013 April 23, 1998) was an American convicted of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Ray was convicted on his 41st birthday after entering a guilty plea to forgo a jury trial. Had he been found guilty by jury trial, he would have been eligible for the death penalty. He was sentenced to 99 years in prison. He later recanted his confession and tried unsuccessfully to gain access to a retrial. In 1998, Ray died in prison of complications due to chronic hepatitis C infection. His death has been widely reported. http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/24/us/james-earl-ray-70-killer-of-dr-king-dies-in-nashville.html?pagewanted=all\r\n\r\nPlease conduct a search of the Central Records System, including but not limited to the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices, for both main-file records and cross-reference records.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the news media and request classification as such.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Best",

Separately, you will receive a Dropbox email with responsive records.  For clarity's sake, I include your requests and our replies.\r\n1)      All instruction manuals, handbooks, and policies provided to department employees regarding the use of the department's machine learning unemployment benefits fraud detection system (As described here: https://www.10tv.com/article/news/investigations/10-investigates/after-paying-out-228-million-in-fraudulent-unemployment-claims-ohio-turns-to-google-others-for-help/530-64ff75b4-a9ef-4a4b-afca-9dbb60036890<https://www.10tv.com/article/news/investigations/10-investigates/after-paying-out-228-million-in-fraudulent-unemployment-claims-ohio-turns-to-google-others-for-help/530-64ff75b4-a9ef-4a4b-afca-9dbb60036890> and here https://data.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/data/projects/jfs+fighting+covid+fraud<https://data.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/data/projects/jfs+fighting+covid+fraud>).\r\n\r\n      No manuals or training materials were created for the fraud dashboard. Likewise, no training manuals were created for the Google dashboard. We will be producing, by Dropbox, training materials provided to staff on Experian and Lexis Nexus ID Proofing. There is a single training video that we are reviewing to ensure it contains no Confidential Personal Information, which is exempted from production as a public record.  Once that review is completed, I will be in touch.\r\n2)      Aggregate, de-identified data showing how many unemployment benefit claims the system flagged as having at least one indicator of fraud each week since the department's machine learning unemployment benefits fraud detection system was launched.\r\n\r\n      ODJFS has and will provide via Dropbox responsive records as of January 1, 2022, but we do not possess requested records prior to that date, and we are not required to create new records to satisfy this request. State ex rel. White v. Goldsberry, 85 Ohio St.3d 153, 707 N.E.2d 496 (1999).\r\n3)      Aggregate, de-identified data showing how many unemployment benefit claims were submitted, approved, and denied in each week since Jan. 1, 2018.\r\n\r\n      Although we already provided resources to you regarding this request in our email of July 7, 2023, we respond here with our legal analysis of the same. You asked for documentation regarding which unemployment benefit claims were \"approved, and denied in each week since Jan. 1, 2018.\"  To our knowledge the links that we provided do not show approvals or denials. ODJFS also does not have other public records that provide that level of detail.  As noted above, ODJFS is not required to create a public record to satisfy this this request. State ex rel. White v. Goldsberry, 85 Ohio St.3d 153, 707 N.E.2d 496 (1999).\r\n4)      Aggregate, de-identified data showing how many unemployment benefit claims were investigated for potential fraud in each week since Jan 1, 2018.\r\n\r\n      ODJFS does not possess a record that is responsive to this request and is not required to generate such a request.  State ex rel. Kerner v. State Teachers Retirement Bd., 82 Ohio St.3d 273, 275, 1998-Ohio-242, 695 N.E.2d 256 (holding that an agency is not required to reprogram computers to comply with a public records request).  We note that some of the requested detail can be found at the ETA website that tracks determination information, Data Downloads (doleta.gov)<https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/DataDownloads.asp>. It is in ETA 227, Section B (Number of Cases Investigated).\r\n5)      Aggregate, de-identified data showing how many unemployment benefit claims were confirmed as fraudulent after investigation each week since Jan. 1, 2018.\r\n\r\n      ODJFS does not possess a record that is responsive to this request and is not required to generate such a request.  State ex rel. Kerner v. State Teachers Retirement Bd., 82 Ohio St.3d 273, 275, 1998-Ohio-242, 695 N.E.2d 256 (holding that an agency is not required to reprogram computers to comply with a public records request).  We note that the ETA 227 report would provide the number of fraud overpayments established by quarter for Regular UI, and there are separate ETA 227 reports for PEUC, MEUC, and FPUC.  Similarly, the ETA 902 report would provide the number of fraud overpayments established by month for PUA.  As with the ETA 227, there is a separate ETA 902 report for FPUC which includes PUA and FPUC data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNicole S.

However, in a previous court filing, ODJFS stated that \"(b)y March 2021, the Google Fraud Software created by Google was live.\"\r\n\r\n1) Could you please provide the missing data (from March 2021 through December 31, 2022)?\r\n\r\n2) I would like to confirm that the data you've provided in response to my request (the number of initial claims flagged as potentially fraudulent per week) is equivalent to the data ODJFS has been publishing since July 2 in its weekly claims updates (see: https://jfs.ohio.gov/static/ocomm/pdf/July%202%20-%20July%208%202023%20Ohio%20Jobless%20Claims.pdf). In other words, is my understanding correct that the flagged claims in the data you provided from January through June 17 of this year would also have been \" flagged for more stringent identity verification, to ensure they are not fraudulent,\" as the later press releases state?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your continued help, and please let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nTodd Feathers",

However, in a previous court filing, ODJFS stated that \"(b)y March 2021, the Google Fraud Software created by Google was live.\"\r\n\r\n1) Could you please provide the missing data (from March 2021 through December 31, 2022)?\r\n\r\n2) I would like to confirm that the data you've provided in response to my request (the number of initial claims flagged as potentially fraudulent per week) is equivalent to the data ODJFS has been publishing since July 2 in its weekly claims updates (see: https://jfs.ohio.gov/static/ocomm/pdf/July%202%20-%20July%208%202023%20Ohio%20Jobless%20Claims.pdf). In other words, is my understanding correct that the flagged claims in the data you provided from January through June 17 of this year would also have been \" flagged for more stringent identity verification, to ensure they are not fraudulent,\" as the later press releases state?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your continued help, and please let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nTodd Feathers",

        "communication": "Dear Custodian of Records:\r\n\r\nThis letter constitutes a request under the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, submitted with the assistance of MuckRock News. \r\n\r\nWe request the following records related to Automated License Plate Readers (\"ALPRs\") and your law enforcement agency (\"Agency\").\r\n\r\nPart A - Information related to ALPR data sharing.\r\n\r\nA1. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares ALPR data;\r\nA2. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives ALPR data;\r\nA3. The names of agencies and organizations with which the Agency shares \u201chot list\u201d information;\r\nA4. The names of agencies and organizations from which the Agency receives \u201chot list\u201d information.\r\nThe information requested in items A1-A4 is readily available for extraction through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Data Sharing Report function. With Flock Safety, this information is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  \r\n\r\nMost agencies have encountered little difficulty in providing this information (see below). In a small number of cases, an agency has interpreted items A1-A4 as requesting the creation of a record that does not exist. We disagree: this data is maintained by your software, can be exported through software your agency has already purchased, and is therefore subject to CPRA. \r\n\r\nHowever, should you disagree, you may alternatively produce the following records:  \r\n\r\nA5. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents that external agencies have signed to comply with Sec 1798.90.52(b) for accessing your agency's ALPR data. These documents are also often required under the \"Releasing ALPR Data\" subsection of a California law enforcement agency's SB 34 policy. \r\nA6. All agreements, memoranda of understanding, requests, or other certifying documents  that your agency has signed pursuant to Sec 1798.90.52(b) to access other agencies' ALPR data.\r\nA7. All \"records of access\" required by Sec. 1798.90.52(a) for the periods January 1, 2021 until the date of processing this request. \r\n\r\nItems A5-A7 are not necessary if your agency provides the information requested in items A1-A4. We feel that items A1-A4 are more focused and would require less labor from your agency to produce. \r\n\r\nPart B - Information Related to Numbers of \u201cDetections\u201d (plate scans) and \u201cHits\u201d (plate scans that matched to a hotlist)\r\n\r\nB1. The aggregate number of \"detections\" collected during 2023.\r\nB2.  The aggregate number of \u201chits\u201d during 2023.\r\n\r\nThe information requested in items B1-B2 is readily available through the ALPR software you use. For example, with Vigilant Solutions/Motorola Solutions, this data can be exported easily using the Hit Ratio Report function. With Flock Safety, this information  is available through the transparency portal function. Other software, such as BOSS, has similar functionality.  As noted above, this information exists within your system and can be easily exported with existing software.\r\n\r\nPart C - Assistance, Description, and Recommendations. \r\n\r\nWe make the following requests under section 6253.1 of the California Public Records Act\r\n\r\nC1. A description of  the information technology and physical location in which the records exist.\r\nC2. Assist us identifying records and information that will help the public understand how ALPR data and hotlists are shared, how much data is collected year-to-year, and how much of that data matches a hot list; and \r\nC3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the information sought.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your agency provided substantially similar data in 2022. \r\n\r\nCPRA requires you to undertake reasonable efforts to locate responsive records and to work in good faith with requesters to respond to their request. See CYAC v. City of National City, 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1430 (2013). Thus under the CPRA you are obligated to conduct a reasonable search and cannot deny a request merely because it might generate a large volume of records. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please respond to this request within 10 days either by providing all the requested records or by providing a written response setting forth the legal authority on which you rely in withholding or redacting any document, as well as stating when documents will be made available. Should you choose to withhold or reject this request, we ask that you provide an explanation of why your agency is responding differently compared to the many others that have complied with our request. \r\n\r\nWe also request that any records maintained in an electronic format be provided in that same format (such as a PDF, CSV or XLS file), to avoid copying costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, should you be unable to do so, EFF will reimburse you for the direct costs of copying these records (if you elect to charge for copying) plus postage. If you anticipate that these costs will exceed $25.00, or that the time needed to copy the records will delay their release, please contact me so that I can arrange to inspect the documents or decide which documents I wish to have copied. Please also provide an invoice and a cost breakdown of the fee estimate. If the fees are less than $25.00, please copy and send the records and invoice as soon as possible, and we will promptly pay the required costs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request. If you have any questions or concerns, or if I can provide any clarification that will help identify responsive documents or focus this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at (415) 436-9333 x151 or dm@eff.org. You may also mail correspondence to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy. St. San Francisco, CA, 94109.\r\n                                               \r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\n \r\nDave Maass\r\nDirector of Investigations\r\nElectronic Frontier Foundation",

Records/documents that relate to employer abuse of F.S. 112.0455, including but not limited to making false or fictitious statements to Florida Department of Regulations Workers\u2019 Compensation Division, and the consequences of an employer abusing the aforementioned Florida Statute.\r\n\r\n4.Records/documents that relate to employer consequences, ramifications, or disciplinary actions when intentionally abusing or defrauding the Florida Department of Financial Services per F.S. 112.0455  (as an example, by trick or deceit, lack of reasonable suspicion, making materially false or fictitious statements).\r\n\r\n5.

Records/documents relating to a private employer in which such employer could be considered a state actor, acting on behalf of the government, or under the direction of the government within the context of reasonable suspicion testing.\r\n\r\n7. Records/documents relating to if or in what manner an employer\u2019s policies can extend beyond the scope of the F.S. 112.0455 and the Florida Department of Financial Services\u2019 guidelines (if such records exist).\r\n\r\n8.

Specifically, we seek emails sent or received, calendar entries for appointments to discuss either of the deaths in custody, Teams messages, the contents of SharePoint drive folders regarding ICE's public statements regarding these deaths, and any records relied upon to assert the factual matters in ICE's post-death release statements, posted here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/brazilian-man-ice-custody-passes-away-new-mexico-hospital?s=09\r\nand here: \r\nhttps://www.ice.gov/news/releases/nicaraguan-man-ice-custody-passes-away-colorado-hospital\r\n\r\nBy definition, the information requested cannot be subject to withholding under Exemption 7A (open investigations), because ICE has already released its core facts publicly.\r\n\r\nWe seek expedited processing of this request under 6 C.F.R. 5.5(e), and make the following statements under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 USC 1746 in support thereof: \r\n1. Both the Torrance in-custody death and the Aurora in-custody death have been met with calls from elected Representatives and Senators for vigorous investigation, based on each facility's documented track record. See https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/heinrich-leads-request-for-immediate-action-from-ice-to-address-inhumane-unsafe-conditions-for-migrants-at-the-torrance-county-detention-facility and https://crow.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/crow.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2022.10.21-final-icedhs-letter_0.pdf. \r\n\r\n2.

Your request was received in this office on 11/8/2022.After careful review of your FOIA request, we determined that your request is 1) too broad in scope, 2) did not specifically identify the records which you are seeking, or 3) only posed questions to the agency.  Records must be described in reasonably sufficient detail to enable government employees who are familiar with the subject area to locate records without placing an unreasonable burden upon the agency.  For this reason, \u00a75.3(b) of the DHS regulations, 6 C.F.R. Part 5, require that you describe the records you are seeking with as much information as possible to ensure that our search can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.  Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipients, and subject matter of the records, if known, or the ICE program office you believe created and/or controls the record.  The FOIA does not require an agency to create new records, answer questions posed by requesters, or attempt to interpret a request that does not identify specific records.  Please resubmit your request containing a reasonable description of the records you are seeking.  Upon receipt of a perfected request, you will be advised as to the status of your request.If we do not hear from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, we will assume you are no longer interested in this FOIA request, and the case will be administratively closed.  Please be advised that this action is not a denial of your request and will not preclude you from filing other requests in the future. If you have any questions please contact FOIA Public Liaison Marcus Francis at (866) 633-1182 or the address above.Your request has been assigned reference number 2023-ICFO-03462.
