No official format is required for making a records request; however, agencies may recommend that requestors submit requests using an agency provided form or web page.\"\r\n\r\nThis public records request is being made via email. This public records request will be honored and fulfilled by your agency via email as requested or relief will be sought per statute.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ELECTRONIC FORMAT\r\n\r\nPlease provide all identified public records in their NATIVE electronic format, either .pst file or .pdf PORTFOLIO file.

I declare this public records request is not being made for any commercial purpose whatsoever. Also, this public records request is not being made for a \"list of individuals.\" This declaration satisfies all requirements of RCW 42.56 regarding prohibitions on lists and commercial purposes. No additional commercial purpose declaration will be completed for this public records request.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PUBLIC RECORDS *** ANTICIPATE LITIGATION ***\r\n\r\nWAC 44-14-03005 RETENTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS\r\n\r\nThe lawful destruction of public records is governed by retention schedules. The unlawful destruction of public records can be a crime. RCW 40.16.010 and 40.16.020. An agency is prohibited from destroying a public record, even if it is about to be lawfully destroyed under a retention schedule, if a public records request has been made for that record. RCW 42.56.100. Additional retention requirements might apply if the records may be relevant to actual or anticipated litigation. The agency is required to retain the record until the record request has been resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: An agency can be found to violate the Public Records Act and be subject to the attorneys' fees and penalty provision if it prematurely destroys a requested record after a request is made. See Yacobellis v. City of Bellingham, 55 Wn. App. 706, 780 P.2d 272 (1989). However, it is not a violation of the Public Records Act if a record is destroyed prior to an agency's receipt of a public records request for that record. Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Wash. v. McCarthy, 152 Wn. App. 720, 218 P.3d 196 (2009); West v. Dep't of Nat. Res., 163 Wn. App. 238, 258 P.3d 78 (2011). The Public Records Act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the records retention statutes (chapter 40.14 RCW) are two different laws.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION VIA EMAIL\r\n\r\nPlease send all requests for clarification, status updates, and production of responsive electronic documents via direct email reply.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

        "communication": "Dear FBI:\r\n\r\nThis is a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nRECORDS REQUESTED\r\n\r\nI request all records related to Black poet and activist Nikki Giovanni. Ms. Giovanni was born on 7 June 1943 in Knoxville, Tennessee, USA and died on 9 December 2024.\r\n\r\nOTHER NAMES USED\r\n\r\nThe subject was born Yolande Cornelia Giovanni Jr.\r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH\r\n\r\nI have attached Ms. Giovanni's news obituary from the Washington Post.\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH \r\n\r\nSCOPE OF SEARCH: In addition to the standard search for records, I further request a search of the Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) Indices, the Microphone Surveillance (MISUR) Indices, the Physical Surveillance (FISUR) Indices, and the Technical Surveillance (TESUR) Indices.\r\n\r\nIf any potentially responsive records have been destroyed or transferred to NARA, then I request copies of the destruction or transfer slips as well as any other documentation relating the transfer or destruction. \r\n\r\nREQUEST FOR FEE WAIVER\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks records created or maintained by the FBI.\r\n\r\n2. The records must be likely to contribute to the understanding of the subject of the request. My request satisfies this factor because it seeks information that, to my knowledge, is not already in the public domain. Of course, without already knowing what records the Bureau has, I can't say for sure whether those records are already in the public domain or what the public would learn from them; however, because Ms. Giovanni has recently died, the Bureau may now be able to release records that were not previously available via the FOIA/PA.\r\n\r\nThere are specific reasons to believe that the records will contribute to the public\u2019s understanding of Ms. Giovanni, because Ms. Giovanni was apparently the subject of Bureau surveillance. According to her Washington Post obituary: \r\n\r\n3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public\u2014meaning a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject\u2014as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. My request satisfies this factor because Ms. Giovanni was a public figure. News obituaries for Ms. Giovanni appeared in the Washington Post and the New York Times, among other publications. According to her Washington Post obituary: \"Ms. Giovanni...noted in an interview with the Pittsburgh Press that she was occasionally visited by the bureau\u2019s agents. 'I used to invite them in for coffee because I knew they wanted to check out the place.' She stopped doing so, she added, because she got 'a white shag rug and they all wear cloddy shoes.'\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c[S]he was a rare poet-celebrity, chatting with guest host Flip Wilson on 'The Tonight Show' and appearing on television shows such as \u2018Soul!' to interview James Baldwin, Lena Horne and Muhammad Ali about Black art and identity. In 1973, she was a National Book Award finalist for 'Gemini: An Extended Autobiographical Statement on My First Twenty-Five Years of Being a Black Poet.'\r\nMs. Giovanni celebrated her 30th birthday that year by performing at the Lincoln Center in Manhattan, accompanied by the New York Community Choir and singers Melba Moore and Wilson Pickett.\"\r\n\r\nThus, a broad audience of persons will likely be interested in the records I seek.\r\n\r\nI am also making this request via MuckRock.com, a FOIA-and-journalism site that will allow anyone in the world to access all responsive records online for free.\r\n\r\n4. The public's understanding must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. My request likely satisfies this factor because Ms. Giovanni has recently died\u2014meaning that the Bureau can now release responsive records that it could not have released before. Again, I cannot be 100% sure if factor is satisfied without already knowing what records the Bureau has. However, given Ms. Giovanni's status as a public figure, the Bureau should deem this factor satisfied.\r\n\r\nCommercial Interest Factors\r\n\r\n1. The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: I have no commercial interest whatsoever in these records; I am just a curious American citizen with an interest in his government. Thus, this factor cuts in favor of a fee waiver.\r\n\r\n2. The primary interest in disclosure, i.e., whether disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester: I have zero commercial interest in disclosure, therefore the public interest outweighs my (nonexistent) private interest.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nOn balance, all of the Bureau's regulatory factors tilt decisively in favor of granting me a fee waiver. If you do decide to charge me fees, please notify me in advance if you anticipate that those fees will exceed $25.\r\n\r\nFORM OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nI would prefer that you fulfill this request electronically, producing responsive records via email attachment if available or on CD-ROM if not. If previously released records are available, then I request a rolling release consisting of those records while additional records are located and processed for release.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThank you for responding to this request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nNicholas Marritz",

These reports should cover a wide range of impacted areas, including but not limited to commercial properties (businesses, industrial zones), public infrastructure (schools, government buildings), and residential neighborhoods. I expect a full and exhaustive record of each incident, its causes, its scope, and its impact on local water quality.\r\n\r\n2. **Complete and thorough documentation** of any water filtration systems that have been evaluated, implemented, or planned in response to water contamination from firefighting efforts, sewage, or any other hazardous substances. This must include detailed information on the technologies considered or used, including specifications, effectiveness, cost estimates, and the precise locations where these systems were or will be applied.\r\n\r\n3. **A comprehensive list of contact information** for individuals responsible for water quality assessments and decisions regarding the implementation of filtration systems for all types of contamination. This list must include the names, titles, phone numbers, and email addresses of all relevant decision-makers\u2014ensuring that I can directly reach all key individuals involved in addressing this crisis.\r\n\r\nThis request is not only a legal right under **Government Code \u00a7 6253(a)**, which mandates public agencies to provide access to records in a timely and efficient manner, but also a matter of urgent public health and safety. The potential consequences of ongoing water contamination demand full transparency and immediate action. I expect a prompt and thorough response to this request, as failure to provide these records or unjustified delays will result in further legal action, including but not limited to a formal appeal under **Government Code \u00a7 6259**.\r\n\r\nThe urgency and significance of this matter cannot be overstated. Lives, health, and the environment are at risk, and it is imperative that the public is fully informed about the scope of contamination and the measures being taken to mitigate it. I trust you will treat this request with the gravity it deserves.\r\n\r\nThank you for your immediate attention to this critical issue.\r\n\r\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 calendar days, as the statute requires.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nEric B",
